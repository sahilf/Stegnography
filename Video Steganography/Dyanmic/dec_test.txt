Prologue
Some people are good at taking decisions. I am not one of them. Some people fall asleep quickly at
night. I am not one of them either. It is 3 in the morning. I have tossed and turned in bed for two
hours. I am to get married in fifteen hours. We have over 200 guests in the hotel, here to attend my
grand destination wedding in Goa. I brought them here. Everyone is excited. After all, it is the first
destination wedding in the Mehta family.
I am the bride. I should get my beauty sleep. I cant. The last thing I care about right now is
beauty. The only thing I care about is how to get out of this mess. Because, like it often happens to
me, here I am in a situation where I dont know what the fuck is going on.
W
1
hat do you mean, not enough rooms? I said to Arijit Banerjee, the lobby manager of the Goa
Marriott.
See, what I am trying to explain is. . . Arijit began in his modulated, courteous voice when
mom cut him off.
Its my daughters wedding. Are you going to shame us? she said, her volume loud enough to
startle the rest of the reception staff.
No, maam. Just a shortage of twenty rooms. You booked a hundred. We had only promised
eighty then. We hoped to give more but the chief minister had a function and. . .
What do we tell our guests who have come all the way from America? mom said.
If I may suggest, there is another hotel two kilometres away, Arijit said.
We have to be together. You are going to ruin my daughters wedding for some sarkaari
function? my mother said, bosom heaving, breath heavyclassic warning signs of an upcoming
storm.
Mom, go sit with dad, please. I will sort this out, I said. Mom glared at me. How could I, the
bride, do all this in the first place? I should be worried about my facials, not room allocations.
The boys side arrives in less than three hours. I cant believe this, she muttered, walking to
the sofa at the centre of the lobby. My father sat there along with Kamla bua, his elder sister. Other
uncles and aunts occupied the remaining couches in the lobbya Mehta takeover of the Marriott. My
mother looked at my father, a level-two glare. It signified: Will you ever take the initiative?
My father shifted in his seat. I refocused on the lobby manager.
What can be done now, Arijit? I said. My entire family is here.
We had come on the morning flight from Delhi. The Gulatis, the boys side, would take off
from Mumbai at 3 p.m. and land in Goa at 4. Twenty hired Innovas would bring them to the hotel by 5.
I checked the time2.30 p.m.
See, maam, we have set up a special desk for the MehtaGulati wedding, Arijit said. We
are doing the check-ins for your family now.
He pointed to a makeshift counter at the far corner of the lobby where three female Marriott
employees with permanent smiles sat. They welcomed everyone with folded hands. Each guest
received a shell necklace, a set of key cards for the room, a map of the Marriott Goa property and a
wedding information booklet. The booklet contained the entire programme for the week, including
the time, venue and other details of the ceremonies.
My side will take fifty rooms. The Gulatis need fifty too, I said.
If you take fifty, maam, we will only have thirty left for them, Arijit said.
Where is Suraj? I said. Suraj was the owner of Moonshine Events, the event manager we had
appointed for the wedding. We will manage last minute is what he had told me.
At the airport, Arijit said.
My father ambled up to the reception desk. Everything okay, beta?
I explained the situation to him.
Thirty rooms! The Gulatis have 120 guests, my father said.
Exactly. I threw up my hands.
Mom and Kamla bua came to the reception as well. I told Sudarshan also, why all this Goa
business? Delhi has so many nice banquet halls and farmhouses. Seems like you have money to
waste, Kamla bua said.
I wanted to retort but my mother gave me the Mother Look.
They are our guests, I reminded myself. I let out a huge breath.
How many from our side? my mother said.
Mehta family has 117 guests, maam, Arijit said, counting from his reservation sheets.
If we only have eighty, that is forty rooms for each side, I said. Lets reallocate. Stop the
check-ins for the Mehtas right now.
Arijit signalled the smiling ladies at the counter. They stopped the smiles and the check-ins
and put the shell necklaces back in the drawer.
How can we reduce the rooms for the boys side? my mother said in a shocked voice.
What else to do? I said.
How many rooms are they expecting? she said.
Fifty, I said. Call them now. They will readjust their allocations on the way here.
How can you ask the boys side to adjust? Kamla bua said. Aparna, are you serious?
My mother looked at Kamla bua and me.
But how can we manage in only thirty rooms? I said and turned to my father. Dad, call
them.
Sudarshan, dont insult them before they even arrive, Kamla bua said. We will manage in
thirty rooms. Its okay. Some of us will sleep on the floor.
Nobody needs to sleep on the floor, bua, I said. I am sorry this screw-up happened. But if
we have forty rooms each, it is three to a room. With so many kids anyway, it should be fine.
We can manage in thirty, my mother said.
Mom? Thats four to a room. While the Gulatis will have so much space. Lets tell them.
No, my mother said. We cant do that.
Why?
They are the boys side. Little bit also you dont understand?
I didnt want to lose it at my own wedding, definitely not in the first hour of arrival. I turned to
my father. Dad, its no big deal. His family will understand. We are here for six nights. It will get too
tight for us, I said.
Dad, of course, would not listen. These two women, his wife and sister, controlled his remote.
For once, both of them were on the same page as well.
Beta, these are norms. You dont understand. We have to keep them comfortable. Girls side
is expected to adjust, he said.
I argued for five more minutes. It didnt work. I had to relent. And do what the girls side
needs to doadjust.
You and Aditi take a room, my mother said, referring to my sister.
Let her be with her husband. What will jiju think? I said.
Anil will adjust with the other gents, Kamla bua said.
Over the next twenty minutes the two women sorted the extended Mehta family comprising 117
people into thirty rooms. They used a complex algorithm with criteria like the people sharing the
room should not hate each other (warring relatives were put in different rooms) or be potentially
attracted to each other (mixed gender rooms were avoided, even if it involved people aged eightyplus).
Kids were packed five to a room, often with a grandparent. Kamla bua, herself a widow,
dramatically offered to sleep on the floor in my parents room, causing my father to offer his own bed
and sleep on the floor instead. Of course, Arijit kept saying that they would put extra beds in the
room. But how can you compare sleeping on an extra Marriott bed with the Punjabi buas eternal
sacrifice of sleeping on the floor?
I am happy with roti and achaar, Kamla bua said.
Its the Marriott. There is enough food, bua, I said.
I am just saying.
Can you please focus on the reallocations? We all need to be checked in before the Gulatis
arrive, I said.
In the middle of this chaos, I forgot what I had come here for. I had come to change my life
forever. To do something Id never believed in my whole life. To do something I never thought I
would. I had come to have an arranged marriage.
Here I was, lost in logistics, guest arrangements and bua tantrums. I took a moment to reflect.
I will be married in a week. To a guy I hardly know. This guy and I are to share a bed, home
and life for the rest of my life.
Why isnt it sinking in? Why am I fighting with Suraj on chat instead?
Me: Major screw-up on rooms, Suraj. Not cool.
Suraj: Sorry. Really sorry. Political reasons. Tried. Really.
Me: What else is going to get screwed up?
Suraj: Nothing. IndiGo from Mumbai just landed. We are ready to receive guests. See you
soon.
I went to the MehtaGulati check-in desk. All my family guests had checked in. Some did
grumble about sharing a room with three others but most seemed fine. Mom said that the grumblers
were the jealous types, the relatives who couldnt stand the fact that we had reached a level where
we could do a destination wedding in Goa. The supportive ones, according to mom, were those who
understood what it was like to be the girls side.
Do not use this girls side and boys side logic with me again. I dont like it, I said.
Mom and I were sitting in the lobby, ensuring that the staff readied the special check-in desk for the
Gulatis.
Can you stop waving your feminism flag for a week? This is a wedding, not an NGO activist
venue, my mother said.
But. . .
I know you are paying for it. Still, beta, protocol is protocol.
It is a sexist protocol.
Did you figure out your parlour appointments? Aditi also wants hair and make-up all six
days.
I love how my mother can throw another topic into the conversation if she doesnt want to
answer me.
Of course she does, I said.
Now go change, mom said.
What?
You are going to meet the boys side in jeans and T-shirt? And look at your neck!
Again you said boys side. And whats wrong with my neck?
There is no jewellery. Go change into a salwar-kameez and wear a chain from my jewellery
box.
I have just arrived. I am working to settle the guests in. Why am I expected to doll up? Is the
boy expected to dress up right after he gets off a flight?
My mother folded her hands. When logic fails, she does this, brings both her hands together
dramatically. Strangely, it works.
I relented and stood up. She handed me the key cards to her and my room. I went to her room
first. I took out a gold necklace, the thinnest and least hideous of them all. Why am I agreeing to this?
I wondered even as I wore it. Maybe because I failed when I did things my way. All the womens
empowerment and feminism bullshit didnt really take me anywhere, right? Maybe Kamla bua and
moms way was the right way.
I went to my room. Four huge suitcases were crammed into the walking space in the corridor.
Two giant bags belonged to my sister, who had essentially packed a retail stores worth of dresses for
herself.
I opened one of my suitcases, took out a yellow silk salwar-kameez with a slim zari border.
My mother had told me, no cottons this week. I undressed. I looked at myself in the mirror. My wavy
hair had grown, and now reached my shoulders. I looked slimthe two-month diet before the
wedding had helped. The black La Perla lingerie I had purchased in Hong Kong also gave a little lift
here and a little tuck there. Expensive underwear can make any woman look sexy, a little voice in my
head said. Some men in the past had called me sexy, but they could have been biased. Why am I
always so hard on myself? Why couldnt they have genuinely found me sexy? Well, it didnt matter
now. I would be undressing in front of a new man soon. The thought made me shudder.
I walked closer to the mirror. I saw my face up-close. Its all happening, Radhika, I said out
loud.
Hi, I am Radhika Mehta and I am getting married this week. I am twenty-seven years old. I
grew up in Delhi. I now work in London, at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. I am a vice
president in the Distressed Debt Group. Thank you for reading my story. However, let me warn you.
You may not like me too much. One, I make a lot of money. Two, I have an opinion on everything.
Three, Ive had sex. Now if I was a guy you would be okay with all of this. But since I am a girl these
three things dont really make me too likeable, do they?
I am also a bit of a nerd. My sister, Aditi, and I went to school together in Delhi at
Springdales, Pusa Road. She is just a year older than me. My parents wanted a son for their firstborn.
When Aditi came, they had to undo the damage as soon as possible. Hence, my father, SBI Naraina
Vihar Branch Manager Sudarshan Mehta, decided to have another child with his homemaker wife,
Aparna Mehta. Sadly for them, the second was also a girl, which was me. It is rumoured that they
tried again twice; both times my mother had an abortion because it was a girl. I confronted her on this
topic years ago, but she brushed it off.
I dont remember, actually, she said, but I am happy with my two daughters.
You dont remember two abortions?
You will judge me, so no point telling you. You dont know what it is like to be without a
son.
I had stopped asking her after that.
In school, Aditi didi was a hundred times more popular than me. She was the girl boys had
crushes on. I was the girl who started to wear spectacles in class six. Aditi didi is fair-complexioned.
I am what they call wheatish in matrimonial ads (why dont they call white-skinned people rice-ish?).
We look like the beforeafter pictures in a fairness cream ad; Im the before picture, of course. Aditi
didi started dieting from age twelve, and waxed her legs from age thirteen. I topped my class at age
twelve, and won the Maths Olympiad at age thirteen. Clearly, she was the cooler one. In school,
people either didnt notice me or made fun of me. I preferred the former. Hence, I stayed in the
background, with my books. Once, in class ten, a boy asked me out in front of the whole class. He
gave me a red rose along with an Archies greeting card. Overwhelmed, I cried tears of joy. Turned
out it was a prank. The entire class laughed as he squeezed the rose and ink sprayed across my face.
My spectacles protected my eyes, thankfully.
That day I realized I had only one thing going for meacademics. In class twelve I was the
school topper. I ranked among the top five in Delhi, which, come to think of it, was a major loser-like
thing to do. Unlike me, Aditi didi had barely passed class twelve a year ago. However, she did win
the unofficial title of Miss Hotness at her farewell. In some ways, oh well, in every way, that was a
bigger achievement than topping CBSE.
Have you heard about the insane cut-offs at Delhi University? I am the kind of student that
causes them. I scored a 98 per cent aggregate in class twelve. Then I joined Shri Ram College of
Commerce, or SRCC. People say it is one of the best colleges for nerds. At SRCC, I realized that I
was nerdier than even the regular nerds. I topped there too. I never bunked a class. I hardly spoke to
any boys, I made few friends. With bad school memories, I wanted to survive college with as little
human contact as possible.
I finished college and took the CAT for MBA entrance. As you can guess, nerdy me hit a 99.7
percentile. I made it to IIM Ahmedabad. In contrast, Aditi didi had finished her graduation from
Amity University the year before and wanted to get married. She had two criteria for her groom. One,
the boy had to be rich. Second, well, there was no second criterion really. She said something like
she wanted to be a housewife and look after her husband. Fortunately, rich Punjabi men in Delhi who
cant woo women on their own are only too happy to oblige girls like her. Aditi didi married Anil,
owner of three sanitaryware shops in Paharganj and two Honda CR-Vs. They had their wedding the
same year I joined IIMA.
You should also get married soon, didi had told me. Theres a right time for a girl to marry.
Dont delay it.
I am twenty-one, I said. I havent even done my masters yet.
The younger the better. Especially for someone like you, she said.
What do you mean especially for someone like me?
She never explained. I guess she meant for someone as nerdy as me or as wheatish as me or
someone whose breasts werent the size of footballs, as Punjabi men prefer.
I joined IIMA. I finally found nerd heaven. Everyone studied, and just when you thought you
had studied enough, the institute gave you more assignments. My mother called on a regular basis,
primarily to discuss her favourite topic. Start looking at boys at least. Anils circle has many good,
rich guys.
I am not going to marry a man from the circle of sanitaryware shop owners, mom.
Why? my mother said, genuinely confused.
You know what, I am not getting married for several years anyway. Forget it. I have class
now. Bye.
I finished with IIMA. Overachiever me had a job offer on Day Zero, the prime slot for
recruiters. I got an offer to be an associate at Goldman Sachs, New York. The job paid an annual
compensation of 120,000 dollars.
Forty-eight lakh rupees a year, four lakhs a month, mom, I told her on the phone.
I heard nothing in response. Most likely she had fainted. My father had never crossed a third of
this amount in his twenty-five-year career with the State Bank of India.
Are you there, mom?
How will I ever find a boy for you? she said.
That was her prime concern. Her twenty-three-year-old daughter, who grew up in middleclass
West Delhi, had cracked a job at one of the biggest investment banks in the world and all she
cared about was its impact on her groom-hunt.
Stop it, mom. What boy?
Who wants to marry a girl who earns so much? If the boy earns less, he wont consider you. If
he earns more, why would he marry a working girl?
I have no idea what you are talking about. But I am moving to America. I have a great job.
Can you save your melodrama for another time?
Your father wants to speak to you, she said and passed him the phone.
Goldman Sachs? American, no? he said.
My room phone rang, startling me back to reality. I am in Goa, not IIMA, I reminded myself.
Where are you? The Gulatis are ten minutes away, my mother said.
Huh? I am here, mom. In my room.
Are you dressed?
I looked in the mirror.
Yeah, almost.
Come down fast. What are you wearing?
The yellow salwar-kameez. Zari border.
Silk?
Yes.
You wore a chain?
Yes.
Come then.
Hey, remember me? I heard a voice behind me. I turned around.
Brijesh, I said to my husband-to-be. Hi.
I didnt know what to do next. Should I look shy? Should I giggle? Should I give him a hug?
Like an idiot, I shook hands with him while he adjusted his black-rimmed spectacles with his left
hand. Unlike how hed looked in the Skype calls of the past few weeks, he was thinner, his white
kurta and blue jeans hanging a bit on him. His neatly combed side-parted hair made him look like
those schoolboys whom teachers first ask to become prefects. I smelled strong aftershave.
I was in the lobby. The boys side had arrived. They crowded around the special check-in
desk. The hotel staff brought in trays filled with glasses of coconut water.
I made them get the coconut water. It wasnt part of the package, Suraj told me. He was
trying hard to compensate for the rooms disaster. He gave me a printout of the weeks plan. I glanced
at it.
Radhika weds Brijesh: Itinerary for the week
Day 1: Arrival, check-ins, briefing, relax in resort
Day 2: Goa Darshan Tour for elders and children (11 a.m.-6 p.m.)
Bachelor Party for Mr Brijesh Gulati at Club Cubana (8 p.m.)
Bachelorette Party for Ms Radhika Mehta at LPK (8 p.m.)
You have organized buses for the bachelor parties? I said.
Yes, maam. The buses will be there at 7.30 at the front entrance.
I read further.
Day 3: Bhajan and Puja in function room (4 p.m.)
Day 4: Mehndicounters for all ladies in function room (12-6 p.m.)
Day 5: Sangeet in function room (8 p.m.)
The choreographer is here for the sangeet practice? I said.
No, maam. He will arrive in two days. He said thats enough time for practice.
I looked at the itinerary again.
Day 6: Wedding at the Grand Ballroom and the Main Lawns (8 p.m.)
Day 7: Checkouts and departures (12 noon)
Suraj handed over the other sheets with details about each function and venue.
Sorry about the rooms goof-up, madam. Everything is under control now, he said.
Suraj had just left when Brijesh came up behind me.
This place is beautiful. Great idea to have a wedding in Goa, he said. His accent was 90 per
cent Indian and 10 per cent American. From a distance I saw my parents at the Marriott entrance,
greeting Brijeshs parents and their relatives with folded hands. I focused back on Brijesh. Thank
you. I always wanted a destination wedding, I said.
Awkward silence for ten long, slow seconds. What are we supposed to say to each other?
Should I break the ice? Should I say, hey, we can officially start having sex in a week? Shut up,
Radhika. Shut the fuck up.
You look, Brijesh paused, searching for an apt word, beautiful.
Could you do no better, Mr Groom? Stop it, Radhika, I scolded myself. Yeah, stop it,
Radhika! I have to tell you about this bad habit of mine. I have this little person, this inner mini-me
who keeps chattering about every situation or person around me. Sometimes, this mini-me
overwhelms me so much I have to think hard to remember what just happened.
Thank you, I said. Thank you, Brijesh.
And what sort of a name is Brijesh? Can it be more unfashionable? Radhika, you are going
to marry a guy called Brijesh. You will be Mrs Brijesh Gulati. Thats terrible. Okay, stop it. Stop it,
Radhika. Hes come a long way. Hes a nice guy. Thats what matters, right?
Yellow looks nice on you, Brijesh continued.
Actually, yellow sucks on me, what with my famous wheatish complexion. I wore this
because mom wanted a sunflower in the lobby when the Gulatis arrived.
Okay, he is trying.
Thanks, I said. Say more, you stupid girl. Your kurta is also nice, I said. Duh, could you be
more stupid?
Hello, beta. A man in his early fifties along with his wife came up to me. They seemed too
enthusiastic to be complete strangers. It took me a second to place them. All right, they were my inlaws.
Mr Aadarsh Gulati and Mrs Sulochana Gulati. Radhika, behave. Dont say anything stupid. Be
like mom. Be like Aditi. What would Aditi didi do? She would touch their feet. Cmon, dive, then.
I bent down. I touched the feet of people I had only Skyped twice in my life but who now
deserved my total respect. My parents had met them several times, of course. Dad told me they were
nice people. Nice people? How does anyone figure out nice people? Are there any nice people in
this world? See, my mind wont stop chattering. Ever.
How was your flight, uncle? I said.
Just one hour from Mumbai. Not like Brijesh, who has come from halfway across the world,
Aadarsh uncle said.
For you, of course, Sulochana aunty said and cupped my cheeks. She planted a big kiss on my
forehead. I guess, considering this is a country where in-laws burn brides, they did seem like nice
people.
More of Brijeshs relatives swarmed around us.
Come, come, see the dulhan, one of the aunts said. The monkey was out of the cage and there
was a free sighting in the lobby. A crowd gathered around me. I tried to remember as many names as
possible.
My mothers sisters, Rohini masi and Gunjan masi, Brijesh said, and thats dads brothers,
Purohit chacha and Amit chacha.
Bob-bob went my head as I wished them all. If I saw anyone with even a hint of white or dyed
or henna-tinted hair, I went for their feet. Exactly as my mother would expect me to. Amid the
introductions and obsequious respect going on, Brijesh pulled me aside.
Hey, is this too much for you?
I shrugged.
Is there somewhere we could take a walk? he said.
There, he was being sweet. I had told him earlier I wanted to get to know him better, and he
was making an effort.
Sure. Lets go to the poolside, I said.
P
2
alm trees along the Marriott pool swayed green in the breeze. The 5 p.m. December sun lit up
the hotels cottages, casting gentle shadows everywhere. We went down the walking path, with
the hotel to our left and the Arabian Sea to our right. I felt overdressed in my sunflower outfit as other
hotel guests roamed around in shorts and vests.
So you just arrived yesterday from San Francisco? I said.
Yeah, landed last night, he said. I wanted to maximize my leave. One week for the wedding.
A couple of days after that at home in Mumbai. Then Bali for our honeymoon. Used it all up, actually.
The word honeymoon caused a jolt in me. Mini-me woke up again.
Honeymoon! After a dozen-odd Skype calls and meeting once over a day trip? A week in
Bali with this man I am walking next to. Will we be naked? Stop it, Radhika. Focus on the moment.
Must be tiring, flying so much, I said.
I saw you. Not tired anymore.
I smiled. The man is trying. Maybe I should too.
Brijesh smiled back. He had innocent teachers-pet eyes. Hows Facebook? I said.
I had a busy month. Just finished an enterprise project. So much work, front-end interfaces,
back-end systems, underlying APIs.
APIs?
Application programme interface. Set of routines, protocols and tools for building software
applications. How software components interact, basically.
I nodded, having understood not a word.
You have no idea what I am talking about, right?
I laughed.
I know. Not the most exciting job in the world, he said, his voice flat.
Come on, you work at Facebook. Its quite cool.
People think it is Facebook so theres nothing to do. We post pictures all day or something.
I am sure it is pretty high-tech behind the scenes.
Should I talk about more personal stuff? He will happily discuss computer code for two
hours if I let him. Radhika, take control.
You like your job? I said.
Brijesh shrugged. Its nice. A lot of smart people. Always stuff happening. Pays well. Stock
options. Flexi time. . .
What about that start-up idea? I said. He had mentioned setting up his own software company
when wed met earlier.
Thats there. I still want to do it, Brijesh said.
So then?
Facebook is hard to leave. The salary, stock options and benefits. Plus, I would need funding.
Arranging all that, leaving that level of security takes a lot. Just simpler this way.
I nodded. We had to talk beyond work. Fortunately, he switched topics.
I love Goa, he said. I am here after a decade. We came here from our engineering college.
Of course, not to such fancy resorts. We stayed in a simple place. Ate at the shacks.
I love the shacks.
You will love San Francisco too, he said.
I have lived in New York. Never on the West Coast.
California is different from New York. More laid-back.
Even our group at Goldman is supposed to be more chilled out in San Francisco.
Hows that coming along? Your transfer done?
My phone buzzed twice.
Sorry, phone. Maybe mom needs something, I said.
Sure, Brijesh said.
I had two messages from an unknown number. The number started with +1. Someone in the
USA, I figured.
Hey, heard you are getting married. True? said the first message.
This is Debu, by the way. Hope you remember me, said the second.
Debu? Debashish Sen! After what, like, three years? Debu was messaging me?
Hi, I typed back. He replied immediately.
Hi, Radhika. How are you? Took me a while to hunt for your number. Been wanting to talk to
you.
Everything okay? Brijesh said, noticing how preoccupied I was with my phone.
Huh? Yeah, all good, I said, my voice nervous. I lowered the phone and clenched it in my
hand.
So, all done? Brijesh said.
What?
Your transfer. We were just talking about it.
Huh? Yes, yes. Its done, mostly. I will have to shuttle between London and San Francisco a
few times, for my existing investments. But it is done.
My phone buzzed three more times, vibrating in my hand. I should have ignored it. However,
there is something about buzzing phonesmy obsessive-compulsive disorder makes me look at them.
After all, it could be mom or Aditi didi. It wasnt.
Hey baby. I just want to say I am sorry, Debus message said. He continued:
I found out you are getting married.
I couldnt believe it.
I had to reply to this.
Why? You didnt think anyone would? I typed back.
Having reached the end of the garden, Brijesh and I turned around to stroll back.
We have to find a place to stay. Facebook is in Menlo Park, Goldman Sachs is downtown,
right? Brijesh said.
Huh? What is downtown? I said, my mind still on Debus message.
Goldman Sachs. San Francisco office, Brijesh said, each word slow and deliberate. After
all, he was speaking to a distracted idiot like me.
Yeah, Goldman is on California Street, downtown.
My phone buzzed a few more times. I swore to myself not to check it. I focused on Brijesh.
So we have to decide whether well stay downtown or near Menlo Park, which is in Palo
Alto, Brijesh said.
Yeah, sure.
Sure what?
You are right. I had no idea what he just said.
I said you have to choose. Downtown or Palo Alto?
Why do I have to choose?
Radhika, are you okay? I said, we have to choose where well stay.
I finally figured out the conversation.
Uh-oh. Well, I am easy, actually. You are already staying in Menlo Park, right?
Yeah, but my lease expires in two months.
Just one little peek, I told myself. I will have a quick look at the phone and then pay full
attention to Brijesh.
I lifted the phone. Among the many messages from Debu, one read: I love you.
Fuck. Fortunately, I did not blurt the word out. I immediately shut the phone. I placed my hand
on my face.
I was keen to move out anyway, Brijesh said. Radhika, are you okay? Everything under
control?
Actually, I need to go back. Mom needs something. Jewellery issues, I said.
Ah. Indian weddings, Brijesh said.
Yeah, I had lied to my husband-to-be, within one hour of his arrival. What a wonderful bride I
am going to make, isnt it? See, I told you, you wont like me very much.
So I will see you again soon? I said.
Of course, Brijesh said, with a twinkle in his eye. I am going to be your husband, you are
going to see me all the time. Come, lets walk back.
I gripped my phone tight as if otherwise the messages would leak out and fall on the floor.
Brijesh left me at the lift lobby, where he met one of his cousins who wanted to talk to him. The lift
door shut. I pressed the button to the fourth floor, and took a deep breath. I checked my phone. It had
tons of messages from Debu.
For the past few months I have been thinking of you constantly.
Only had the courage to text you now.
I made the biggest mistake. I didnt value you.
I love you.
What the hell is he talking about?
Ting! The lift reached my floor. I walked up to my room and rang the bell. Aditi didi opened
the door.
Where were you? She gave me a mischievous look. With Brijesh?
I smiled, as if caught red-handed. I am the coy bride. I have to smile whenever my would-behusband
is mentioned.
Didi had opened one of her suitcases. It was the kind of giant bag murderers use to hide
bodies. She had six dresses spread out on the bed.
What is Brijesh like? she said, as she unfolded a red dress.
Decent. Getting to know him, I said, plonking myself on the sofa. I took out my phone again.
Why? Why am I taking out my phone again?
Aditi didi continued to talk. I didnt know Anil at all before marriage. You just get to know
each other better after the wedding. The honeymoon helps. She winked at me.
I nodded, even as I wondered what to reply to Debu.
I really do, Debu texted again. The guy who earlier took ten days to reply to a text was now
sending ten texts a minute.
Are you high? I replied. Debu and I ended up having a chat.
No. It is 5 in the morning here. I am having my coffee. This is not a drunk text.
Good. Then you need to know I am getting married in five days.
What? So soon?
Yes. Guests are already here.
Whom are you getting married to?
Someone not as insecure as you. . . I typed and deleted.
Brijesh Gulati. . . I typed and deleted again.
I decided to not reply. Didi held up two dresses, one blue and one red.
Which one should I wear for tomorrows bachelorette? Honest opinion, she said.
Both are good. Which is your favourite? I said.
I like the red. But its really short. Is it screaming for attention too much? she said.
Of course, it is. But thats what you have always wanted, sister. Why stop yourself now?
Its fine. Wear whatever you like, I said.
Ill wear the blue. Its to the knees. More elder-sister-of-the-bride types.
You are only a year older.
Yeah, that is also true. And tomorrow is the only day I get to wear a Western dress. I only
wear Indian after that. I am one of the few girls here who can actually carry off a dress like this.
She lifted her red dress. Yes, Aditi didi with her super-slim soup-and-salad-diet figure could
carry it off.
Red, didi. End of debate, I said.
My phone buzzed.
Babes, who are you getting married to? Debu said.
I replied, It doesnt matter. You are not in my life anymore, Debashish.
Can you call me Debu at least?
I am busy, Debashish. I dont have time for this.
Wheres the wedding?
I didnt respond.
You didnt invite me? he said, needling me again.
Asshole, you didnt even return my calls, I wanted to say but didnt.
My phone rang. Debu was trying to call me. I cut the call. I typed back a message.
Dont call me. I told you I am busy. There are people around.
So just reply to me. Where is the wedding?
Why?
Just curious.
Whatever, I typed back.
I can call friends around and find out. So why dont you just tell me?
Goa.
Wow! Destination wedding and all.
I didnt respond. To distract myself I asked Aditi didi a deep existential question: What shoes
are you wearing with this?
Oh see, now thats an issue too. I have these four-inch-heel red stilettos, but thats definitely
attention-seeking.
Yeah, plus we are going dancing. Would be difficult in high heels. I am wearing flats.
My sister feels her deepest bond with me when I discuss clothes and shoes with her. She came
up to me and pulled my cheeks. You cant wear flats for your bachelorette. How cute you are. You
dont know anything.
Yes, I may be a distressed debt specialist. I may have rescued bankrupt companies and
structured complex takeovers. I may be a vice president at Goldman Sachs. But if I prefer flats
because they are comfortable, I know nothing. I had kept a black dress for tomorrows party. Didi had
a look at it. Too simple, she said. She went on to accessorize it for me. As she opened her jewellery
box, I checked my phone again.
Where in Goa? Debu had sent me a message.
Why? I said.
Can I call, please? he said.
No.
Its at a resort? he said.
Debu, you are in New York. Focus on your work there. Didnt you have a girlfriend?
Who?
Never mind.
I am sorry, Rad.
Its okay. Life goes on. It has gone on.
Yeah, true. But I made the biggest mistake. And you are getting married now. Like now!
I sent a smiley back.
Where will you live after your marriage? Hong Kong?
No. I moved to London from Hong Kong a year ago.
Oh. So London?
San Francisco.
Ah. IT guy?
I have to go, Debashish.
Still mad at me?
No. I really have to go. I have to get ready for dinner with the guests.
Okay. I am just asking casually. Where is the wedding?
Marriott, I said.
Nice! Must be beautiful.
Stop chatting on your phone. Who are you talking to anyway? Everyone we know is here in
Goa for the wedding, Aditi didi said.
Huh? Nobody. Just. . .work, I said, keeping my phone aside. After the bridegroom, the bride
had lied to her sister.
Take this, my body necklace. Your dull dress will liven up, she said.
My dull dress is Prada, didi, I said.
I dont care. It needs to have a get-up, no? It is too sober. You are too sober.
I didnt think I was going to remain sober. Not after Debus next message.
I am coming, he said.
What? I typed back, mouth open.
I am coming to India. Let me check flights.
Are you nuts?
No, really, I want to talk to you.
Debu, calm down, okay? This is not funny.
At least you called me Debu again.
Whatever. I have to go. Please dont message.
See you soon. Bye.
Go to work. Bye.
Again you are lost in your phone. What is wrong with you? Aditi didi said.
I looked up as I re-entered the real world.
Everyones meeting for dinner soon. Get ready.
Cant I go like this? I just wore this.
No. You are the bride.
So? I have to change every two hours?
Just go shower, okay? And dont take your phone inside.
D
3
idi, lets go, the bus is waiting, I said. Aditi didi had spent the last two hours changing in and
out of a dozen dresses. Finally, she wore the red one shed always wanted to wear.
Is it showing too much cleavage? she said.
Isnt that what you want? I am the bride, goddammit. It is my bachelorette party. Cant you
make me the priority at least for this week?
The room phone rang. I picked it up.
Hey, Brijesh said. I had started to recognize his voice. Thats a good sign, isnt it?
Hi, Brijesh. All set?
Yeah, my gang is on the bus. I am calling from the reception.
Oh, you boys go ahead. The driver knows Club Cubana, right? I said.
Yeah, he does, it is in Arpora. Your bus for LPK is here too. Coming?
Soon.
I wish we were going to the same place, Brijesh said.
I laughed. Thats sweet, Brijesh, but thats the point of a bachelor party. Your last night out
without the annoying spouse. Boys and girls go separately tonight.
You are not annoying, he said.
Clearly you dont know me yet.
I wanted to see you before we left. My gang wanted to see all the dressed-up Mehta girls.
Your gang is not laying an eye on my innocent cousins.
I ended the call and turned to Aditi didi, who continued to adjust her dress in front of the
mirror. Didi, you do realize it is my bachelorette?
There it is, said Jyoti, my second cousin, pointing at a huge flaming-yellow lit-up sign for Love
Passion Karma or LPK. The club, half an hour from the hotel, was located at the waterfront of Nerul
River and decorated in an over-the-top Paleolithic era theme, with stone caves and giant stone statues
of the early man on the lawn. We were a group of fifteen girls. Suraj had also arranged two bouncers
for us. We had a table in a semi-private area, with balloons and champagne bottles.
Nice job, Suraj, I thought.
Some of the girls seem too young, madam, the club owner told Aditi didi.
Everyone is above eighteen, didi said firmly.
Some people in your group do look underage, maam, he said.
Its okay. Give them soft drinks. But get my sister drunk tonight.
No, didi, I said in vain as the owner brought a round of tequila shots. I had to take two. Jyoti
asked for another round. Rajni, our neighbours daughter, wanted the music louder. Shruti, my
childhood friend from school, wanted Honey Singh songs. Saloni, Aditi didis best friend, felt we
should play drinking games until someone puked. There is nothing as crazy as fifteen Punjabi girls
determined to go out of control. I took out my phone. I had a message from Brijesh.
Club Cubana is nice. Thanks.
You are welcome. How is it going? I said.
Three drinks down. And you?
Was made to consume tequila shots.
Wow. Wait, the boys are teasing me for chatting with you.
Ha ha, go have fun. I kept my phone aside.
Aditi didi wanted to raise a toast. Two waiters arrived and poured champagne for everyone.
For my only darling sweetest sister. Someone who only studied and worked hard. She did
nothing naughty in life. Nothing bad ever.
Yeah right, I thought but simply smiled as Aditi didi continued, Oh yes, shes the good girl. If
I barely passed, she topped. If I became a housewife, she became a hi-fi banker. If I had the boobs,
she had the brains.
All the girls laughed. The muscular bouncers blushed. My phone buzzed. Must be Brijesh, I
thought. Hes sweet. Hes trying to make a connection.
Hey, am at JFK airport. Figuring out last-minute tickets, Debu had messaged instead.
What? I typed back.
Fifteen hours to Mumbai. Then a quick connection to Goa.
Debu, are you serious? Stop it, will you?
Aditi didi caught me staring at my phone.
Look at my baby, chatting with her husband-to-be. At least leave him on your girls night out,
she said. Everyone laughed. Aditi didi took a big gulp of the champagne. I gulped at what I saw next.
Debu had sent me a picture of the Air India counter at JFK. He followed it up with a smiley.
Take another shot, one of my cousins egged me.
Yeah, just shoot me instead.
Miss you, said another message.
Will you shut the fuck up and go home? I typed in response. Damn, I almost pressed send
before I realized the last miss you message had come from Brijesh.
I deleted what I had written and retyped, Aww, sweet, adding a few smileys. I couldnt think
of anything more imaginative. With care I switched chats from Brijesh to Debu.
Please dont bother me. Go home, I said.
Girls, my sister made an announcement, what say we take away the brides phone for the
evening?
Huh? No, didi, no, I said in vain as Aditi didi snatched my phone from my hands and placed
it in her handbag.
Its your last night out as a bachelorette. You better do crazy things and not waste it on the
phone, Aditi didi said.
I wanted to tell her I had enough craziness happening on the phone.
Okay, Aditi didi announced. Lets play challenge the bride. Everyone will give the bride
a dare. And Radhika has to do it.
I looked around. Our table was in one corner of the restaurant. In the middle, several people
sat on bar stools. Half the customers were Indians who had come to Goa for the Christmas holidays.
Others were mostly European and American tourists.
Jyoti gave me the first task.
See that bald white guy over there. She pointed at a forty-something man sitting at the bar.
Find out his name and the country he comes from.
Thats too easy, didi said.
Get his name, country and slap, no wait, kiss his forehead, said Shruti.
Everyone laughed and cheered at the suggestion.
No way, I said.
Yes way. Here take this. Bottoms up. Saloni gave me a half-filled champagne glass. I gulped
it in one go. My head felt light.
Go! Aditi didi clapped her hands.
I walked up to the bar.
Hi there, I said to the man. He wore a white vest and jeans. He had two rings on his right
hand and a dragon tattoo on his right shoulder.
Hi there, young lady, he said. His accent sounded Australian. I had to confirm it.
Are you an Australian cricketer?
He laughed. No, mate, I am Australian but I am no cricket player. Like watching it, though.
Arent you Philip Lee? I made up a name on the spot.
Is he even a player? he said and sipped his beer.
You arent Philip?
No, he said. Can I buy you a drink, young lady?
Well, who are you then?
Im Mark. What drink would you like?
A tequila shot.
Mark ordered a pair of shots. I had accomplished two out of the three tasks.
Cheers, he said as we took the shot.
I put the glass on the table.
You here on holiday? Mark said.
Actually, I am here to get married.
Really?
Yeah. I have to go. Bye, Mark.
Before he could react I kissed his head.
Thanks for the drink, I said and scooted out of there.
The girls gave me a standing ovation. Everyone had a shot as a mark of respect for my
courage.
Okay, no more, I said as Mark winked at me from the bar.
The girls were hysterical. We finished four champagne bottles. We ordered four more. I dont
really know when we started to dance. The DJ played tracks like Subah hone na de and Baby doll.
Some men in the club tried to flirt with my little cousins. Aditi didi shooed most of them off. We had
selfie binges as the fifteen of us took photos in every possible permutation and combination. An hour
later, another group of boys arrived at the club. It took us girls a minute to realize the situation.
Oh my God. Its Brijesh jiju and his gang! Saloni said.
Brijesh came up to me on the dance floor.
Not allowed, not allowed, Jyoti said.
You were at Club Cubana. What happened? Shruti said to Akhil, Brijeshs maternal cousin.
Nothing. We had a few drinks. Then we thought, when we have the most beautiful girls in Goa
partying alone, what are we doing here? Akhil said.
Shruti blushed. Even though the girls protested at the boys coming here, they secretly liked it.
This is how we girls are. At times we want to be wanted, even when we deny it. My bachelorette
wasnt really a singles party now. However, I was too drunk to care.
You look too beautiful, Brijesh said. The DJ switched to Honey Singhs Blue eyes, a slow
couples-only type song, possibly to get drunk single men off the floor.
Obviously you have had too much to drink, I said. Nobody could find me too beautiful
otherwise.
Well, I have had a few. But I always find you really beautiful, Brijesh said.
Sweet, I thought. The tequila in me gave him a hug.
I messaged you, Brijesh said, several times.
You did? Oh, wheres my phone? I dont even know where my phone is.
I wanted to check if you would be okay if we come. I tried to stop the boys.
Its okay. The idea is to have fun. All this segregation is not to be taken seriously, I said.
Nice music, he said.
You want to dance? I said.
I am not much of a dancer, Brijesh said.
Neither am I, I said.
I held his shoulders as we swayed gently to Blue eyes. The girls went into an aww and how
sweet overdrive.
See, I can be a good girl. Am I not trying to be a good girl? I told mini-me, my personal
chatterbox and eternal critic. Mini-me, however, had slept off. Alcohol does this to her. I guess that is
why most people drink anyway. To shut up their inner critic. So they can do whatever the hell they
want.
Ouch, Brijesh, you are stepping on my toes, I said.
I
4
t was 4 in the afternoon. Everyone whod partied last night had a hangover. We had come back to
the hotel at 6 in the morning and gone straight for breakfast. I remembered sitting with my mother
and ordering pancakes. I couldnt eat much, as I kept dozing off.
Wake up. This is so wrong, what you did. Brijeshs parents will think what an uncultured and
irresponsible girl they are getting. Who drinks like this? my mother had said, shaking me non-stop.
Even their son did. In fact, he puked and passed out at the club, Id said.
Hes a boy.
Even in my exhausted, hungover and sleepy state, my feminist antennae were up. I stared at my
mother.
So what if he is a boy? I said. Clearly, the alcohol-induced confidence had not left me.
Eat quickly. Get some rest. There are bhajans today. Please wear something decent. Why do
you youngsters have to do such parties the night before bhajans?
Why do you oldies have to do bhajans the day after our party?
Just because you have started to make money you will say anything?
I had kept quiet. I didnt mention that this uncultured and irresponsible daughter of theirs was
paying for her own wedding. One crore rupees, or 150,000 dollars, wired from my salary account as
the wedding budget. Did she even care?
I had had to gulp down a glass of orange juice to calm myself. You have screwed up your life
enough, can you please behave for a few days? the voice inside told me. Ah, good morning, minime.
When did you wake up?
I remembered being escorted to my room. Aditi didi slept diagonally across the bed, still in
her red dress. I changed into my T-shirt and pajamas, slid didis legs aside and lay down. My head
hurt like someone had hammered it a few times. I closed my eyes.
Didi woke me up at 2.30 in the afternoon.
Get up, we have bhajans.
They are at 4. Why are you waking me up now? I said. Didi drew open the curtains. My eyes
hurt from the daylight.
You need time to get ready. Here, you have to wear this orange saree.
No, I said and pulled a pillow on top of my head.
I woke up eventually. I grumbled about the entire process of dressing up, which only women
have to endure. The hotel sent a hair-and-make-up lady to our room. She blow-dried my tangled hair.
The noise from the hair-dryer hurt my head even more.
We reached the function room downstairs. It had been converted to look like the inside of a
temple. Marigold flowers in parabolic shapes adorned the walls. At the centre was a huge picture of
Sai Baba. My parents believed in him more than any God. Statues of other Hindu godsKrishna,
Ganesha, Lakshmi and Vaishno Deviwere also kept. The bhajan singers set up their mikes.
The younger lot sat at the back of the room. Most of them were holding their heads. Brijeshs
friends and cousins wore crisp silk kurta-pajamas. They had taken a shower in order to look fresh.
They passed around strips of Combiflam and bottles of water to nurse their hangovers.
My girls did no better. Most of them leaned back against the wall and snoozed in their
elaborate lehengas and salwar-kameezes. The way Indian girls transform themselves from party
chicks in short dresses to fully clad, chaste, virginal bhajan attendees is almost a visual effects
miracle. The bhajans began. The singers had wonderful voices. However, when you are hungover even
the best melody sounds like an electric drill. Brijesh looked at me and smiled. I gestured that I wanted
to sleep. He passed me a Combiflam strip. I popped a pill.
You are not well? Kamla bua said.
Just tired, I said.
I have an Ayurvedic medicine. It works better, Kamla bua said. Nothing in the world works
better than Combiflam, I wanted to tell her.
Nice bhajans, bua, I said instead.
The angels of Marriott brought us cups of black coffee. I had two. I swore not to drink again,
ever. Okay, at least not this week. The coffee helped me wake up somewhat.
Come and pray in front, beta, one of my aunts told me.
Brijesh and I went ahead and bowed before the gods. The singers sang a special song for us. I
looked at Brijesh. He had his eyes shut and hands folded. He was actually praying. I felt guilty for not
praying with as much sincerity. Because you are a fraud, mini-me told me. Will you ever shut up? I
said to mini-me.
I went back and sat with the girls. Brijesh joined the boys. The crowd participated in the next
bhajan, one of the more popular ones. Despite the loud music, I found it hard to keep my eyes open.
However, I woke up with a jolt when a bearded man in his late twenties entered the room. He had
curly hair and wore a white kurta-pajama.
Oh God. Debu? I blurted out.
What? Rajni, who sat next to me, said.
Nothing, I said.
He went up to the Sai Baba picture with confidence. He knelt down, bowed and touched his
forehead to the ground. Done with his prayers, he went to the mens section and sat down. He clapped
his hands as the singers sang the next bhajan.
What the fuck is he doing here? Did I just say, or think, the F-word in the puja room? Who
cares? Am I imagining this? No I am not. What the fuck is Debu doing here?
He looked at me and smiled. Brijesh smiled at me at the same time as well. I fake-smiled at
both of them. I had to talk to Debu. How? Where is my phone? Damn, where is my phone?
Where is my phone? Havent seen it today. Did I leave it in the club? I whispered to Rajni.
Aditi didi kept it last night, right?
I tapped Aditi didis shoulder. She sat in front of me, wearing a magenta salwar-kameez with
the dupatta covering her head. She sang with full fervour. Nobody could have guessed how well she
had matched every step of Sunny Leones Baby doll at LPK last night.
What? she said. I gestured that she return my phone. She rummaged through her handbag.
Here, she said and handed it to me.
I had only 5 per cent battery left. I checked my messages. Brijesh had sent me some about
leaving Club Cubana and coming to LPK. Debu had sent messages about taking off, and then one
about him having landed in Goa.
What on earth are you doing here? I messaged Debu.
He didnt see his phone. He seemed to be in bliss, lost in the bhajans. Fuck, what is wrong
with him? It took me a minute to get his attention. I gestured to him to look at his phone.
He saw the message. He replied with a few wink smileys from across the room.
Really, what are you doing? I typed back.
Nice surprise, no? he messaged.
Cut the nonsense, Debu. My entire family is here.
Yeah, I saw. His too. I saw the groom. Golden silk kurta, lots of red threads around his wrist,
right?
What do you want, Debu? I sent a message.
To talk face-to-face.
I cant.
I have come all the way. Please.
My phone is dying.
Meet me.
How? I said.
You say. Anytime. Anywhere.
I thought hard.
After the bhajans. At the hotel gym.
Nobody would go to the gym after bhajans. He replied with a thumbs up.
Debu sat on the bench press. He held a dumbbell in one hand and did bicep curls. I stood in front of
him.
Are you crazy? I said. I looked around to see if anyone I knew had come to the gym. Apart
from one old white man on the treadmill and a gym trainer, there was no one.
Thank you for coming, he said. By the way, you look gorgeous in this orange sari. Wow. Just
wow!
Whatever. And can you keep that dumbbell down?
Just trying to make it look natural, he said.
You are in a kurta. I am in a saree. We dont look natural here. Debu, what is wrong with you?
You literally took a flight and came down?
Yeah. I am quite jetlagged actually. I feel like having breakfast. Want to grab some?
Will you stop it? You have no idea how I have come here. Everyone will be looking for me at
dinner.
We can go there. I can eat.
Debu, this is not a joke. My family is here. Their reputation is important. How could you just
walk into the bhajans place?
I wanted to pray. For my mission to be successful.
What mission?
To win you back. The most important thing in the world for me right now.
I must say, for a second I had no answer. I looked at him. He still had his trademark two-week
beard and curly hair. He had gained a bit of weight, but also become more fit. Or maybe it just felt
like that in the gym.
How are you, baby? he said.
Dont baby me, I said, loud enough for the American man on the treadmill to turn his head
towards us for a second. I continued, You have any idea what you made me go through? And you just
cut me off.
I was an idiot. An insecure twenty-four-year-old.
And what are you now? A stupid twenty-eight-year-old?
Maybe. But I am old enough to realize you are the best thing to have ever happened to me.
What? I said, then keeping my composure, Its over, Debu. Its been over since long back.
You didnt even return my calls.
I am sorry.
It doesnt matter. Now I have to ask you to leave. Go visit your parents in Kolkata. You are in
India anyway.
New York, baby.
What about New York?
Dont you remember the days in New York? We had issues, yes, but how can you forget all
the happy memories?
He looked into my eyes. He seemed to be in pain. For the first time in my life, someone had
crossed half a planet to come for the usually unlovable me. And it is hard to keep yelling at someone
who has done that for you.
You forgot, baby? he said again.
No, Debu, I have forgotten nothing, I said, my voice soft.
New York

ay-gulls. Thats how you pronounce them, spelt b-a-g-e-l-s, Avinash said at the breakfast
counter on 85 Broad Street, worldwide headquarters of Goldman Sachs.
Avinash, a batchmate of mine from IIMA, had also made it to Goldman Sachs. He had worked
abroad before his MBA. He knew a lot more than me about the way things worked in America. He
picked up the doughnut-shaped bread, slit it horizontally with a black plastic knife and smeared it
with cheese.
Bagel and cream cheese, classic combo, he said.
Thanks, Avinash, I said, fumbling with my plate, my handbag, my umbrella and my senses. I
had worn a Western-style office suit for the first time in my life. Even for my Goldman Sachs
interview at IIMA campus I had worn a saree.
Is the skirt too tight? Is my ass looking too big? Is my hair in place? Mini-me was in
overdrive, the perfect day for her to knock me out.
Two hundred other fresh recruits had arrived from all over the world. For our ten-week
associate training, we had to report at 7.30 in the morning. Classes began after a quick breakfast, and
ended at 6.30 in the evening.
Partners and senior employees from various departments, such as Corporate Finance, Equities
and Distressed Debt, took sessions on what actually happened in their group. The partners, no more
than 200 in the entire firm of 20,000 people, held the senior-most positions in the firm. They held
equity in the bank and made the most money. Their annual compensation could reach tens of millions
of dollars every year.
Open the Goldman Sachs business principles, said Gary Colbert, a senior partner who
looked like a rich grandfather in his gold spectacles. Goldman took great pride in its fourteen
business principles.
Long-term greed, Gary said. Read that line in the principles. Thats what we aim for here.
Greed and investment banking went together. Goldman was honest enough to admit it. They
just didnt mind delaying their greed, for it made the pay-off even better. Gary recounted his journey
from joining Goldman as an operations assistant thirty-five years ago.
Everyone works hard at Goldman, no exception. If you want an easy life, look elsewhere,
Gary said. Well, it was too late for me to look elsewhere. I was already in New York. Trainees
circulated horror stories about new associates spending nights in the office and sleeping on office
couches. Two weeks into our training Avinash came up to me.
I have a group of Indian friends in New York. We are meeting up for drinks tonight. You want
to come?
I have to finish the merger model spreadsheet, I said.
You are still a muggu, Avinash said, referring to me as someone who mugs up, or studies, all
the time. My IIMA reputation would not leave me so easily.
I had lied to Avinash. I had a haircut appointment. After moving to New York, I had decided to
leave my nerdy, unfashionable days far behind. An associate trainee in my class had gorgeous
shoulder-length hair with waves, exactly how I wanted mine. She had made a booking for me at a
salon on 32nd Street.
Of course, I couldnt tell Avinash this. Muggu Radhika doing her hair? He would laugh in my
face. The news would spread like wildfire in the IIMA alumni groups.
You are in New York, will you live a little? Avinash said.
Where are the drinks? I said.
At Whiskey Blue. Its a bar at the W Hotel. Right opposite the Benjamin Hotel, where you are
staying. Some problems in the world seem to exist solely for women. Like not having anything to wear.
I realized I had nothing nice for tonight.
I am not sure, let me see, I said.
What let me see? Just come, Muggu, he said.
For the rare breed of girls like me that hates shopping and has serious retardation in the areas of the
brain that help you pick a dress, Banana Republic is the answer.
Hi, miss. God, you have a gorgeous colour, one of the African-American female sales
assistants said. Say that to my mother. She stays up at night wondering who will marry me with this
skin colour.
I have to go for drinks, with some friends, I said, and I suck at shopping. Can you help?
When you have no clue, best to surrender. The only shopping I ever did in my life was for
textbooks.
Ill take care of you, girl, the shop assistant said.
She picked a navy-blue lace dress for me. It fit well, but ended mid-thigh.
Too short? I said.
Not at all. Its summer. You look lovely, she said. Even though she was paid to say it, it felt
good. I would wax those legs, though, she added.
Ouch! That hurt.
Unless you like it natural, the salesperson corrected herself, switching back to classic
American political correctness.
I entered Whiskey Blue at 9. The plush bar and lounge had decadent leather sofas and dim lighting.
Avinash noticed me first.
Hey, you are late, he said, and wow.
What?
Your dress. I almost didnt recognize you.
Was that an oh my God, you look good wow? Or was it a what the fuck are you wearing
wow? Before I could ask he introduced me to the others.
Thats Ruchi, Ashish, Nidhi, Rohan and our dreamer-philosopher, Debu, Avinash said, and
this is Radhika, guys, my batchmate from IIMA, top mugger and now at Goldman Sachs, like me.
Fuck you, Avinash.
She doesnt look like a mugger, Debu said. He shifted to make space for me.
We occupied two sofas. Ruchi, Ashish and Nidhi sat on one. Rohan, Avinash, Debu and I sat
on the opposite side. The waiter asked for my order.
I dont really drink a lot, I said.
Dont worry, they only give you one glass at a time, Debu said. I smiled.
He looked into my eyes. He did have a philosopher look about him, with his beard and
uncombed hair.
Wine? he said. Its light.
Sure, I said.
A glass of Shiraz for the lady, Debu said to the waiter. Nobody had ever ordered Shiraz for
me, which I later learnt is a type of grape. Nobody had ever referred to me as a lady either.
Cheers, Debu said once our drinks arrived.
Everyone lifted his or her glasses. Debu continued, To the fresh-off-the-boat people, Avinash,
Rohan and Radhika. Welcome to the USA, welcome to New York.
I learnt more about the others. Rohan had come from IIMC. He had a job at Morgan Stanley.
Nidhi and Ashish were dating each other. They had worked at Merrill Lynch for two years.
At one point, when the others were lost in conversation, Debu turned to me.
Goldman Sachs, eh? Thats a big deal. What is it like? Debu said.
Its okay, I said. I am still in training. Most of it is going over my head. How about you? Are
you in a bank too?
Debu laughed. Far from it. I am not a numbers guy at all. I work in BBDO. An advertising
agency on Madison Avenue.
That is so cool, I said.
The only somewhat creative career I could find.
Where are you from? I said.
I grew up in Kolkata. Then went to SRCC in Delhi, then did my masters here. . .
I cut him mid-sentence.
SRCC? You went to SRCC? Which batch?
I graduated three years ago, he said.
What? You are one batch senior to me.
We realized that despite attending the same college we had never seen or met each other.
Sorry, I cant recall seeing you, I said.
I was under the influence. Justifying the use of grass to stimulate my creativity. So I dont
blame you.
I studied most of the time. I dont blame you, I said. Both of us laughed. A little bit of wine
from my glass spilt on my leg. He offered me a tissue. Even in the darkness, I noticed him look at my
legs.
Oh, so this is how guys check out girls? Thank God it is dark. I need to book a waxing
appointment soon.
Where are you staying? Debu said.
Right across, at the Benjamin Hotel. Only for training, though. Will look for an apartment
soon.
He lit up a cigarette. He offered me one. I declined.
Can I say something? he said.
Sure, I said.
That is a nice dress you are wearing, he said.
Oh, thanks, I said. The mix of compliments and wine made me giddy.
But if you want me to cut the price tag, I can. Sixty-nine ninety-five. Good buy, he said. He
pointed to the tag, still attached to the back of my dress.
My face colour changed to match that of the red wine. I had never been so embarrassed in my
life.
Or I can let it be if you want to return the dress. The return policy is great in the USA, Debu
said.
I fumbled to find the price label on my back. He laughed, picked up a cutlery knife from the
table and cut the tag.
Whats up, guys? Avinash asked as he noticed Debu bent over my back.
Nothing. I liked the dress. Just wanted to check the brand, Debu said.
You advertising types, always curious, Avinash said.
Post-drinks the group decided to go to Rays, a famous place for pizzas.
Whats your favourite cuisine? Debu asked me as he ate his pizza slice.
I had no favourite cuisine. I couldnt say Indian. It sounded too unfashionable.
Chinese, I blurted out.
I know a great Chinese place. Would you like to go sometime?
Did he just ask me out? Nobody has ever asked me out. Thank you, Banana Republic. Oh,
maybe he is just being helpful. He is saying he will tell me of a Chinese place I can go to
sometime, alone. Is that what he means?
He looked at me, waiting for an answer. Say something, Radhika.
Huh? Yeah, why not? You can tell me the address, or if they deliver. . .
I meant with me.
Oh, I said and became quiet. Say something else, you stupid girl.
Yeah. Just you and me, Debu said.
My heart began to beat fast. Is this what people call a date? Can I ask him to clarify?
Okay, I said, letting out a huge breath, we can.
Next Friday? he said. Thoughts darted across my head. Isnt he too forward? Wait, he is just
fixing a time. Else how will it ever happen? Will it look too cheap and desperate if I say yes? Will
he think I am a slut? Why is there no user manual for how girls should live on this planet?
Friday? I said and shut up, like a bimbette. He must be wondering how Goldman ever hired
me.
Yeah. Weekend. No office next day, he said, his voice uncomfortable. He didnt know if I
was trying to blow him off or just being the usual idiot that I am.
Okay, I said. The effort it took me to say that okay felt like lifting seven heavy suitcases.
Cool. I will message you the time and address.
Sure, I said.
Only if I have your number, he said.
Oh, of course. Ill give it to you, I said.

istressed Debt: Special Situations Group, the slide on the projection system read. The
associate training class became radio silent. Distressed Debt was the hardest group to crack and join
in Goldman Sachs. In any year only one or two associates were offered a role in the group. Those
who made it earned the fastest promotions and the best bonuses.
Everyone had waited for this presentation.
Good morning, everyone, said the speaker on stage in a British accent. I am Neel Gupta,
partner at the Special Situations Group in the Hong Kong office.
I looked up from my desk. He was six feet tall, lean and had a muscular frame. He had high
cheekbones and a light brown complexion. He had salt-and-pepper hair, more pepper than salt,
actually. He wore a crisp white shirt, a pinstriped navy-blue suit and a matching tie.
I will be giving you an overview of the Distressed Debt Group, in my view the most exciting
place to be in Goldman Sachs.
I sat next to four American girls: Maggie, Angela, Jessica and Carolyn. They looked at each
other and made he-is-so-hot gestures.
If he wasnt a partner he could be a model in one of those ads that show distinguished men
buying expensive watches.
He is gorgeous, a girl behind me whispered.
Focus, Radhika, I told myself as he switched to the next slide.
The slide showed various stages in the life of a business. It started with the inception and
start-up stage. It went on to growth, maturity, decline and demise.
Angel funds, venture capital and private equity. These guys help companies that are just born
or are growing up. In clinical terms you can call them the maternity ward.
He turned his back to us to see the slide. All the girls in the class exchanged glances with each
other. The girls from the Hong Kong office felt extra lucky to have such a hunk in their office.
Neel continued, We, on the other hand, belong to the death ward. We come in when the
company has failed, when the time has come to either try something drastic or. . .
He dramatically paused at the or for a few seconds before he spoke again. Or the time has
come to pull out the life support, or liquidate and close the company. How easy do you think that is?
He moved around the classroom and stopped right next to me. He had great perfume on, the
kind that makes you want to go closer and smell it some more.
You, young lady. You think it is easy to shut down factories and fire people?
I was gobsmacked. I didnt expect to be asked a question in the GS training class, which had
people from around the world. What if I said something stupid? What if everyone laughed at my
Delhi accent?
I got up, nervous.
Sit down, young lady, Neel said. Answer from your seat. Where are you from?
India, sir.
Ah, I grew up there. Moved to the UK when I was ten. Anyway, so when would you
recommend closing a business?
When all other alternatives have failed. When keeping it alive means throwing good money
after bad. When hope dies, I guess.
When hope dies. Nice way to put it. But isnt it heartbreaking when that happens? Neel said.
I remained silent. He moved to the front of the class.
Can you blame the undertaker for burying dead people? If people are dead, they need to be
buried, Neel said.
His macabre analogies made his point clear. It also added notoriety, a level of excitement to
distressed debt. What Neel said next helped further.
I became a partner in twelve years. Other parts of the firm, it takes twenty or more. Our
associates make what VPs make in other groups. I am not allowed to reveal numbers, but if you stick
around in distressed debt you will end up a very wealthy man or woman.
Goldman Sachs never liked to discuss wealth in public. This, despite the fact that everyone at
the firm was essentially there because of the money. Trainees whispered they had found out Neels
equity in the firm on the Internet. He had thirty million dollars worth of Goldman Sachs shares. His
hotness level spiked even more.
His session ended with thundering applause. He made a final announcement before he left.
We only have a few places in the group. Those interested, apply with the training coordinator.
We will shortlist and get back to you, he said and looked in my direction. Do try. Itll be worth it.
Did he just signal me to apply? Did he like my answer? My phone buzzed. Debu had sent a
message.
Tao restaurant. 58th Street and Park Avenue. 8 p.m. Okay?
Damn, I almost forgot. I had a date, or at least a lets meet for Chinese food tonight. Before
that I had something even more important. I had a waxing appointment.
Ohohoh. . . Slower, that hurts, I said to the waxing lady.
You havent done this before? said my fifty-year-old waxing lady, Catherine, politely, while
ripping the waxing strips off me most brutally.
I was lying down in my underwear. I had come to Completely Bare, a funky high-tech meets
comfy chic waxing studio on 68th Street and Madison.
I have. Twice in my life. In India. Years ago, I said.
Really? Did it hurt then?
Hell yeah, it did. Aditi didi had made me do it for a wedding in the family. I almost broke
family ties with her after that. If only Debu knew what I was going through to have a plate of noodles
with him. Catherine dipped a spatula in a bowl of molten wax.
Cold wax hurts more, but the results last longer, she said. She applied the wax on my upper
thigh, then put a white strip of cloth, six inches long and two inches wide, on that. Hair clung to it. I
felt the Armageddon coming.
Cant you give local anaesthesia or. . .oww. . .oww. . .oww. . .
Relax, honey, Catherine said.
I clenched my teeth and closed my eyes. I imagined myself in the Middle East. They punish
women with lashes if they do something awful like driving a car, offering men their opinions or
something totally immoral like exposing their elbows in public.
Fifty lashes for Radhika. I imagined a fatwa on me as Catherine went to work. She finished
my legs from the front and flipped me around. I felt like a fish being scaled before dinner.
You dont want a Brazilian? Catherine asked me. It is only fifteen dollars more.
Whats that? I said. Catherine rolled her eyes.
Its everything gone, honey. Down there too.
It took me a second to figure out what she meant. Then I realized the embarrassment and pain
involved.
Do girls do it? I said.
Everyone, honey. The boys dont like them bushes anymore.
Okay, I thought. Its only fifteen dollars more. I am Indian after all, and Indians like
bargains, even if they involve pain.
You want it? Catherine said.
Maybe I can do this. This is not for Debu or tonight. This is for me. Enough of being a
frumpy nerd, Radhika. Do it.
Sure, Ill take the Brazilian, I said.
I dont want to go into the details of what happened next. It started with Catherine examining
bits of me nobody else ever had, while she shook her head in disapproval. After that she applied
molten wax on body parts that were clearly never meant to ever come in contact with molten wax.
Why do we women put ourselves through this? Why cant boys. . .oww. . .oww. . .oww.
I think I would prefer the lashes in Saudi Arabia.
There we go, Catherine said after her ten-minute sadism experiment ended.
I might faint, I said.
You will get used to it, Catherine said. Trust me, he will love it.
There is no he, I wanted to tell her. I am only going to have wonton soup with him. Not wanton
sex.
Catherine came back with a strip of crystal dots.
And as a special promotion, we are giving all customers who got a Brazilian a free
Swarovski service. Allow me. This wont hurt at all.
I couldnt believe what happened next. Catherine made a pattern with thirty crystals down
there.
Once done, she told me to stand up and look into the mirror.
I look like a stripper, I said.
You look sexy.
I cant walk out with crystals on my. . .you know.
Dont worry. They wash off in a couple of days. Faster if you rub with soap.
Debu called.
Hey, done with training? You will be on time, right? Or should we make it 8.30? Debu said.
I am done. Was just taking care of some. . .internal issues. See you soon, I said.
You look, he paused, wonderful.
Thank you, I said.
Your dress is lovely too.
Look, no tag today, I said and turned around. Both of us laughed. I was wearing a military
green lace dress I had picked up from Gap. It ended well above the knees, exposing enough leg.
However, I still dont think Debu noticed the hundred dollars I spent fixing my limbs. The dim
lighting and the restaurant table covering my legs did no justice to the hour I had spent in the torture
chamber.
Debu ordered a set dinner for us.
We sat down in the upper level of Tao, a large-sized restaurant by New York standards.
Downstairs, we could see a giant Buddha and the Zen koi pond.
Nice place, I said.
Did you know they shot the Sex and the City movie here? Debu said.
I didnt. So how was your day?
Good. We are pitching for this new sportswear brand called Under Armor. If we get the
campaign it will be awesome. Hows Goldman?
Still in training. Busy. It will get even more hectic after work begins.
I told him about Neels distressed debt presentation. I recounted how I was questioned in front
of the entire class.
So I am thinking, I wont apply to distressed debt. Its quite difficult to get anyway. Plus, the
job seems too difficult, I said.
How can you not apply? Debu said. You are from IIMA. You will crack it.
People in my class are from top colleges around the world. Harvard, Stanford, you name it.
So what? You answered the question the partner asked you in the presentation, right?
I looked at Debu. He had listened to me with full attention. His deep black eyes flickered in
the candlelight. I leaned back on my seat and crossed my legs. They felt unusually smooth. I
remembered why and smiled.
Why are you smiling? he said.
Nothing. I shook my head.
Listen, he said and placed his hand on mine. You have to apply. Too many Indians come to
this city and get overwhelmed. Dont be underconfident. You can do it. You will.
Thanks. And you will win Under Armor, I said.
Cheers to that, he said and we lifted our water glasses. The waiter arrived with our food
chicken noodle soup and vegetable fried rice. The soup seemed a little too bland for my taste. I stuck
to the fried rice.
You arent having the soup. You dont like chicken?
I eat meat, but I prefer vegetarian, I said.
I am vegetarian too, he said.
Really?
I am a Bengali. For us, fish and chicken are vegetables.
Both of us laughed.
We chatted through dinner. He told me about his parents in Kolkata. His father owned a
printing press. It didnt really make much money now. His mother stayed at home. Debu grew up
dreaming about being a painter. He settled for commercial art as the practical choice. His parents had
saved enough to send him to do a course in design and arts in the US. He secured his current job
through campus placement.
Advertising sounds cool, I said, that too Madison Avenue. Best place to do it in the world.
Its not as cool on the inside. Theres constant politics. The money isnt great. I have been
lucky to work on good campaigns. However, juniors dont usually get much creative work.
I am sure it is not just luck. You must be really good.
He looked at me and smiled. He ate with chopsticks. I tried but failed. Mini-me told me not to
make an ass of myself and use a fork and spoon. I complied.
Thanks for the compliment, he said. Dessert?
I saw the menu. It had choices like sweet red bean pudding and tofu ice cream.
Red bean pudding? I said. What is that?
Rajma, Debu said. Rajma kheer of sorts.
Yuck, I said.
Chinese desserts are not famous. Theres a reasonthey suck, he said.
Bengali desserts are the best, I said.
Debus chest swelled with pride.
Bengali men arent too bad either, he said.
Did he just flirt with me? Is this flirting? Am I supposed to respond with something clever?
As sweet as their desserts? I said, one eyebrow up.
See, I can flirt back. Nerds can flirt.
He never expected a comeback. He took a second to take in my response.
Why dont you try and find out? he said.
Thats enough, Radhika, this is going into dangerous territory, I told myself. Deflect, change
the topic, fast. You dont want to be judged as a slut on the first date. See, this is what I do. When I
am with a man, I behave like I am sitting for a test. Answer the question properly. Act naïve as if I
dont understand his double meaning. Dont just be. Perform.
Dont know about the men. Id love to have a rasgulla though, I said, my voice as innocent
and dumb as possible. Alas, this is Manhattan.
Fear not. We Bengalis have left imprints everywhere. Would you like to go to a rasgulla
place?
Here? Now? In Manhattan?
He nodded and smiled. The bill arrived.
Should we split? I said and took out two twenty-dollar bills.
He thought about it for a second.
Actually, no. Can I treat you this time? he said.
Isnt that what dates are? I said to myself. But then, what about gender equality?
Why? I said. We can split.
No, he said as he took the money out of his wallet. Its not that much. You can buy the
rasgullas.
Debu and I took a yellow cab to 28th Street and Lexington Avenue, in an area called Murray Hill.
Its also called Curry Hill, Debu said as we stepped out of the taxi. I could see why. Indian,
Bangladeshi and Pakistani restaurants dotted both sides of the road. Some resembled roadside dhabas
back in India, complete with bright tubelights and plastic chairs.
Is this even New York? I laughed.
Its Midtown Manhattan, Debu said. You like it?
I love it. In fact, you could have just brought me here first.
Darn, wasted money at Tao. Didnt realize you could be a cheap date.
Date. He used the word date. I am on a date. I felt thrilled at the prospect of being on a date.
Even if at a ramshackle parantha shop called Lahori Kebab.
Can we have a parantha? I said.
Huh? Didnt we just eat?
I am Punjabi. Rice isnt dinner.
We walked into the shabby but brightly lit restaurant. Debu ordered two tandoori paranthas
with gobi stuffing inside.
Green chillies on the side, please, I said, my mouth salivating at the prospect. I noticed four
seedy-looking Indian guys in the restaurant. They wore neon construction-worker jackets. I caught
them staring at my legs.
Yes, finally I have an audience for all that effort, I said to myself.
Lets sit down, Debu said as he noticed the workers.
Nobody has ever checked out my legs, I wanted to tell him. Let me enjoy the moment. Oh well,
better be the good girl, you exhibitionist, mini-me said.
The restaurant had Indian desserts. Post-paranthas, we had two rasgullas each.
You better skip lunch tomorrow, mini-me said, there is no point in waxing fat legs.
Elephants dont wax, do they?
I love how you eat. You are enjoying this, Debu said to me.
Sorry. I havent had Indian food in weeks, I said.
He wiped my lips with a tissue. I smiled at him.
There are a couple of Indian restaurants in Brooklyn too, where I live, Debu said. He was
referring to another borough of New York, south of Manhattan.
You live in Brooklyn? I said. Most of my Goldman class planned to take apartments in
Manhattan. They considered Brooklyn too far.
Yeah. Told you. Advertising is glamorous only on paper. They dont pay. Thats the only
place we can afford a decent apartment.
We as in?
I share it. Two other guys from work.
Oh okay. I need to find an apartment soon too, I said.
The bill arrived. I paid this time, a total of eight dollars. We stood up to leave.
You want to see a movie next week? Shah Rukhs Don 2 is releasing, Debu said.
They have Indian movie theatres here? I said in excitement.
Just a couple. But they do, he said. Next Friday?
I nodded. The food in my mouth prevented me from talking.
Date two, baby, I said to myself and mentally high-fived.
O

One month later
n the last day of associate training, I received an email from my training manager, Jane
Rosenberg. She had called me to her office.
I wondered if I had done anything wrong. I had skipped class to meet Debu a few times. Had
they found out?
Debu and I had watched two movies, one Yankees baseball game and one Broadway musical
called The Lion King. We visited quaint restaurants all over Manhattan and ate Italian, Middle
Eastern and Indian food.
I had fallen in love with New York. I had also started liking Debu, even though things werent
romantic yet. Why wasnt he making a move? When would I have my own boyfriend? Would I ever
have my own boyfriend? Perhaps it was because of these insecurities inside me, but I wanted things
to change soon.
Our next date was tomorrow. I had picked a short wine-coloured dress, my boldest so far.
Jane asked you to come to her office as well? Mark, an American associate about my age,
came up to me.
Huh? I said, as I came back from my thoughts about what shoes to pair with my wine dress.
Yeah. How do you know?
You are copied on my email. Its you, me and another associate, Carl Wong.
I reached Janes office on the sixteenth floor of 85 Broad Street. Jane, in her forties, sat at her desk,
lost in her computer.
Welcome. You must be the new associates, Jane said as we sat down.
I looked at Mark and Carl. They seemed relaxed in contrast to a jittery me.
I have called you here because I have fresh offers for you. The three of you have been
selected for the Distressed Debt Group.
Yes! Mark said and fist-pumped. Carl and Mark high-fived each other.
Really? I said. Has there been a mistake? I wanted to ask. Sure, I had applied. I had also met
a few people as asked. However, I didnt really think I had a chance.
Its a tough challenge but a great opportunity, Jane was saying. Are you going to accept this
or do you want to be in another department?
Yes, of course, I accept, Mark said. Am going to kill it.
Totally accept, Carl said; his voice had an American accent even though he was ethnically
Chinese.
You, Raa-dee-kaa?
Yeah. Well, I am thinking.
What was I thinking? Has there been a mistake? Can I do this? Is this too difficult? This is
what girls like me do. The boys in front of me jumped up in confidence. I, on the other hand, tripleguessed
and quadruple-guessed myself.
Mini-me, will you be supportive and be quiet for once? I took a deep breath.
Yeah, I accept, I said.
I signed the offer letter and felt a surge of excitement. I wanted to share this with someone. I
decided to call home later when India woke up. However, mom and dad would have little idea about
my achievement.
Debu, I said as I called him after I left Janes office, I got distressed debt.
Didnt I say you could do it?
Yeah, you did. We will see if I can last. What are you doing?
You will do amazing. Im at work. Busy with a presentation. We are meeting tomorrow,
right?
Yeah. Can it be my treat? Training ended, I did make it to the best group. I think we should
celebrate.
Sure. I cant wait, Debu said.
I made another important call.
Completely Bare? I want to book a waxing appointment.
Champagne, madam, just as you ordered, the waiter said. He poured two glasses and put the bottle
in an ice bucket.
We had come to Aquagrill in Soho. The restaurant specialized in seafood. Debu had told me
he used to have fish with every meal back home in Kolkata. We chose the set dinner.
The waiter arrived with an appetizer made of salmon and asparagus.
This is amazing, Debu sighed.
You like seafood, thats why I chose this place, I said. He nodded and grinned, his mouth full
of food. I found his curly hair, beard and smile more adorable every time I met him.
My dress ended high on my thighs. I had not eaten any lunch to avoid love handles. I wondered
if he noticed.
We have seen each other every week since the first time we met, right? he said. I gazed at his
lips.
Yes, we have, but why havent we kissed yet? Is it wrong for a girl to think that? Should he
be asking me that instead? Where are the rules?
What are you thinking? Debu said. He snapped his fingers, as I didnt respond.
Huh? Oh, nothing. Just nervous about my new assignment, I guess.
How can a girl admit she is thinking about kissing? Isnt that what super-sluts do?
Relax. You can crack anything. You are really smart. One of the smartest people Ive met. I
looked at him.
Wow, a man who acknowledges a womans smartness. Now I want to kiss him even more. Are
you going to make a move, Debu? Or will you keep eating that shrimp cocktail in the martini
glass?
I brought my legs close and enjoyed their smoothness against each other. Debu, make the right
moves, and you could be a really happy man tonight.
Distressed debt. Sounds scary, though, Debu said.
How do I change the topic from distressed debt to my amazingly waxed legs? I couldnt. I
drained my champagne glass.
It is, I said. You have to negotiate with hard-nosed business owners. They sometimes refuse
to pay the bank. You have to seize properties. Squeeze out value.
Wow, Debu said. Doesnt sound like a regular banker on a desk job.
Yeah, I said. Also, there are hardly any women in the team. Its a mans job.
What nonsense, Debu said. Why cant a woman do it? They are better negotiators.
I like this man. A lot. Go on, Debu.
He continued, Its all this bullshit men spread. To scare women out of a role or position. Fact
is, men are shit-scared of talented women like you.
Thanks, Debu.
Okay, I had a challenge bigger than distressed debt tonight. I had to ensure Debu made a move,
so some naughtiness could happen. Of course, because I am a woman, I somehow also had to pretend
to be innocent, as if I had no role to play in making anything happen. I had to steer him without him
realizing he had been steered.
The waiter brought us our final course of codfish served with miso sauce.
Wow, Debu said as he took a bite, best fish I have ever tasted. In fact, maybe the best thing I
have ever tasted.
Yeah. Well, theres still dessert, save the best for the last, I said.
Was that double meaning? Fuck, dont slutify yourself.
He laughed. Did he get the reference?
You know Bongs and mishti, he said. No, he didnt. Be careful. Always give out a chaste
good-Indian-girl vibe.
Hows work? I said.
Its great. Under Armor account is almost in, he said and crossed his fingers.
I am sure it will come in, I said.
It will be my first big win. My boss said if I get it I get promoted to senior creative
associate.
That sounds a lot cooler than distressed debt associate.
He laughed.
You get the bucks. Thats cool enough, he said.
Somehow I never wanted to discuss the money I made with Debu. I had to shift the topic back
to him.
Under Armor is a cutting-edge brand. I saw their store yesterday. Great stuff, I said.
I cant wait to work on their campaign.
We had a dark chocolate mousse cake with orange sauce as our last dish.
Great choice of restaurant, Radhika, Debu said. At first I thought this place too fancy, but
look at the food. Wow.
We finished our meal and the bill arrived. The waiter handed it to Debu, but I plucked it from
his hands. I had told Debu it would be my treat. I had a quick look. The bill came to 200 dollars. I
placed the cash in the bill folder and handed it to the waiter.
Is it a lot? Debu said. It is, isnt it? Why did you spend so much?
Look, I wanted to celebrate with you. My only true friend in New York. So thank you for
being there.
I held my champagne glass high. He did the same and made a toast.
Congratulations. To my talented friend Radhika, who will kick ass at distressed debt and
show the men how it is done, he said.
We decided to walk from Aquagrill to the Benjamin Hotel, a half-an-hour stroll. From there Debu
could get a direct 4 train to Brooklyn. I had thirty minutes to get this man to make a move. A part of
me wanted to scream, Oh Debu, just kiss me already.
Of course, a lifetime of brainwashing to be a good Indian girl would never allow me to do
that.
He didnt make any move. However, he did say amazing things on our walk.
Its really important that women do well. It sets an example for other younger women. It
inspires them, he said.
Who am I inspiring? I said, my mind filled with alternate thoughts. Did he notice my legs
yet? Did dinner make my stomach less flat? Are my boobs in place? Can this guy walk slower so I
can keep up in my heels?
Of course you are an inspiration. To your younger cousins, for example. I am sure they will
see their Radhika didi and want to be like her.
I laughed.
What? he said.
I dont know. My sister Aditi has more fans. She barely graduated. She knows make-up and
clothes way better than me, though.
That is when Debu said something, something even better than the amazing things he had said
about my work and intelligence.
You have great taste in clothes, he said.
Oh, I love this man. He must be partially blind but I love this man.
Really? I said. I found it hard to take a compliment that didnt involve grades or job
interviews.
Yeah. You have this subtle, understated style. This red dress, pardon me, but. . .
But what? I said. Is it ripped somewhere? I thought in horror.
Pardon me, but it makes you look so hot, he said.
Oh Debu! Bless him, gods. Give him any advertising account he wants. For the first time in
my life, apart from when I had fever, I had been associated with the word hot. Someone in this world
found me hot. Hot. Fuck, Radhika, someone called you hot. My soul break-danced inside me.
Really? I said, my tone as casual as possible, even as I fished for more.
Yeah. You dont mind me saying that, I hope.
Do I mind? Bring it on, dude. We have ten more minutes to reach the hotel. Please keep
praising me. The shallower the better. Make it only about clothes, looks and legs. Those are the
compliments I miss. Of course, I have to say it in a way that he doesnt think I am too keen.
No, I dont mind. Usually we talk about more intellectual and work-related stuff. It is strange
but no, its okay. Curious to see how you men think, I said and giggled like an idiot.
I think you have a nice figure, he said.
Which part, which part? I wanted to scream in excitement. Do you like my waist? Boobs?
Ass? Be articulate, Debu.
Really? I said, dragging out the word, as if I never expected this. I punched his shoulder
subtle encouragement and fake shyness all rolled into one.
Yeah. Your legs, I mean. . .you have nice legs.
Oh, so that is all you like about me?
Desperate, lame, stupid. What was that, Radhika? I told myself as I fished. Oh I didnt just
fish. I sent a fishing team with a trailer to catch a shipload.
No, no. I like your face too. Your hair. Your eyes. Your whole personality, actually.
Yeah, yeah. Now you will say all this. Its about the legs, right?
It better be about the legs. I paid 100 dollars to Completely Bare.
No, no. Sorry. . . I mean. . .
Relax, Debu. I am kidding, I said and squeezed his warm hand. I didnt want to let go of it.
However, I didnt want it to count as a move either. Why do we girls have to follow so many rules?
If he likes my whole personality, why cant I be fully me?
I released his hand. We walked past a Barnes and Noble bookstore and had to cross a traffic
signal. He used it as an excuse to hold my hand. We crossed the road together. He didnt release my
hand afterwards.
I gave him a sideways glance. He smiled at me.
My sister is considered the prettier one, actually, I said.
I find that quite hard to believe. Unless she is Miss Universe or something.
I smiled at his indirect compliment. I felt like running my fingers through his curly hair.
He continued, Actually, even if she is Miss Universe. I find you really pretty.
Sweet lies, they do have a place in life. I sighed.
Thanks, Debu, I said.
We reached the Benjamin Hotel. We had made some progress. We had held hands, but only
that. Did I intimidate him? Did he totally lie but actually not find me attractive? Is he scared?
So this is where I live. Train stop is right there. I pointed at the subway sign.
Sure, he said. I had a great time. Thanks for the treat.
You are welcome, I said. Bye.
My heart sank a bit. I didnt want him to go.
Hey, just one thing. Doesnt have to be today, he said.
Yeah? I said.
You have your sisters photo in your room? Wanted to check. I am sure the claim that she is
prettier is false, he said.
Was that a move? He mentioned my room. Did he want to come upstairs? Or he could
technically want me to go up and bring down some pictures. Heck, I had Aditi didis photos on my
phone. So is this a move? Will someone tell me, please?
I smiled at him.
No, really, Debu said,
Thats sweet. So are you.
Pretty?
I laughed. No. Handsome. Smart. Creative too.
Thanks, he said.
Okay, I think I have some photos on my laptop upstairs. You want to come up? I said.
N
8
o way, Debu said. She is not prettier than you.
Oh, come on, I said. Aditi didi is so nice-looking.
Listen, sure she is, but not more than you. No way. You have better features.
Thats not what my mother led me to believe, I said.
Must be the Punjabi thing. The whiter the skin, the prettier the person. Nonsense, he said,
somewhat agitated.
We sat on the edge of the hotel bed, my laptop in the middle. I had a two-year-old family
album open on the screen.
All my life I have been this nerdy, studious girl. Aditi didi is considered the looker.
Sorry, shes your sister, but she dresses like she is going to a party even for random family
pictures at home.
She is like that, I said.
You did wear horrible glasses though, Debu said.
I laughed.
I switched to contacts a year ago, I said, and pointed to a picture of my family in our living
room. That is dad. Simple, quiet man. Just doesnt want people in society to say anything critical of
him. This is my mother. Dominates dad totally.
Debu examined the pictures as I spoke again.
I miss home, I said. Seeing these pictures I miss India. I want to watch TV serials with my
mother and do nothing.
Says the new hotshot distressed debt banker. Too late, girl. Debu laughed.
I made a mock-sad face.
I need a hug. Move things forward, Debu. Do I have to give you an instruction manual?
Its a sweet family, Debu said.
It is, I said. I wanted to stall the conversation with short, boring replies. Awkward silences
lead to many interesting things.
Unfortunately, certain intellectual Bengali men dont often get the hint.
Have you read The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf? Debu said.
No, whats that?
A landmark feminist book. It talks about how women are culturally bullied into feeling
conscious about their looks all the time, he said.
Really? Well, to a certain extent its true, I said.
Yeah. Do men compare their physicality with their siblings so much?
I guess not. At another time or place, like at one of our Friday dinners, I would have liked to
engage in this intellectually stimulating conversation. Not now. I had other things on my mind.
Exactly, he said, she says it is a way for men to control women and. . .
My feet are killing me, I interrupted him. I removed my shoes. I brought my feet up on the
bed. My short dress inched up a little further on my thighs. Debu forgot his chain of thought. I guess
there are ways for women to control men too.
Sorry, what were you saying? I said. I squeezed and released my toes.
Huh? he said. Nothing. I will give you the book.
Not used to walking long distances in heels, I said.
Do you want me to give you a foot massage? he said.
And the Republic Day bravery award finally goes to Debashish Sen, I wanted to announce.
Really? I said. You know how to?
It was one of those stupid things girls sometimes say. We know it is stupid but we say it
anyway to act naïve or whatever.
I loved his hands on my feet.
Wow, thats nice, I said. He pressed my feet timidly, as if I would get up and slap him any
second.
He massaged my shins. His hands slowly moved up to my knees. I didnt stop him.
Do you have lotion? he said. I pointed to the bedside table. He took a bottle of moisturizer
and splashed it on my feet. I jerked as the cold lotion touched my skin. He put his warm hands on my
legs. He moved them in a sliding motion from shin to knee.
I closed my eyes. I could feel his hands reach above my knees. Nobody had ever touched me
there before, unless you count the waxing torture-chamber lady. Tingles of pleasure ran up my thighs.
He became bolder every minute, going higher. We didnt exchange a word. He reached the
hem of my dress. His fingers danced tantalizingly upon my thighs.
Is this all moving too fast? a voice within me said. Heck, I didnt care.
Is this okay? Debu said.
I nodded. I opened my eyes. I signalled him to bring his face closer to mine. He leaned
forward. Our lips met. I kissed for the first time in my life.
I could feel he had bottled up his desire too. His lips refused to leave mine. Our tongues
touched. I lost track of time, space and orientation. I had seen kisses in the movies. I had imagined
what my first one would be like. But this was better. Better than anything I had seen or imagined.
You are so beautiful, he whispered into my ear as he nibbled my earlobe.
He placed his hand on my breast, over my dress. He wanted to slide his hand in but couldnt. I
would have had to remove the entire fitted dress to give him access.
I pushed back his chest.
Is this going too fast? I said. Like any guy would actually say, Yes, it is.
No. Of course not. It feels right, Debu said, one hand on my thigh.
He moved his other hand to my back, trying to find the zipper for my dress.
Theres too much light, I said. Sure, he had praised my body. However, I had never taken off
my clothes in front of a man. I couldnt with so much light.
He switched off all the lights in the room. The window curtains remained open. The dim light
from the Manhattan skyline was just about enough for us to see each other.
I had worn a new matching pair of red lingerie from Triumph, in anticipation.
Debu pulled my dress off. He unhooked my bra from behind. He removed his shirt as well.
What are you making me do, Debu? I whispered as I held my unhooked bra in place with my
hands. I felt I had to make it seem like he made me do this. Never mind the pre-planned lingerie.
Just go with the flow, Debu said, standard boy-speak for let me please have sex without
interruption.
He pulled the red bra out of my hands. He grabbed my breasts.
Not so hard, please, I said.
Sorry, Debu said.
You have done this before? I said.
He took a few seconds to answer.
If I say yes, will you ask me to stop? Debu said.
I laughed.
No, silly. Just that this is my first time, I said.
I had one girlfriend before. Two years back.
Can we not talk about that now? I said.
He kissed my nipples. He moved up and kissed my collarbone. He kissed my chin and then my
lips for several minutes. He tugged at my panties. My heart beat fast. Was I really going to get fully
naked in front of a man?
I guess it was too late. He pulled down my panties. He removed his trousers and underwear. I
had not seen a naked man so up-close. I wanted to get a good look, more as an anatomy lesson.
However, he held me tight and continued to kiss me. His hands moved higher on my thighs.
Your legs are so soft, he said. I decided to take a life membership at Completely Bare.
He touched me between my legs. The Brazilian had made everything smooth.
Wow, you are wet, he said.
I wasnt just wet. I was soaked. The good girl in me wondered if he would judge me for it.
He bent and brought his face closer between my legs.
What are you doing? I said.
Huh? Going down.
Down where? I said.
Down. There.
Really? Your mouth? There?
Yeah. Just relax.
I cant really describe the next ten minutes. His tongue felt the exact opposite of the brutal
waxing strips. Every flick transported me to a state of extreme pleasure. Why dont people do this all
the time? Wow, why didnt anyone tell me sex feels so damn good?
He put a finger inside me. I winced once.
Careful, I said.
Does it feel good? he said.
I nodded, my eyes closed.
He continued to work with his tongue. I became more aroused. I soon reached a point where
the intensity became too much.
Stop, I said.
What? he said.
Come here, I said.
He came up close. I kissed him, which was a little strange considering where his mouth had
been just now.
He climbed over me.
May I? he said.
Was I going to have sex? Had I finally grown up? But wait, should I?
I have protection, he said.
Damn, did the guy anticipate this? Was I too easy?
I happened to have it in my wallet, Debu said, as if reading my mind.
I didnt want to think anymore. I gave him the slightest nod.
He entered me gently. It hurt a bit. Frankly, his tongue had felt better. However, this is what
people call sex, I thought, so I guess this is what we have to do.
Radhika Mehta, you are finally having sex, I said to myself and mentally high-fived. It felt
like a major milestone in life, on par with getting into IIMA or scoring Goldman Sachs. Or distressed
debt. Will that job be tough? Okay, why am I thinking about distressed debt when there is a man in
me?
You feel so amazing, he said.
I was glad he felt that way. As for me, I couldnt see what the big fuss was about sex.
How do I ask him to do that going down stuff again? Is it too late? What is the protocol in
bed?
His strokes became faster. He gripped me tight on my shoulders and groaned. I guess he had
had an orgasm. He gasped for a few seconds as he went lax on me.
Wow, Debu said. Amazing, isnt it?
So, how did I feel after having sex the first time? Well, you know how you sometimes wait for
a big Salman or Shah Rukh movie for months and then it finally arrives? You go for the first day first
show, and then the movie is not bad, but not so great either.
Yeah, was amazing, I said. I guess its just polite to agree with people in bed.
He slid off me and lay on the side. He stared at the ceiling. We held hands.
You are wonderful. Thank you, he said.
Thank you? What on earth was that? Is the show over? Why is he plopped like a phone
without charge now?
Was it good? I said.
I repeat, amazing. I am so spent and finished.
Finished?
Satisfied, I mean, he said.
Debu.
Yeah.
Can you make me spent and finished too? Please?
Huh? Debu said. He turned to me, surprised.
That going down thing you did. Can you do it a bit more? I said.
Sure, baby.
Good. I guess that didnt make me the shy and coy girl all Indian girls should be. Maybe it
even made me seem like a slut. However, I would rather be a spent and finished slut than a good but
frustrated Indian girl.
Five minutes later, I moaned out loud too. Wow. I pressed his head hard between my legs. My
legs shook, and then my whole body. Okay, so this is what an orgasm feels like.
How are you? he said.
I hid my face in embarrassment.
What? I said, How are you. He laughed.
Spent. And finished.

Two months later
e are stuck in this MegaBowl deal, said Jonathan Husky, vice president and my boss in the
Distressed Debt Group.
My phone buzzed in my pocket. I checked the time. It was 7 in the evening. I had to meet Debu
in an hour. It seemed undoable.
We sat in the meeting room of the Goldman Sachs Distressed Debt Group. From the Goldman
side, there was Jonathan, Clark Smith, who was another associate in the group, and me. We also had a
representative from each of the seven banks that had lent to MegaBowl, a Boston-based builder of
bowling alleys. While people who played in their bowling alleys had fun, their creditors had a
different story. MegaBowl had defaulted on fifty million dollars worth of loans.
There are no assets, Jonathan continued. The company has nothing apart from lots of
bowling pins and bowling balls.
Recovering fifty million dollars would require a lot of bowling balls, I thought. The bankers
looked at each other in silence, sympathizing with each other for their collective stupidity in lending
so much money to MegaBowl.
Tell us what to do, one of the bankers said. We just want out. I cant deal with their stupid
CEO.
My hand went into my handbag and grabbed my phone.
Radhika. Jonathan saying my name startled me. Please share the plan.
Damn, I needed a minute to tell Debu I couldnt make it tonight. I released my phone and
brought my hand out of my bag.
Eh, sure, Jonathan, I said. I shared the special booklets I had prepared for the meeting.
Our basic premise, I said, opening the first page, is to keep MegaBowl as a going concern.
There is little value in liquidation, just about six cents on the dollar. However, it is fifty cents if we
allow the CEO to continue.
Fire him, Dirk Grigly, a fat and bald banker from Bank of America, said. He has caused all
the mess.
He has, yes, I said, but we need him to stabilize operations for now. We also have to
retrench people and cut salaries. Lets use him to do the dirty work.
I walked them through the plan. It would enable the company to reduce its size and reduce
costs.
The bankers pored over the booklets. I thought of an excuse I could use to take out my phone. I
didnt want Debu to leave for the restaurant.
The bankers cared little about my boyfriend.
Whats the guarantee it is going to work? one of the lenders said.
There isnt, I said, but now that we have finally valued the business, twenty-five million is
maximum recovery. Or fifty cents on the dollar.
We can offer thirty cents, Jonathan said, and you can be out of this.
Thats how we worked. Bid at thirty cents, hoped to recover fifty.
Thirty cents? Dirk said. Thats nothing.
Goldman is taking all the risk here of reviving it, Jonathan said.
The creditors huddled together.
Should we leave you alone for ten minutes? Jonathan said and stood up.
Yes, this was my chance to make my call. Jonathan, Clark and I left the room.
I rushed back to my cubicle.
I called Debu.
Hey baby, where are you? I was just about to leave. Did you see my messages? Debu said.
No, I just stepped out of a never-ending creditor meeting.
What?
We are about to close a deal. My first, actually.
Its 7.30. We have an 8 oclock reservation. Comedy Cellar doesnt allow you late entry.
I am so sorry. Can you cancel it, please?
Weve already paid. Fifteen bucks each.
I know. I am so sorry.
What? Really? he said, his voice low.
Can I make it up to you? Tonight? Come over to my place.
When?
Have your dinner and come over. I will join you soon.
I hung up and waited at my desk. I had rented a one-bedroom unit in Tribeca, one of the closest
residential neighbourhoods from Wall Street. Debu had an extra set of keys, as he came over on a
regular basis.
I had gone to his place in Brooklyn only a few times. A typical bachelor pad, it had more beer
than groceries in the fridge. He shared the apartment with two other guys, offering us little privacy.
They kept their house keys under a potted plant outside the house. When I asked Debu why, he said,
Just simpler, baby, we lost six duplicate keys in the last three months.
My desk phone rang. Jonathan had called from the meeting room.
Can you and Clark come over? he said.
Clark and I reached the meeting room.
Clark, Radhika, I am happy to say the lender group here has agreed. We have a deal. Your
first, right?
Yes. That is great news, I said.
Radhika, we need a quick term sheet. The remaining documentation can be done later.
My heart sank. A term sheet would take a couple of hours. Jonathan and Clark took the lenders
downstairs for a drink to Harrys Café & Steak, two blocks from the Goldman building. I worked at
my desk, drafting the term sheet with all the deal conditions.
Jonathan came up to my desk late at night. He looked at his watch.
Ten minutes to midnight. Oh no. Sorry about this. You should go home, Radhika, he said.
Just mailed you the final term sheet. I logged out of my computer.
Well done. You were fantastic in this deal. You are a real asset to the group, Jonathan said.
I felt a warm glow of happiness inside me as I left the Goldman building. Jonathans words
stayed in my head. I couldnt wait to share them with Debu.
I am sleeping, baby, Debu complained as I switched on the bedroom ceiling light.
Sorry, I said as I switched the light off. I turned on the bedside lamp instead.
What time is it? he said in a sleepy voice.
12.30, I said.
What? he said, and opened his eyes wide. You were in office until now?
Yeah. What to do? My first big deal. You know what Jonathan told me?
What?
Radhika, you are a real asset to the group.
Why not? They seem to be dumping all their work on you.
Nothing like that. They stayed late too. Many little things one has to be careful about in the
documentation. It took me a while.
Did you eat dinner?
No, baby, I said.
What? Debu sat up in bed.
I didnt get the time.
This is terrible. Wait.
He got off the bed, walked up to the open kitchen in the living room and took out a tray of eggs
from the fridge.
Ill make you some bhurji, he said, have it with bread.
Go to sleep. I will have some cereal.
Have something hot.
I will have my hot boyfriend then. Come here.
I pulled him by his T-shirt and kissed him.
Sorry I was late. Let me make it up to you, I said.
He pushed me away.
Wait, eggs first.
He got busy whipping the eggs. He cut onions and tomatoes and placed a saucepan on the
stove. Ten minutes later he served me my dinner.
Try, he said.
I took a bite.
How is it? he said.
Yum. Thank you.
Welcome.
Debu, listen.
What?
I love you.
I love you too. Just dont get to see you much.
Sorry, baby.
Lets move in together. That way I will see you at least.
I became silent.
I will share the rent. Dont worry.
Not that, silly. But thats a live-in. That means we are in a serious relationship.
Arent we? Debu said.
I smiled at him.
Keep the place clean, okay? I said.
I

One year later
will think about marriage later, mom. I am still new at my job. Let me focus on that. Please, I
said.
I ran down the subway steps to the Wall Street station platform. The Friday evening rush hour
made it difficult for me to hear her.
What? I said, as the sound of an arriving train drowned her words.
Job is not that important, she said. I could hear sounds of her making tea in her kitchen. It
was 8.30 in the evening for me, 6 in the morning for her. Jonathan had made me do a presentation
twice, giving me a dirty look when he noticed some inadvertent typos.
It is important. I am in the most challenging group in the firm. Everyone here thinks I am one
of the best, I said.
What about everyone here thinking why isnt Mr Mehtas second daughter getting married? Is
something wrong with her?
Really, mom? You think something is wrong with me?
I stepped into the number 3 train. The doors shut. I had just three stops to Chambers Street in
Tribeca, a five-minute subway ride. Somehow, speaking to mom made it seem much longer.
Its been a year since you have been abroad. Your sister married two years ago. Let us at least
start looking. It takes a while, you know.
Aditi didi wanted to get married. I dont.
You dont?
Not yet. Look at my life. I just finished work. Its 8.30 at night here.
What kind of a job is this? Making girls stay so late.
Can you stop criticizing every aspect of my life? I am not ready to get married or even look at
any options.
Well, I didnt need more options. My option had messaged me thrice as he waited for me for
dinner.
So what do you want? mom said.
Many other things. I want to do well at work. I want to be promoted this year, get a good
bonus. I want to travel. Enjoy New York. Come home and visit all of you.
Is there a boy? she said.
My heart skipped a beat. My mothers sixth sense had sprung up.
No. Not really, I said. I guess telling her about my live-in status with a guy for the past one
year would be too much to share at one go.
Meaning?
I have friends. Like this guy, Debashish. He is also from SRCC.
Debashish who? she said, her voice curious.
Debashish Sen. Senior in college. Didnt know him then. Works in Manhattan at an ad
agency.
Bengali? she said, a tinge of disgust in her tone.
Yeah. Why?
Nothing. They are smelly, no? They eat a lot of fish.
What nonsense!
Anyway. I hope he is just a friend.
I had an urge to tell her that we had contraceptives on our grocery list.
Yes. I hardly get time. But I have met him.
Met him?
In groups, nothing more, I said hurriedly.
Why am I not telling her? I should tell her. However, this Debu has to get his act together
and tell me first.
You are not the boyfriend and love types. Aditi was like that.
What is that supposed to mean? I said, my voice loud enough to startle two skinny girls
sitting next to me.
Nothing. You are the studious types. What boyfriend and all you will make? We will have to
find someone for you.
Really, mom? You would do that for me? Thank you. How can I ever repay you?
Its okay. We are parents. It is our duty.
She doesnt get sarcasm at all. I wanted to lash out more. I wanted to say, Sure, thanks, mom,
do hook me up with someone. For who else would take your unlovable daughter?
I chose not to aggravate the situation. I took a deep breath instead.
My station has arrived. You made tea?
Yeah, I did. I can talk some more. Your father is still in the bathroom.
I stepped out of the train. I climbed up the stairs and came out to Chambers Street. My house
was a six-minute walk from here.
Hows dad? I said.
Waiting for his tea. He still has to figure out what to do with his retired life.
Did you get the money?
It was too much, beta.
Just tell dad to change his car, please. At least get a Honda City. That Maruti belongs in a
museum.
I will tell him. We feel bad taking money from our daughter.
Why? If I were your son it would be okay?
Yes. But you are not, no?
So what? I am your child. Why cant I help improve your lifestyle?
With sons it is different. Its like your right.
Mom, you know all this stuff irritates me a lot. I have had a long day. I was in office for
thirteen hours. Can you please say something nice?
We miss you.
I miss you guys too.
We feel bad. Our daughter is working thirteen hours a day and sending money home. We may
have limited means after dads retirement, but things are not so bad.
Again, mom, I said, my voice upset, you have to stop. Let me do things for my family.
Dont shout at me. Its early morning here.
Well, you have to stop irritating me.
I am not irritating you. You keep saying family. If you dont get married how will you have
a family?
Bye, mom. I dont want to lose it. Please go have tea with dad.
Did I say anything wrong now? Its a fact, no?
I have reached home. I have to take the lift. I will talk to you later.
As you wish. All you kids behave in this hi-fi manner now. Call whenever. End whenever.
Shout whenever. I am just your mother.
I took three deep breaths.
I am sorry for shouting at you, I said.
You are becoming too aggressive. If you stay like this who will. . .
Before she could say that my aggression would hamper my chances of getting married, I had to
end the call.
Sorry, I said, I am sorry.
Go rest. Dont work so hard.
I entered the apartment. Debu sat in the living room watching football on TV. He wore a loose grey Tshirt
and a pair of black shorts. He held a can of beer in his hand.
Hey, he said, his eyes not moving an inch from the screen.
Hi, I said, my voice curt. Is it too much for him to get up from the sofa and give me a hug?
I removed my jacket and placed it on the dining table. I saw takeaway bowls from Mr Chow, a
Chinese restaurant in Tribeca.
You ordered in? I said.
Yeah. Felt too lazy to make anything. Plus, there was this game.
This food is too greasy for me. You could have ordered something healthier.
Mr Chow is cheap. Have you seen the portion sizes? It will last us two days.
I dumped my handbag on the dining chair. Sometimes, I wished Debu wasnt so obsessed
about saving a few bucks.
I fought with my mother. I called her to have a chat and ended up yelling at her.
Uh huh, he said, eyes on the TV. Thats not nice.
Debu, can you please shut the TV off for a minute? I said. Screamed, in fact.
Debu looked mildly surprised. He didnt switch off the TV, but muted it. He turned to me.
What happened, baby?
Ive come home after a long day. Can you just pretend to be happy to see me?
Of course I am happy, baby.
Give me a hug. Dont just say hey when I enter the house.
He sprang up from his seat. He came up to me and hugged me.
I pushed him away. Not when I have to ask. And be interested. My mom and I had a huge
argument.
What about?
Guess.
Your marriage? Her whole who will marry my poor daughter routine?
Yes, Debu, I said, glaring at him. You are so clever to figure it out. But seriously, who will
marry her poor daughter?
My mother and I had at least one blowout per week about my marriage. Debu knew about it. I
hoped he would get into action and propose a plan. Of course, a stupid minor league American
football game was more important. I continued to glare at him.
What? Debu said. Stop letting her affect you so much. Shes regressive and old-fashioned.
He took a paper plate and scooped some noodles on it. He handed it to me, a cheap portion of
chowmein to compensate for my uncertain future.
Debu, really? Is that what you think I am upset about?
Its not? he said, his face blank.
Why dont guys ever get it? Its never just one thing with women. Its a long day at work,
dirty looks from my boss, seeing women thinner than me in the train, arguing with my mother,
coming home to a disinterested boyfriend and then eating greasy food for dinner that would make
me even fatter than the skinny girls on the train. Oh, and add boyfriend never having the guts to
discuss our future.
No, I said, in as patient a voice as possible, it isnt only that.
Oh, he said, genuinely astonished.
Debu, what the fuck!
What? What did I do?
What did you not do?
The hug? I am sorry about the hug, baby.
Its not the hug. Its us. Are you so thick or are you pretending to be so?
Be clear, baby.
Dont baby me.
I pushed my plate away. I didnt want to eat this cardiac arrest on a plate. I didnt want to
listen to the baby, baby crap.
Whats the matter?
Debu, where are we going?
Meaning?
I picked up the remote and switched off the TV.
Us. Where is this relationship going? My mother wants me to get married. Are you listening?
But you dont want to, right? Not right now, right? he said, puzzled.
But where do you see us in the future, Debu?
I love you, baby. I mean, Radhika. And you love me. We love each other so much. Who else
do we have, really?
Love is fine. Yes, I do love you. Frankly, sometimes I feel I am too involved with you. I cant
even think of another guy. Maybe that is why I flare up with mom.
So thats good, no?
But do we have a future? Or are we just sharing rent and having sex?
Dont talk like that.
I walked across the room and sat on the sofa. I switched on the TV again.
He came and switched it off.
Why did you switch on the TV? he said.
You wont talk, I said, and you tell me not to talk. So what to do? Lets pretend there is no
problem.
Okay, I will talk, Debu said.
Sure. I am listening.
Its my job. I am waiting for this promotion.
Its supposed to come through next month.
Yeah, but you never know. Its crazy. Two of my peers told my boss I dont deserve the
promotion. Advertising is dog-eat-dog. I am so stressed.
Well, thats terrible. But how is this relevant when it comes to us?
I want to be a senior creative director. Get a raise. A few more accounts. I want to be a little
more solid at work before thinking about marriage. I want to focus on my career, not get distracted.
I am not asking you to marry me next week.
I just. . . Okay, fine, I want to get past this promotion. Win a couple more accounts. I will be
ready to take the next step then.
What do I tell mom?
Tell her about me. Tell her you have a boyfriend.
Shes not like that. She will flip out. I will tell her once, and at the right time. When it is time
to take things ahead.
Your wish, he said. Come here.
I didnt move from my seat. He came to me and held me.
I love you, he said.
Me too. Sorry I snapped at you.
We lay down in bed. He ran his fingers up and down my arm.
Not tonight, Debu, I said. Just not in the mood.
You will feel better.
No, I said.
He placed a hand on my breast. I pushed it away.
Focus on your career, Debu, dont get distracted. Goodnight.
F

oreclose on the company properties first. Scare him so he plays ball, I said to Jonathan. We
stood by the coffee machine in the office pantry. We were talking about MedTron, a semiconductor
company gone bust.
Thats true. Smart suggestion, Jonathan said.
I made two espressos and passed him a cup.
My phone rang. Debu. I looked at it and put it aside.
Go ahead, take it, Jonathan said.
Its a personal call. I can call back, I said.
No, go ahead. Ill see you back at your desk.
Jonathan left the pantry. I picked up the phone.
Hi, I said. A middle-of-the-day call. Nice!
Well, you are speaking to a senior creative director of BBDO, he said.
Oh my God! It happened! Congrats, Debu. This is headline news.
Thank you. You are the first person I called.
Of course. We totally need to celebrate this.
Its okay. They promoted two others too.
Its huge. You know it is. Anyway, I got to go. Need to make some calls. What time will you
be home today?
7.30. Why?
Nothing. I might get a little late. Okay, Mr Senior Creative Director, bye!
I hammered out a quick plan. I messaged Avinash, Ashish and Nidhi.
Kind of big news. Debu got promoted. My boyfriend is a senior creative director! Surprise
celebration drinks. Our place. 7 p.m. sharp. 55B, 50 Franklin Street, Tribeca.
Within minutes everyone confirmed. I messaged a few others. Some wanted to bring their
friends along. In half an hour, I had a mini-party organized with about a dozen confirmed guests.
Finally, I dashed Debu a message.
Busy day. May get late. Have dinner and sleep.
Surprise! everyone shouted in unison as a clueless Debu opened the door. His shocked and dazed
expression had everyone bursting into laughter and made my hours of frantic preparation worthwhile.
I had ordered pizzas from Rays. The salads, nuts and bar snacks came from Whole Foods.
Champagne was chilling in the freezer. It was the first time Debu and I had so many guests in our little
apartment. Chatter and laughter filled the living room. It made my world seem complete. My house
felt like a home. I dimmed the lights and turned up the music.
What a great party! Nidhi said.
Template for you. You never do such surprises for me, Ashish, now her husband, said.
We are married. They are boyfriend and girlfriend. Theres a difference.
Whatever, Ashish said. Nidhi laughed.
I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around. It was Debu. He looked deep into my eyes.
I love you, he said.
I love you too, I said.
Debu pecked me on the lips. Avinash whistled. Everyone looked at us. I covered my face in
embarrassment. The house felt warm and fuzzy. I had never been happier in my whole life.
I just told you this afternoon. How did you do all this so fast? Debu said.
I took the rest of the day off.
Thank you for making me feel so special, superwoman.
You are welcome. But you are still helping me clean up after the party, okay? I said.
Three months later
Superb job on MegaBowl. We will recover thirty million, not twenty-five. Well done, Radhika! I
read Jonathans old email on my laptop. He had copied Jon Cruz, a partner in the Distressed Debt
Group. Jon had sent a well done email as well.
Baby, shut your laptop. Come, lie down, Debu said in a drowsy voice. I was sitting next to
him on the bed. I had switched off the room lights. However, the glare of the laptop screen bothered
him.
Its still too bright. What time is it? Debu said.
11.30, I said. Only a few more minutes, I promise.
He exhaled noisily.
What are you working on? he said, putting his arm around my waist. I nudged the laptop
higher to accommodate him.
My own performance review. I have to turn it in tomorrow.
You are amazing, he said and nuzzled my shoulder.
Unfortunately, no such option here. I have to write details on all the deals I worked on in the
past year.
They know you are good. Come, sleep. Let me hold you. He pulled me closer.
You sleep. I know the laptop is bothering you. I will sit in the living room, I said.
Its cold.
Ill turn on the heat in the hall, I said. I kissed Debu on the forehead, climbed off the bed and
shut the door.
I went into our living room, adjusted the thermostat and sat on the couch. I opened my laptop
again and read the performance review form.
List instances where you added significant value in a deal.
I had worked on three deals this last year; MegaBowl was the deal I had contributed to the
most. I entered the details. Last year, when I joined the firm fresh out of college, we had had a fixed
bonus. My performance review would decide my bonus this year.
I reached the last question.
What is your overall assessment of your performance on a scale of 15, based on the
classification below:
1: Significantly below expectations
2: Below expectations
3: Meets expectations
4: Better than expectations
5: Significantly better than expectations
I pondered on my overall rating for a few minutes. Choosing a 5 felt pompous. I settled for a
3 and pressed submit.
Done? I heard Debus voice from the bedroom.
Yeah, coming, I said.
I tiptoed across to Partner Jon Cruzs cabin; his secretary asked me to wait as Jon ended a call. Bonus
day in Goldman altered the air in the office. Inside, people felt huge anxiety and excitement. Outside,
they had to pretend to be cool, like it was any other day. Of course, it was anything but that. Bonus is
what bankers work for, and the number defines whether you are good or not. A zero bonus or a
ridiculously low number could even mean a signal to leave the firm.
Jon Cruz would communicate the bonuses to everyone in the New York distressed debt team. I
had a base salary of 120,000 dollars a year. I felt a 30,000 number would be good, translating to three
months salary. Anything higher, say a thirty-five or forty, would make it a rainbow in my sky.
How you doing? Jon said, staring at his screen. He always tried to relax the person before he
shared the number. He had the magic spreadsheet with all the bonus data open on his computer.
I am good. How are you feeling? I said.
A bit like Santa Claus today.
I smiled. But only a little. In a partners office one always had to be poised.
Your first real bonus, right? he said.
I nodded.
How do you think you have done? he said.
I guess I will find out, I said.
He laughed. Well, people like you around here. The worst rating in all your reviews came
from you. You gave yourself a three; almost everyone else gave you a five.
I was speechless. Joy hopped through me like a rabbit as I realized people had noticed my
twelve months of slog.
So your bonus for the year is 150,000 dollars.
What? I blurted out. I shouldnt have but I did. What did he just say?
What do you mean what? Like it? Jon said.
Sorry, how much did you say again?
150,000 dollars. So your total compensation is 120,000 base plus 150,000 bonus. You made
270,000 dollars for the year.
I felt dizzy. I pressed my feet hard on the floor to keep my balance. Two hundred and seventy
thousand dollars, I repeated the number in my head to absorb it. It converted to 1 crore and 50 lakh in
rupees. Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm, I kept repeating to myself.
You also get a base increment. It is now 140,000 a year. Keep it up.
Well, yeah. Thanks, Jon. I will do my best, I said, my vocal chords not too cooperative.
You sound funny.
Sorry. It is a big number for me, I said.
Jon laughed. You deserve it. By the way, it is one of the highest bonuses at the associate level
this year.
Thanks.
But I must add that bonus numbers are confidential. Please do not share them with anyone in
the firm.
I understand, I said.
Good. Back to work now.
I felt lightheaded as I returned to my seat. I looked at Craig in the adjacent cubicle. I wanted to
high-five him. I couldnt. I simply smiled. I opened a financial model spreadsheet on my computer.
However, my mind couldnt focus. I had to share my bonus news with someone. India would be
asleep, I couldnt call home. I called Debu.
He didnt pick up.
Probably in a work meeting, I thought. I called Debu again after half an hour. He still didnt
pick up. I heard Jonathan and Craig make lunch plans with their significant others.
Where is Debu when I need him?
Finally, Debu called back after an hour.
Whats up?
Want to meet for lunch?
When? Now?
Yeah.
I am at work. Cant step out. Too much politics happening on an account.
I got my bonus number, I whispered to him.
Oh. Cool. Tell me.
I want to share it face-to-face.
You will tell me at home tonight?
Lets go out, I said.
Really?
Yeah. I will pick a place near your office. Come straight from work. 6.30?
I
12
booked Nerai, a highly rated Greek restaurant a ten-minute walk from the BBDO office. I sent
Debu a message after making the reservation.
Nerai, 55 East 54th St., 6.30.
I left work at 5.30 p.m. I had to walk to the South Ferry station and take the 1 train to reach
the restaurant. I decided to take a taxi instead. Heck, I deserved a twenty-dollar cab ride today. The
yellow New York taxi took the FDR drive, a highway along the east side of Manhattan. The cab
whisked me to 49th Street without a traffic signal. From there the taxi drove westwards towards
Nerais location.
I reached early and surveyed the restaurant at leisure; Greek paintings on white exposed-brick
walls. I scanned the wine list and ordered a bottle of Greek red wine.
I received a message from Debu.
Sorry, stuck at work. Running ten minutes late.
No issues, I replied.
Order something. Very hungry, he responded.
I ordered a watermelon and feta cheese salad along with a trio of dips. The food arrived.
Debu didnt. I kept waiting.
He entered the restaurant at 7 p.m.
I am so, so sorry, Debu said.
Its fine, I said. I stood up and we hugged.
He removed his long black overcoat and hung it on the back of his seat.
Too much work? I said as we sat down.
Just politics. On who gets credit for a campaign. Ever since my promotion I spend more time
managing politics than doing anything creative.
You are senior, after all. Thats what managers do.
Yeah, I guess. Oh, food is here. How is it? I am starving.
I have not tried. Was waiting for you.
Debu picked up pita bread and had it with the hummus dip. I ate some salad. His hunger
satiated after a few bites, Debu spoke again.
Anyway, how are you? Big day? he said.
I smiled. He continued, Not telling me on the phone. Dinner out on a weekday. You do like
your suspense.
Nothing like that. I wanted to share it in person.
He rubbed his hands together. So, what is it?
Jon called me this morning to his room. I told you about Jon, right? The partner.
Yes.
So he told me I had received good reviews from other people.
See, I told you. You are a star.
Well, its nice when a partner praises you.
Whats the number, babe?
I will tell you. . .
I cant wait anymore.
My bonus for the year is. . .dont tell anyone, okay?
Whom will I tell?
A hundred and fifty.
A hundred and fifty what? he said, sounding confused.
150,000 dollars.
150,000 dollars? he repeated my words.
Yeah.
You mean total compensation? You get 120 already, so thirty more bonus?
No. One-fifty is the bonus. Total comp is 270.
Debus mouth fell open. It stayed like that for a few seconds before he spoke again, one
deliberate word at a time.
You made 270,000 dollars last year? he said. His big eyes seemed even bigger.
Yeah.
Oh, he said in a low voice. Holy fuck! These banks.
Well, not everyone had this number. They told me it is one of the highest for associates of my
level. I had a five rating.
Nice, he said in a muted voice.
The waiter arrived to take Debus order. He opened the menu and took five minutes selecting
his dish; probably figuring out which item offered the best value.
One lamb kebab and one falafel, please.
The waiter left.
You okay with the order, baby? Wanted anything else? Debu said to me.
No. Though you seem more interested in the menu than listening to me.
No, no. Anyway. You were saying?
I smiled. That I had the highest bonus among the associates.
Thats nice, babe. I mean, I cant even imagine that kind of money. You know, I barely
reached an 80,000 compensation even after the promotion.
Why does he have to tell me his salary now? I already know it.
You are doing very well too, I said. I regretted saying it the next instant.
Why did I have to add a reassuring and patronizing, You are doing very well too? As if
telling a kid who is second in a race, You ran well too.
Thankfully, I dont think he noticed. I continued, Theres no doubt you are awesome at BBDO.
You are one of their best.
People are stupid in my company. You wont believe what happened in this campaign.
Okay, what just happened here? Why has it become about him? Isnt this, like, my big
moment?
The waiter arrived with a bottle of red wine. Debu looked at him, surprised.
I ordered Greek wine to celebrate my big bonus. A whole bottle! I signalled the waiter to
pour us two glasses.
Cool, he said. Nice.
Cool. Nice. Will this guy ever move on from these words to say something more substantial?
The food arrived. His face lit up.
This lamb smells so good. Baby, you pick the best places. Really, nobody picks restaurants in
New York like you do. This is so close to my office too. Will come here with my team.
Mr Debashish Sen, I do other things besides pick restaurants. Like make a ton of money for
a girl my age. Heck, I make a lot of money for anyone any age. I also got a top rating in my
reviews. Can you at least praise me a little for it?
This is yum. Try the lamb. Its so soft. Outstanding, Debu said, ten times more enthusiasm in
his voice than the nice hed uttered for my bonus.
I served myself. I wondered why I didnt feel ecstatic about my bonus anymore.
Why am I so keen for his praise? I have earned that bonus. Jon, one of the most senior
partners at Goldman Sachs, has recognized my work. Still, I want Debu to also acknowledge it.
Why? Why do we girls have this defect? Why do we need our men to praise and validate us in
order for us to feel accomplished?
How is it? Lamb is so tender, no? he said.
Its nice, I said. Fuck you is what I wanted to say.
So even if it is a defect, even if I do need him to praise me, why cant he? When he got a
promotion Id jumped up and down and thrown a surprise party for him. He cant get past the
tenderness of his lamb?
I kept silent and did not meet his eye. He had known me long enougha year and a half, to be
preciseto figure out I was upset.
I am proud of you, baby. So proud of you. You worked hard for it. I know it, he said.
That does feel nice to hear. Thanks, I said and squeezed his hand on the table.
I am sorry. I still cant get over the number. Its insane. You have less than two years of work
experience.
Distressed pays well. My deals made a lot of money. So a bit of luck too. But yeah, even I
was shocked when I heard it.
You make, like, three times as much as me? Mindblowing.
Why did he have to say it like that? Why compare? I wanted to tell him about my base
increment too. I dont know why but I decided against it.
Well, between two people someone will end up earning more. Some industries pay more, as
simple as that, I said.
Hmmm. . . He stabbed a piece of lamb with his fork.
Lets go on a nice vacation. Anywhere. Europe? Hawaii? I said.
He laughed. Feeling rich?
I am rich. We are rich. Lets go shopping this weekend. You will come?
Maybe. You told your parents?
I will. I will call mom when she wakes up.
They will be so happy.
I hope so. I wanted them to buy a Honda City. I think I will ask them to get an even better car.
You are a great daughter. They will be so proud of you.
Thanks. Debu, I have one question.
Yeah?
Are you proud of me? For real?
Yeah, I am.
We looked into each others eyes. Together, we had made a place for ourselves in this new
city. We had not only survived, but also thrived. He had been promoted. I had done well. We were
good for each other. I held on to his hand. He cleared his throat to speak. I wondered if he would say
something romantic.
Sorry, but are you going to eat that last piece of lamb? he said.
A hundred and fifty thousand dollars. So one-and-a-half lakh dollars, I said on the phone to my
mother.
Tell me in rupees, she said.
It is forty-five to the dollar now. So, around 70 lakhs.
Thats your bonus? I heard a vessel drop.
I am sending some money to your account. Please go shopping, I said.
You had a 70-lakh-rupees bonus? my mother repeated.
Yes.
In addition to your salary?
Yes.
What kind of work do you do anyway?
What is that supposed to mean?
I have never heard anyone earn that much.
I told you, I am in distressed debt. So we work with companies in trouble.
How can you make money if those companies are in trouble?
I laughed, We do. Is dad around?
Yeah, she said and shouted out for him. Listen. Come here. Your daughter made 70 lakhs!
Her voice could probably be heard across the whole colony they lived in. So much for
Goldmans confidentiality clauses.
I narrated the entire bonus story and calculation to dad. After a minute of stunned silence, he
spoke in an emotional voice. Even the SBI chairperson doesnt make that much. You are twenty-four
years old. My little girl has become such a big shot.
I found it difficult to hold back tears.
I am still your little daughter, dad. The one who held your finger on the way to the school bus
stop.
You are my sweetest little one, he said.
Remember you used to tell me to stand on my own feet? To not worry about anything else, to
just do the best I can? Thats all I did, dad.
I heard him sob. My father cries more than all the women in the house.
I am so proud of you, he said.
I love you. I miss you, I said.
Come home soon, he said.
I will. I will take a vacation at Christmas time. What do you want? Can I get you anything?
Get my little girl to me soonest.
I hung up the phone. I realized I had cried after a long time. Who knew 270,000 dollars could
make you so emotional?
C

heers! Jonathan raised a toast. To my amazing associates, Craig and Radhika.
We lifted our glasses. As per distressed debt tradition, the entire group went out for drinks on
the Friday night of the bonus announcement week. We had come to Harrys Café & Steak, a fiveminute
walk from the Goldman building. Harrys was a Wall Street institution, where senior bankers
and CEOs lunched and closed some of the biggest mergers and financial deals. Around twenty of us
from the Distressed Debt Group congregated in the bar area. Jon Cruz came only for a few minutes;
he chatted with senior MDs and vice presidents before leaving for the weekend at his Hamptons
beach house.
See you, guys. And enjoy yourself. Its on me, Jon said as he left the bar, leaving his credit
card behind.
People had invited their significant others, which meant wives, husbands, girlfriends and
boyfriends. Even I had invited Debu. I had finally gathered the courage to make him public to my
team. Until now my group considered me a geek, in a relationship with her financial models. Tonight
they would see my man.
White-gloved waiters passed around champagne glasses on silver trays.
Happy with your number? Craig said to me. Confidentiality clauses apart, bonus gossip was
just too hard to resist.
Its my first real one. Of course I am happy, I said, trying not to reveal too much.
I am sure they paid you really well. They love you here, Craig said. I wondered if he had a
hint of snark in his voice. I couldnt tell.
Hey, is that Jonathans wife who just arrived? I said, deflecting the topic. I pointed to the
Harrys entrance. I recognized her from the pictures on Jonathans desk.
Yeah, thats Clara, Craig said.
Clara, a tall American blonde who worked in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was wearing a
long purple dress.
You have someone coming too? I said.
Amanda is coming in a few minutes, Craig said. I remembered him mentioning his girlfriend
to me once. She was an aspiring actress, working in an off-Broadway theatre production.
How about you? Craig said.
I have a friend coming, I said.
Friend?
I laughed. Okay, boyfriend. Sorry, I just havent told anyone in the firm.
I didnt know you have a boyfriend.
Craig raised his glass and touched it to mine. I took another sip of my champagne.
I never mentioned him, I said.
Well, today well get to see him, Craig said, the boyfriend of our superstar associate.
I am still a lowly minion, I said.
You are good. I hate to admit it, but you are better than me. They will make you VP in six
months. You wait and see.
I dont know. . .
Amanda is here, Craig said in a higher pitch.
A gorgeous blonde with grey eyes entered the bar. Everyone in the group, men and women,
paused their conversations to look at her. She had curly golden hair, and her make-up was
impeccable, oxblood lipstick and smoky eyes.
She came and hugged Craig. For a few seconds, despite being an associate, Craig became a
superstar in the room.
I checked my phone.
Still stuck at work. Sorry, Debu had messaged.
Come soon. Everyone is here, I replied.
Craig introduced me to Amanda. The waiter gave us another champagne glass each.
I have heard so much about you, Amanda said.
You have? I said.
Craig mentions his deals, and how you are a tough negotiator. And that you are really good,
she said.
I laughed.
I am not. I get lucky sometimes, I said. Well, that is how I take compliments. I dont say thank
you. I just deny the compliment.
I love the colour of your skin, Amanda said.
Really? I wish I had yours, I said. She laughed. All the men around us noticed her laugh.
So I hear you are an actor? I said.
Yeah. Doing a small theatre part right now. Auditioning for television and movies. Its hard,
though. So I also work as a part-time piano teacher.
You are so pretty. I am sure it will work out, I said.
Too many pretty women in New York, Amanda said.
But you are the prettiest, Craig said and kissed her on top of her head. She giggled. Craig
introduced her to Jonathan and a couple of other VPs. All the men listened to every word Amanda had
to say.
I wanted to be Amanda. I dont know why. I scolded myself for thinking that way. Amanda
didnt have a real job. Amanda didnt know how to make financial models. Amanda couldnt close a
financial deal. Amanda didnt make 270,000 dollars a year. But Amanda is so hot. Amanda also has
men hovering around her, hoping to get her a drink. Where is my one and only man?
Debu, where are you? I sent a message again.
He didnt reply for an hour. Meanwhile, I met the better halves of everyone in the distressed
debt team. I finished three glasses of champagne. The wooziness in my head told me I needed to slow
down a bit.
Debu called me at 9.30.
Where are you, Debu? Everyone is leaving. Did you get my message? I said.
Yeah. Shit happening at work. I will tell you about it later.
I could hear crowd noises around him.
Where are you now? I said.
I came downstairs for a drink with my team.
Debu? You were supposed to come to my office party for drinks tonight. I wanted to introduce
you to everyone!
Stupid politics happening. I have to talk to people. I will come.
When?
In an hour?
Itll be over. Really, Debu? You had to do your office stuff on the one day I call you?
I got stuck. I cant tell you the backstabbing that happened here.
Debu, I said, my voice confident after the champagne, I dont care about your office right
now. You said you would come.
I thought I might. Listen, its just bankers, right? Its anyway not my scene.
Really? I am a banker too.
You are different. But they talk about money and deals and. . .
Debu, they are people too. Today, everyone has come with their significant others. I told
Craig you are coming. What do I tell him?
That I am stuck at work. What else?
So theyll think I made up my boyfriend.
What?
Nothing. Bye.
So should I come in an hour or not?
Dont. Drink with your backstabbing colleagues. Its okay. Bye.
I hung up. I picked up a glass of champagne and knocked it down bottoms up. Jonathan noticed
me.
Someone doesnt like to go slow and savour their French bubbly, he said.
Hey, Jonathan, I said.
Craig told me your boyfriend is coming. Is he here? Would love to say hi.
Hes stuck at work, sadly.
Oh, thats unfortunate. What does he do?
I dont know what the fuck he does, I wanted to say in reflex. His not showing up, the four
glasses of champagne and my realization I wasnt as pretty as Amanda had all added to my
frustration. I took a deep breath to compose myself.
He works in advertising. On Madison Avenue, I managed to say.
Oh, nice. The creative type.
I guess.
The banker and the creative. Interesting combination.
Yeah. . .wheres your wife?
He introduced me to Clara, who told me she couldnt believe how hard we all worked.
Forty-five minutes later the crowd frittered away from Harrys. In smaller groups, people left
for their own respective dinner plans. I had none. I walked out into the freezing cold and tried to find
a cab. I couldnt, given it was Friday night. I walked into the subway and looked at my phone. Debu
had not called or messaged. Dizzy with alcohol, I realized I had not eaten anything for a long time. I
came out of the train station. On the walk home, I picked up a pizza slice for myself from a small
takeaway deli. Even in my incoherent state, I wondered if that idiot Debu had eaten dinner. I packed
another slice for him, just in case.
I reached home. Debu was sitting on the sofa, hypnotized by ESPN.
What the. . .you are here? I said. He stood up and came forward to help take away the pizza
boxes and my handbag. I removed my winter coat and placed it on the hanger.
I just arrived. Ten minutes ago. Honest, he said.
You ate dinner? I said.
No, not really. Just some bar snacks.
Come, lets eat. I got pizza, I said.
Thanks, baby.
Dont baby me. Just eat.
What? You upset? Everything okay?
Is he a moron to ask?
I didnt respond. We sat facing each other at our small white dining table in the living room. I
took out the pizza slices from the boxes and put them on plates. Strings of molten cheese hung from
slices.
Looks yummy, he said.
I looked at the cheesy pizza slice and thought of Amanda. I bet she doesnt eat this stuff. No
wonder she looks like she does. My anger multiplied at the thought of eating this calorie-bomb
dinner. I pushed my plate away.
What, baby? Debu said, mouth stuffed with food.
I am not hungry.
Why?
I cant eat this. Too fattening.
You only bought it, baby.
Yeah, because I am stupid. Okay? And stop calling me baby.
Debu put his pizza slice down.
Listen, I know you are upset. I didnt come to your party. But I had a really rough day.
So it is about you now? I said.
They took me and two of my juniors off the Under Armor account.
What? How? I said. That was your account!
I told you. Politics. They called it a reshuffle. However, they stole it from me.
It all happened today?
They announced it today. But they had plotted against me for months. All planned.
Sorry to hear that. You still have other good accounts, right?
I am fucked.
I didnt know what to say. He had told me about the politics in his group for months. The
initial excitement Debu had had about working in advertising had disappeared. Many in his team often
excluded him from client meetings, a worrying sign.
What were you doing outside the office then? I said.
I was with my people. Trying to figure out what happened.
Did you?
They fucked me. What is there to figure out?
So you could have come for my office party instead of a drink with the boys after work.
Radhika, is your office party all you care about?
No. But I am wondering if you care about me at all.
What do you mean? So I didnt come to a stupid banker thing. Big deal.
I stood up and slammed my fist on the table.
It was not a stupid banker thing. It was my thing. I got a huge bonus this week. This was the
celebration. I wanted you to meet my team. I wanted them to meet you. Dont you get it?
Sit down. Can we eat dinner? he said.
I dont want to eat, I screamed.
Dont throw a tantrum. Are you drunk?
No, I said.
A bit high?
It doesnt matter. I can still think more clearly than you.
What?
You need to change your job. Every day you bicker about the politics. What are you going to
do about it?
I dont know.
Of course you do. Are you happy at your job?
Not exactly.
However, you are stuck there. So you need to go out there and apply again.
BBDO is prestigious. How to leave it?
Screw prestigious. If your group is not good, change. There is stuff happening in digital
advertising. You tell me about it so much. Find a job in that.
I cant. Its not easy. And they are start-ups and uncertain. . .
Whatever, Debu! So stay here, fine. But quit complaining so much.
I cant even share and vent with you?
You can. But at some point, do something about it. You dont, Debu. You dont do anything
about us. You dont do anything about the job you dont like.
What do you mean I dont do anything about us?
My mother calls me every week. She wants me to start looking at boys. I tell you every time
she says that. Do you ever take the hint?
He kept quiet. I had brought out all the touchy topics at one go.
You have seen how my career is going at the moment. If only it was okay, I would have
thought about it.
So do something about the career, Debu, I said.
I left the room. I took a shower and went to bed. I switched off all the lights.
Debu changed and slid into bed next to me. He placed his arm around me. I brushed it aside.
Come here, baby, he said.
Go to sleep, I said.
W

e made a ten-million-dollar investment. We will now recover thirty-six million dollars, I
said.
I made my final comments on the last presentation slide. We had invested in City Properties, a
Manhattan real-estate firm gone bust. Fortunately, the property market had improved after our
investment and we tripled our money.
Fantastic. We should sell. Now that is what I call a home run, Jon said. What a deal! Well
done, Radhika.
Jonathan and Craig guided me through it all, I said.
I came back to my seat. I called Debu. I wanted to tell him about Jons praise.
Hey, he said.
Whats up?
Just working on a pitch. I dont think we will get it, though. How about you? Debu said.
I am at work. Another deal closed.
You called for a reason?
Yeah, I said. However, at that moment I didnt want to tell him my success story. Perhaps it
was better not to share it than to do so and not get an enthusiastic response.
What is it?
Well, I said and wondered what to say next. Why was I hiding my success from him?
I just had a good day at work, I said.
What? Managed to make more money? He laughed.
He was being funny. Still, I didnt like what he said, or maybe it was just his tone. I ignored
his barb.
No just. . . I dont know. I just felt good. Grateful for what we have. We should be grateful,
no, Debu? We have so much. We have independence, jobs, health, family, a great city we live in and
love. We have love. Its a lot to be grateful for, isnt it?
Yeah, baby. We do. He sounded like he was about to yawn. Thats sweet. Anyway, I better
go back to my pitch.
Sure. Sorry I disturbed you.
Bye, baby, he said and hung up.
I went back to my screen.
Killed it. Craig came to my desk and high-fived me.
Dont we always? I winked at him.
Hi, this is Radhika Mehta from the New York office, I said. I had dialled into a conference call with
our Asian office in Hong Kong. Owing to the time difference the call had been scheduled late, at 10 in
the night. I took the call from home, sitting on the living room sofa. Debu read a book in the bedroom,
waiting for me to finish.
Hi, Radhika. This is Peter Wu from the Hong Kong office, a voice on the phone said.
Josh Ang from Hong Kong, came another one.
Jonathan from the New York office, Jonathan said.
I placed the phone on speaker mode so I could have my hands free. I had made myself a cup of
mint tea, and cupped it in both hands.
Jonathan introduced the deal.
We are dealing with a company called Luxvision, a spectacles and sunglasses manufacturer.
Radhika has already sent out the info memo. Currently in trouble, has no cash. The only assets are
some factories in China.
Goldman Sachs excelled in working together across offices. While the deal came from New
York, we would engage the Hong Kong office to help us out. Josh and Peter would visit the company
plants in China to see if the factories actually existed, and if they had any value.
Client is saying the factory is in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, I said.
Easy then. We could do a day trip, Peter said.
That would be good, I said. They are saying the factory is in the heart of town, and if we
close it down we could rezone into residential use and sell apartments.
As I finished my sentence, Debu tiptoed into the living room. I placed a finger on my lips to
signal him to be quiet. He nodded and pointed at the fridge. He walked up to the fridge and took out a
cup of strawberry yoghurt. He offered me some. I declined and sipped my tea. I smiled at how
domesticated we had become. He could be in the kitchen doing his thing. I could sip my tea and work.
I sent him a flying kiss. He smiled back.
I tuned back into the call.
Shenzhen is growing fast. Depends on the location and local permissions. What about the
workers? asked Josh, a VP in the Hong Kong Distressed Debt Group.
Debu sat at the dining table and ate his snack. The call continued on the speakerphone.
Two hundred workers. If we continue the manufacturing they stay, I said.
Though if we keep the business running it is only worth forty million. If we sell the land for
apartments, it is seventy million, Jonathan said.
Wow, Peter said, huge difference in value.
Yeah, so obviously we want the workers out and to explore the land sale option, I said.
Okay, give us a few days, we will make a visit and revert, Jon said.
Hope we get good news, I said.
The call ended. I hung up and shut my laptop. I noticed Debu.
Hey, you are still here, I said.
He scraped out the last of his yoghurt.
Yeah. I was listening to bits of your call.
Boring banker stuff, right?
Kind of. However, I think I sort of understood what is happening.
I stretched my arms above my head.
Its a new deal. Company gone bust, factories in China, I said.
Yeah, and you guys are trying to close it down, sell the land for apartments.
True. The factory is old but in a great location. China is growing fast, so this is the heart of
town now. Ready for bed? Its late.
No, wait, what about the workers? He came to sit on the sofa next to me.
They will have to be let go of. We will give them some compensation, I said.
And their families? What about getting new jobs?
Debu, they will figure it out. We will give them a few months salary as compensation. They
will find another job meanwhile.
Its not that easy. What kind of blatant capitalism is this?
I looked at Debu in shock.
What? I said. Seriously? Blatant capitalism?
You are trying to make the most money.
Well, yeah, that is my job. We invest money, so we want good returns on it.
But why do you have to fire people?
I rolled my eyes.
Is this a Bengali communist thing? Bengalis love communism, right?
I dont know. It just feels wrong, what you are doing to make money.
I am not doing anything wrong. We are doing what is legally possible and trying to generate
maximum value.
To make some rich Goldman Sachs partners even richer? What about the workers at this
factory?
Debu! Goldman Sachs has not created trouble for the workers. The company management
screwed up, borrowed too much money, ran their business badly and went bankrupt. Hence the
workers suffered. We are simply there to clean up the mess.
Like vultures. They could say they have come to clean up when they are actually feeding
themselves.
Thats not such a nice analogy, but yes. You could say that. Yes, even in the financial system,
you need the mortuary.
You make money doing this.
So? We also take huge risks. Nobody wants to touch these companies otherwise.
I finished my tea. I went to the kitchen sink and washed the cup.
Debu came up behind me.
You like your job?
I turned to him.
Yeah, Debu. I love it. I am good at it. Its exciting. I am learning so much. Its a great firm. I
am paid well. It kills me at times with work but I love it.
I dont know. Just doesnt feel right. I hope the job doesnt harden you.
Harden me? I said. What are you talking about?
You were this sweet, innocent girl when I met you. You had a soft side.
I still do. I am the same person. This is a job. I am more than that. I do it and come home to
cuddle with you. Dont I?
Yeah, he said, sounding unconvinced.
You applied to digital ad agencies?
I will. Soon.
I thought you said you would.
I will, Radhika. Dont keep pushing me so much. See, this is what I mean. You have become
hard.
I am just concerned, I said and threw my hands up in the air. I want you to be happy in your
job too. I want you to settle down so we can take the next step.
What step?
Id had enough of him faking ignorance. He knew exactly what I was talking about. With great
effort, I kept calm and spoke again.
About marriage. How many times do I have to bring it up? I said. I feel like I have to beg
you.
You dont have to beg me.
So how long do I fend off my mother?
I have told you. I am not ready.
My breathing became fast. I couldnt take this anymore.
We wont get married tomorrow, Debu. But we have to make some plans. I have to tell my
parents I have someone in my life, so they dont knock on every door in West Delhi to find a boy for
me. I want to tell them soon.
What do you want from me?
Tell me what is your plan for us. You want to get married in one year? Two years? Three
years? Something at least.
I think it is too soon to think about all this.
We have dated, sorry, lived-in for about two years. I think it is absolutely the time to at least
think about this.
I think it is not, Debu said.
I think it is, I said. We locked eyes.
And so you must be right. After all, you get the higher bonus, so what do I know, yeah? Debu
said.
I gasped. I raised my hand and pointed a finger at him.
What the fuck! What did you say?
Nothing, he said, probably regretting his statement.
Did you just bring my bonus into our marriage discussion?
No, I didnt.
You did. I dont even think about it anymore. Is it on your mind?
No, I dont care.
You sure? If I were the sweet and innocent girl you met, whatever that means, you were also
the sweet boy who talked about feminism while we walked in Manhattan. Remember? You will
inspire other girls? Women need to show men they are no less?
I dont care about your bonus. Okay? That is not what this is about.
So then what? Explain to me. Why is it wrong for us to discuss the future if we have lived
with each other for almost two years?
I am not sure, he said.
About what?
I dont know. Suppose we marry each other. We will start a family, have kids, right?
Yeah, of course, I said.
So I am thinking. I dont know. I had this idea of what the mother of my kids would be like.
Huh? Mother of your kids? I said. Sometimes, Debu talks such whacko stuff, I wonder what
they smoke in their ad agency offices.
Yeah. Its important, right? What kind of mother I want for my kids, Debu said.
Sure. I want a good father for my kids too. Can you come to the point?
So are you going to keep working like this or leave work once you have kids?
I dont know. I havent decided yet. Id like to work if possible.
You think you can?
Lets see. Will have to work it out. If I make as much money as I do I can afford full-time
help, take a house close to work, have our parents come. . .
He interrupted me.
See, this is what I am not sure about.
What?
When you talk in such practical terms.
What do you mean?
Like, if you are like this, in this hard job, fire the workers kind of role, would you even be
affectionate towards our kids?
What the fuck, Debu! I shouted.
See, now you are losing it. Then you say you want to discuss things!
This is not a discussion. You are talking bullshit. Making sweeping judgements.
I am not. Okay, I like you. I love you. But I want my kids mother to be at home for them.
Maybe I will be. If needed.
See, you are not sure. You have this hi-fi mega-paying job.
My job will have nothing to do with my commitment as a mother. Do you get it?
We stared at each other in silence for about thirty seconds. He finally spoke again.I dont
think I can do this. Really, I cant.
My heart stopped for a second. Did he just propose a break-up? Oh my God, had the only man
who ever loved the unlovable me threatened to leave me?
I turned my volume down and spoke in a calm voice. Debu. Whats the matter with you? Why
are you being like this?
He shrugged.
Work stress?
No.
Is it the call? Listen, this is the distressed debt business. Dont get so affected. Its business.
Not only that.
I checked the time. It was midnight. I had to wake up at 6.30 to prepare for an early morning
meeting.
Debu, calm down. Sorry I snapped at you. I will try to be understanding, okay?
I went up behind him and hugged him.
This is not the time to talk about such things. Its my mistake, I said.
Its fine, he said, disentangling my arms.
Shall we go to bed? I said.
He nodded.
We slipped under the sheets. I took off my nightsuit and drew him closer.
Im tired. Goodnight, baby, he said and turned away from me.
Within a few minutes he was asleep. I, on the other hand, kept awake all night, wondering
what I would do if the one man who loved me decided to leave me.
Since I hadnt slept I got out of bed at 5 a.m. I spent the next hour making breakfast. I made pancakes,
Debus favourite. I also cut fruit, boiled some eggs and made toast. I wondered why I was doing this.
Was it because I couldnt sleep? Or did I want to calm Debu down? Or to show I could be domestic
enough to be a good mother? Or did I want to prove that I could be sweet and innocent, which
probably translates into docile and submissive?
I wanted Debu to wake up and be happy. I wanted it more than the China deal or a bonus or
anything else. I scolded myself for feeling that way, but I couldnt help it. His words about me not
being potential mother material had shaken me up.
Wake up, Debu, eat the pancakes and please tell me I am lovable.
He entered the living room at 6.45. I had already laid out the plates and placed a jug filled
with orange juice on the table. I switched on the electric hobs and put a saucepan on it.
Wow, he said, rubbing his eyes.
Good morning, I said in my most cheerful voice.
What are you doing?
Making pancakes. You love them, remember? You want them with maple syrup or honey?
Maple syrup. Is it the weekend? he said in a puzzled voice as he dragged a dining chair out
to sit.
No, Wednesday. I just thought I would cook us something special.
On typical weekdays we would gobble down cereal and milk and rush out of the house.
I put a plate of blueberries, raspberries and blackberries in front of Debu.
Fancy, he said.
Berries are good for you. Start with this while the pancakes get cooked.
He waved his hands.
Dont you have to go to work? he said.
I do.
You had an important meeting in the morning, right?
Yeah. I will have breakfast with you and then get ready.
The smell of buttery dough filled the living room. The pancakes turned golden-brown. I
arranged two of them on a plate, drizzled maple syrup on them. I cut a banana into thin slices and
arranged them around the pancakes.
How about you? Debu said as I gave him his plate.
I am making more, I said.
Does he think I am less hardened now? I wondered. He ate in silence, perhaps wondering if
this was a dream. I made my pancakes and sat in front of him.
They are delicious, he said.
Thank you.
I should say thank you. You put in so much effort. What time did you wake up to make all
this?
Five. Just an hour earlier, I lied. I hadnt slept at all.
You do look tired.
Its okay. I will be fine. I cut a piece of pancake.
Radhika, I want to say something, Debu said.
I know you will say sorry. It is okay, I said to myself. He must feel guilty now after he saw
how much I care for him.
What?
This is really sweet.
Thanks. So are you. A sweet gesture for my sweet boyfriend.
Thank you, Radhika. This is really sweet but. . .
But what?
Today you are making breakfast like this. This is awesome. But I am not happy.
Not happy about what, baby?
Us.
Why? Is this about last night? We were both angry, I said. I found it difficult to swallow the
slice of banana in my mouth.
Its not just about yesterday or about being angry. I have been thinking about it for many days.
Weeks, actually.
Really? And you didnt discuss it with me? I said. I felt a little stupid about cooking all
morning.
There is nothing to discuss. I know I am not happy.
You are bored of me?
Dont be stupid.
So?
I am being calm, okay? But I have an image of the wife I want. The mother of the kids I want.
I am not judging you, but I think I want a housewife.
What? I said. My fork almost fell out of my hands.
Its what I have seen growing up. I go to work, make the money. Wife takes care of the home.
Simple needs, happy family.
What are you talking about, Debu? Didnt you say women could achieve anything today?
Didnt you encourage me when I had to apply for distressed debt?
I did. I still admire you. I respect all women who achieve big things. I think it is great. . .
But you cant be with them?
I dont know. Maybe not. Maybe I could. But you made me think about marriage and I did. I
visualized a future home. I would like my wife to be there for me and my kids.
And I cant be that?
Will you leave your job?
Why, Debu? Why do I have to leave it? I like it. Its rewarding and fulfilling to me.
What about the home?
What about the home? You are going to work too, right? Why cant I?
Oh, so you want to work and I stay at home?
I didnt say that, but why do I have to choose one of the two?
I get it.
What, Debu?
You make more money. I should quit my job, right, not the high-flying you?
Will you stop it? Stop calling me high-flying or whatever. When you do well I am happy for
you. Am I not? Why cant you be?
He looked at me once and then sideways. I let out a deep breath and spoke again, as calm as
possible.
Nobody needs to quit if they dont want to. We can still have a good happy family, I said.
Debu kept quiet. I could tell my words did not convince him.
Say something, I said, putting my cutlery down.
He remained quiet, continued to eat in silence. Tears welled up in my eyes. I wiped them with
a tissue. He placed his hand on mine.
Dont cry, he said.
Dont make me cry and then say dont cry, I said, my voice breaking.
Leave all this banking and morning meetings. You are stressing yourself out.
I am fine, I said as I continued to cry. I am fine.
You are this simple Indian girl. You need to love and be loved.
Yeah, I am, I said, sniffling as I composed myself.
I will take care of us. Dont you just want to be there for me and our future kids?
I checked the time.
Its 7.20. I really need to rush.
I walked towards the bathroom. Debu spoke behind me.
See. This is what you do. I am discussing something with you, he said.
I turned to him at the bathroom door.
I have a morning meeting. I am presenting a deal. I told you.
But I am discussing something important. Leave the meeting today.
I cant. I have to present the China deal.
I went into the bathroom, took a quick shower and changed from my nightclothes to a white
shirt and black trousers. When I came out Debu was still sitting at the dining table.
This is what I fear. Even as a mother this is what you will do. Then what? he said.
I didnt respond. I stared at him for five seconds. He cowered a little, nervous at what I would
do next. I reached the entrance door and opened it. I stepped out of the house. I glared at him one
more time and slammed the door shut.
W
15
hoa, big party night yesterday? Jonathan said. We sat in the meeting room waiting for others to
arrive.
No, I was at home. We had the China deal call, right? I said.
But your eyes. They are red.
I didnt sleep well, actually.
Deal stress?
Life stress.
Jonathan smiled.
I know the feeling, he said.
Craig, Jon and a few other VPs and associates from the Distressed Debt Group arrived in the
next few minutes. I presented the Luxvision deal to get everyones views.
I would get a local Chinese property developer involved soon, Jon said.
He was right. China had too many regulations; you needed a strong local partner to navigate
the system.
Sure, I said. Hong Kong office is visiting the factory. Will ask them to talk to a few
developers too.
I finished my presentation and sat down. Another team presented their deal. My head hurt from
lack of sleep. I was trying my best to pay attention to the speaker when my phone buzzed in my trouser
pocket. I ignored it at first. It buzzed a few more times. The meeting room was dark as the speaker
made a slide presentation. I slid out my phone and held it in my hand beneath the table. I had several
messages, all from Debu.
Radhika, I cant do this anymore.
Think whatever of me but this is not what I want.
Trust me. You are not an easy person to be with.
I want a simple life. I just want a simple Indian girl.
I want to break up. I will move out.
Will leave the rent for this month on top of the fridge. Bye.
My face froze as I stared at the screen. I couldnt react in front of the team. I clenched my teeth
so my eyes wouldnt stream.
Excuse me, I whispered to Jonathan next to me and stood up.
I need to step out, I whispered and tiptoed out of the meeting room to confront the darkness I
faced in my life.
I went to the ladies room and re-read the messages.
I called Debu. He cut my call. I called twice again.
Can you call me? I sent him a message.
He didnt respond. I came back to my cubicle, sat in my seat and covered my face with my
hands. Tricia, a sixty-year-old American secretary in our group, glanced at me.
You okay?
I nodded, my lips a flat line.
Just tired, I said with effort.
Are you going to call me? I sent a message again.
There is nothing to talk about, he replied.
I called him. He cut my call again.
Am busy, his message said.
What could be more important than this? I responded.
Can you leave me alone, please? came his answer.
My eyes welled up. I didnt want to cry in the office. I sucked in my breath.
We have lived together for two years. Is it that simple to end it? I sent him a message.
I should have ended it earlier, he said.
I called him. He picked up.
I have told you I cant talk. Stop calling me, please.
Can we talk later? I pleaded as my voice began to quiver.
I really have to go. Bye, he said.
That was that. My face red, I knew I had to leave the office before I disintegrated.
I am just going out for a walk, I called out to Tricia. Feeling a bit uneasy.
Fresh air will do you good, Tricia said.
Tell Jonathan to call on my cell if he needs me.
I stepped out of 85 Broad Street. The sun shone bright, taking away a bit of the chill. It was a
beautiful day weather-wise, but it felt like my worst day in New York so far. I felt like calling him
again, but resisted the temptation. I kept staring at my phone, hoping he would call me back. He
didnt.
I roamed up and down Wall Street a dozen times. I didnt have anyone like Debu in New York.
Sure, I had some friends at work and outside. However, I couldnt imagine this city without Debu.
Maybe he is just upset, I told myself. But he had seemed so cold and firm when he spoke to me.
I went back to work after an hour. I somehow finished the day. I didnt eat any lunch. I left the
office at 5 in the evening and took the subway back and reached home.
I switched on the lights of the living room. I went to the bathroom. I saw the counter didnt
have Debus perfume or his beard trimmer. The clothes-hook in the bathroom did not have any of his
clothes. I went to the bedroom, opened the closetnothing.
I felt like someone had kicked me in the stomach, hard.
No, this is just a nightmare. I didnt sleep all night so I am imagining all this.
I sat on the bed and stared at the empty closet. Then I cried. And cried. Till my eyes were as
empty as Debus cupboard.
Please, Debu. The house is so empty without you, I said.
I held on to the pole in the subway compartment. Debu had left home five days ago. I had
called him every day, trying to convince him to come back.
It is your house. You stayed there alone before me, right? Debu said.
Yeah, but now it is our home.
Its not. Its rented. Too much rent, if you ask me.
The train shook as it shifted tracks. I found it tough to balance myself.
You know what I mean, I said.
Its okay. You will get used to it, he said.
I cant. Please, Debu. Dont you miss me? I said. A part of me felt horrible for grovelling
before him like this. I teared up in front of everyone in the subway.
I am just a habit. Trust me, Debu said.
My stop has come. I will call you from home, I said and hung up. It gave me an excuse to call
him again after a while. Maybe he would be convinced this time?
How desperate are you? mini-me said. Yes, so I am a little desperate, but only for love.
Theres nothing wrong in being desperate for love, right?
At home I sat on the bed and called him again. He took my call. I heard noises in the
background.
Ive come out for drinks. With office people. Can we talk later?
Talk to me for two minutes, please, I said. The house felt lonely as hell. I needed him near
me, if not in person, then at least on the phone.
Come on chat. But only two minutes, he said. Of course, like an obedient slave, I agreed to
whatever scraps he offered me.
Wassup, he sent me a message.
How was your day? I replied.
Was fine. Is that what you wanted to say?
I cant sleep at night.
You should.
I beg you, come back.
Not that again, Radhika. Please. Have told you my decision.
What is my fault? Just tell me. I will change myself.
Its fine.
You want me to not work? Leave my job? Just say it.
Do whatever. Your life.
Debu, please!
Listen, office people here. Got to go. Bye.
He didnt respond after that. I opened the fridge, found a bottle of white wine, poured myself a
big glass. Then another and another.
I sent him a message in my drunken state.
I love you, Debu.
He didnt respond.
I will do anything for you. Nothing else matters, I sent another one.
Love you, Debu. More than anyone else, I continued my message barrage, as the wine inside
me meant I had no limits anymore. From desperate I had now moved to full-on pathetic. I saw the
typing. . . notification on WhatsApp. He was going to respond! Joy filled me in anticipation of his
response.
How do you say stop bothering me nicely? came his reply.
I poured myself a fourth glass. I needed to pass out and, well, not bother him anymore.
A
16
month after Debu left we closed the Luxvision deal. The China factory site did have realestate
potential. With the right local partners, we could see a good profit on the deal in two
years. We had closed a complicated deal. Jonathan wanted to celebrate.
I am buying a round of drinks. Harrys at 7, he said to Craig and me in the afternoon.
Craig did thumbs up from his cubicle.
Radhika, you on? Jonathan said. I gave him a blank stare. In the last month I had worked on
autopilot. I showed up at the Goldman office in the morning, sat in my seat, worked on my computer
and left post 8 in the evening. I wanted to reach home as late and as tired as possible. If I had spare
time or the energy to think, I would message and call Debu. He had stopped taking my calls or
responding to messages sometime back. But it didnt deter me.
I didnt socialize with anyone. I ate cereal with milk from tetrapacks for breakfast and dinner.
I skipped lunch. I spoke very little to mom. And when I did I asked her meaningless questions like
what she had made for dinner or what the temperature was in Delhi.
I slept no more than two to three hours a night. The rest of the time I stared at the bedroom
ceiling or watched American TV infomercials about slimming products promising eternal fitness and
happiness.
Hence, when Jonathan asked me a simple question, it didnt register with me.
You dont have plans this evening, do you? Jonathan said.
I shook my head. I didnt have plans. I will never have plans.
Come for drinks at Harrys then. Luxvision deal-closing drinks.
Sure, I managed to say.
Of course, heartbreak, alcohol and I are an explosive combination. Everyone celebrated the
end of all the hard work on the China deal with champagne and martinis. I drank my glass of wine to
kill the pain that just would not go away. I couldnt believe I loved this guy so much. I tried to find
reasons to hate him. How he used to sit watching TV doing nothing. How he would not shower on
weekends until the evening. How he would scan the menu to order the cheapest dishes. Yeah, he isnt
worth it, Radhika, I tried to tell myself. It didnt work. In fact, the things that annoyed me about him
made me miss him more. I slipped to one corner of the bar with my second glass of wine. I watched
my colleagues chat and laugh from a distance.
I listened to the song playing in the bar. It was Passengers Let her go.
You only need the light when it is burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow.
How did Passenger know what I was going through? God, I missed Debu. I wanted him to
hold me like he did every night. It meant more to me than any stupid job or stupid deal.
Whats up, Radhika? Jonathan came up to me. Come join us.
In a bit. Taking it easy. Plus, I like this song.
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast.
Jonathan raised his glass. I raised mine as well and touched it to his.
I could quit this job. Sure, thats what Debu wanted.
Enjoying yourself in the distressed group? Jonathan said.
I shrugged. I couldnt pretend to be cheerful anymore.
What? Jonathan was puzzled.
I dont know. I cant really say.
Even though Jonathan was a colleague, my boss and I totally should not have done this, I burst
into tears. Fuck, why do I cry so much these days? I swallowed hard to curb my tears. I am not
going to make a fool of myself in front of my coworkers.
Anything we can help with? Jonathan said, surprised.
I shook my head, keeping my gaze down.
If there is one thing Americans understand, it is not to invade someones personal space.
Jonathan figured something was amiss.
I am going to let you be. Join us if you want to. Okay?
I nodded.
Thanks, I mumbled.
I decided to quit my job. No deal or company or job was worth it. I only enjoyed all this when
I had Debu. I needed love. Unfortunately, Goldman doesnt hand out love at bonus time. I debated
whether I should tell Jonathan now. However, he seemed to be having a fun conversation with Craig. I
didnt want to spoil anyones mood.
I did bottoms-up on my third or fourth or fifth glass of wine. I tried to call Debu to tell him
about my decision to quit work. He didnt pick up. I decided to tell him face-to-face. I gestured to
Jonathan that I needed to go. He gave me an understanding nod.
I came out of Harrys. The wine made me feel weightless, airborne. At a florist kiosk on Wall
Street I bought a dozen dark red roses. I checked the time7.30 p.m.and hailed a yellow cab.
Tiffany on Fifth Avenue, please, I said.
I reached the Tiffany store just a few minutes before its closing time.
Rings, for men, I said.
The polite salesperson took out several gold and platinum rings. I chose a classic mens
platinum band.
Excellent choice. That would be 2,000 dollars, the salesperson said.
I took out my credit card.
Thank you. Would you like it gift-wrapped? he said.
Yes, please, I said.
I rushed out of the store and hailed another cab.
Brooklyn Heights, please.
The taxi took the FDR, crossed Brooklyn Bridge and entered Brooklyn. It took me forty
minutes to reach Debus building. He had moved back to his apartment with his old roommates. The
elevator of his building had shut down for temporary repairs so I climbed up the five floors to reach
his apartment. I was about to ring the bell but paused. I wanted to give him a complete surprise. I had
come with news of a resignation, a bouquet of roses and a ring. I wanted him. I was ready to be his
girl, just the way he wanted me to be. I lifted the potted plant outside his flat. I found the bunch of
house keys under it.
I opened the door. It was dark in the living room. I switched on the lights. I wondered if
anyone was home. Two bedrooms had their doors ajar. These belonged to Debus roommates.
I walked up to the third bedroomhis. I could hear music. Yep, Debu was inside. I knocked
twice. I dont think he heard it. Had he gone to sleep while listening to music? I checked the house
keys. I tried them one by one on the bedroom door with my right hand since I held the bouquet and the
blue Tiffany box in my left. One of the keys worked. I gently opened the door. I just wanted to slip
into bed with him. A tiny bedside lamp was switched on. It took me a second to process what I saw:
Debu and a white girl lay there naked, intertwined with one another. I couldnt breathe. In hindsight I
realize I should have shut the door and dashed out. Instead, I froze.
What the fuck. . . Debu said as he saw me.
I. . .I. . .sorry. . .sorry. . .
Oh fuck, the American girl said as she saw me. She had a large tattoo of a bird on her left
upper breast. She also had a pierced upper lip. I dont know why I stood there and noticed all this and
did not just run out.
Radhika? Debu said.
I started to shiver.
You know her? the girl said.
Huh? Debu said as he visibly wondered what to tell her. Used to. What are you doing here,
Radhika?
Nothing, I said. My face was on fire with embarrassment. What the hell was I doing here
anyway? With a bouquet and Tiffany box in my hand?
Then, in a second, I was gone. I turned around and ran out of his house. I dont know if he
came after me. I dont think he did. Not that I looked back. I simply ran and ran, down the stairs and
on the empty streets. I wanted to disappear into thin air. In the middle of the road I prayed for a cab,
but none came.
Dont cry, dont cry, dont cry, Radhika, I mumbled, rocking myself. I had to keep it together
until I reached home. Or at least until I found a taxi. My hands trembled, my knees wobbled.
Dont, Radhika, I said out loud even as I let go. My legs felt weak. I kneeled down on the
road and cried. I didnt just cry, I howled. A couple of people from the ground-floor apartments
peeped out from their windows to look at me. I didnt care. Where did I go wrong? I looked at the
sky. I am sorry, God, but what wrong did I do?
The image of Debu with the tattooed white girl wouldnt vacate my head.
An NYPD police car came up on the road and stopped near me.
You all right, lady? a cop spoke to me from inside the car.
I looked up at him and nodded.
You live here?
No. Tribeca.
You want to go home?
I nodded.
Come, we can drop you at the subway station.
I sat in a police car for the first time in my life. Five minutes later, he dropped me at the Clark
Street subway stop. I swiped my Metrocard and took the number 2 train to Chambers Street. Like a
corpse I reached home. Once inside, I sat on the sofa and looked at my hands; I still had the bouquet
and ring. I threw them on the floor and called home.
I miss you, mom, I said.
My mother sensed my sad, tired and devastated state.
What happened, beta?
Nothing.
Say what happened.
Nothing. Just homesick.
We miss you too.
I love you, mom!
Love you too, beta. Its late, sleep now.
Goodnight, mom.
I lay down on the sofa and passed out.
Hey, whats up, dealmaker? Come right on in, Jon said as I knocked at his office door.
I came in and sat down in front of him.
So, Jonathan told me, Jon said.
Yeah, I figured, I said.
Personal reasons? Jon said.
I nodded. I had sent in my resignation.
I had really tried to get back to normal. But New York wouldnt let me. Every street, every
nook, every inch of Manhattan made me think of him. Hell, I was such a wreck that every
advertisement hoarding (because Debu worked in advertising, you see) made my heart sink. Every
restaurant menu took me back to dinners with him. Even in my own house the kitchen, the couch, the
bed, everything screamed his absence. I had no plan for the future. I only knew I couldnt bear to be a
minute more in this city, where I had loved and lost the only man who loved me. I looked out of Jons
window. I saw the Hudson River, and the buildings of Brooklyn past it. Brooklynthe word itself
made my eyes well up.
I swallowed hard. I hate girls who cry in the office. Let alone in front of a Goldman Sachs
partner. Dont be a crybaby, I scolded myself.
Can I have some water? I said instead.
Sure, Jon said.
I poured myself a glass of water, took a slow sip but the tears slipped out anyway. I lifted the
glass higher to cover more of my face. It didnt help. My body shook as I started to cry. Some of the
water spilled on his table.
I am sorry, I said.
Its okay, Jon said. He passed me a box of tissues. If this were an Indian office, the boss
would have asked five times what happened, and would require all the gory details. In strait-laced
America, no matter what, they let you be, unless you want to share.
I hope you feel better, Jon said as I wiped my face.
I nodded.
Listen, I am not going to tell you what to do. However, you do know how much we value
you, Jon said.
Yeah, I said, staring at the glass before me to avoid eye contact.
So if there is anything we can do to keep you. . . If you need a long break or time off,
anything. . .
I shook my head.
What next? Jon said.
I have no idea. Leave New York. Maybe go home.
You want to tell me what the issue is? Jon said.
I kept silent.
Sorry, its not my place to ask. You dont have to tell me. Just wanted to help if I could.
I cant be in New York, I said.
Okay. Do you need to be someplace specific?
No. Just not New York. Too much baggage.
Jon nodded, leaning back on his ergonomic Herman Miller chair.
A relationship ended. I didnt realize I was this attached. Or it would hurt so much.
Hmm. . .
Jon was probably wondering how his favourite associate could be so foolish as to leave a job
and a city over a guy.
Now every corner of Manhattan reminds me of him, I said.
You could always move to Brooklyn, he said and smiled, pointing to the window.
He looked at me. Of course his joke had not worked.
He lives in Brooklyn now, I said in a plain voice.
Sorry, sorry. I was just being funny. Didnt work, obviously, Jon said.
You probably think I am insane. To throw away a career for a guy. That too a guy who is not
with me anymore.
I dont judge people. And I know you are not insane.
Thanks, Jon. Anyway, I want to thank you. I have had a wonderful experience. . . I said as he
interrupted me.
Wait. How about we keep you? But we transfer you?
Transfer?
To another office within the group.
Where?
Wherever we have offices. Your last deal was that China one, right?
Yeah. Luxvision.
So that deal needs to be monitored until we exit. You could do it from Hong Kong. That will
get you started. Plus, find new deals there. Asia is growing.
Hong Kong? I said.
Thats as far as it gets from New York by the way, on this planet, he said and smiled.
You are saying I could transfer to distressed debt in Hong Kong? I said.
I could make some calls, Jon said. See if they can accommodate.
Jon was being modest; a partner of his stature calling the Hong Kong office meant they would
oblige him in a second.
I know nothing about Hong Kong.
Lots of Chinese people, Jon said. Seems like a fun place from what I have seen during my
travels.
I already submitted my resignation. I sent you an email.
I have already deleted it, Jon said, clicking a button on his computer mouse.
Both of us smiled.
Thank you, Jon. Thank you so much.
I will call Neel. He is the partner there. You know him? Jon said.
Not much. He did a session during associate training, right?
Smart guy. I will talk to him. How soon can you move?
When is the next flight?
J
17
FK, please, I said to the cab driver.
I sat in a yellow cab to the airport. It was almost 5 in the evening. Finally, the movers had left
and I had surrendered the keys to my Tribeca apartment.
My new job offer had come through, with only one brief call with Neel as an interview. Given
Jons recommendation, Neel said this was a formality and more a welcome to Hong Kong call.
Human Resources sent me a new offer. Given the high rents in Hong Kong, they added a housing
allowance of 60,000 dollars a year to my base salary.
I had decided to quit and go back to West Delhi with a zero salary. Maybe I would have
yielded to my mothers badgering about getting married. I should have been serving tea and mithai in
trays to prospective grooms. Instead, I had a welcome brochure from the Goldman Sachs Asia-Pacific
Relocation Group in my hand. I might not have love in my life, but I did have Uncle Goldman Sachs
taking care of me. The brochure said I would be staying at the Shangri-La Hotel in Hong Kong until I
found a new apartment.
The cab passed the Tweed Courthouse near the Manhattan side entrance to the Brooklyn
Bridge. From a distance, I could see the skyscrapers of the Financial District. Even though I had
wanted to get out of New York at the earliest, I felt a tinge of regret. I had become attached to the city
of my firstsfirst job, first boyfriend, first independent home and, well, first break-up.
Could you stop here for a second, please? I said as the cab reached the bridge.
The driver slowed down the cab.
Can I walk across the bridge? You can meet me on the other side.
The entire bridge? That will take you half an hour.
I have time. Can I have your number?
He gave me a business card with his name and number.
I am gonna have to keep the meter on, he said, chewing gum.
Sure, I will call you when I reach the other side.
I stepped out of the taxi and climbed the steps up to the pedestrian walkway of the bridge. The
Brooklyn Bridge is an old cable-stayed-cum-suspension bridge in New York City. Completed in
1883, it connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River. Around a mile
long, it has a pedestrian walkway in the middle, above the automobile lanes.
If you have seen movies set in New York, you would have probably seen scenic shots of the
Brooklyn Bridge. I began my walk. The orange-coloured sky at sunset and Manhattans skyline on my
left seemed like a perfect last memory of the city. The peak hour traffic passed below me. I noticed
that the bridge with its trusses resembled the Howrah Bridge in Kolkata.
Pain singed my heart; Kolkata reminded me of Debu. I had told myself to not think of him.
Thats what sucks about love. It takes away your control over your thoughts. Any trigger, anything that
somehow could be connected back to Debu, would spark a fire of memories inside me. I just wanted
my last walk in the city to be peaceful. Alas, no such luck. I approached Brooklyn. I wondered if
Debu would be home already. Or if the tattooed white girl would be waiting for him. One of his
roommates had told Avinash, who then told me, that the girl was a waitress at Chipotle, a Mexican
fast-food chain. I didnt ask further. I wondered if he loved her so much that he never thought of me.
Or did he miss me?
Focus on the walk, breathe, I told myself. Why doesnt the brain listen once in a while? Why
cant it just take in the beautiful view? Isnt it the brains job to figure out a way to avoid pain? So
why is it only generating thoughts that kill me?
I reached the midpoint of the bridge. Tourists took pictures of the panoramic scenery. I took out
my phone to take a last snapshot of New York as well. After I clicked the picture, I opened my
WhatsApp. I dont know why I did it, but I checked Debus profile. He had the same picture as
always, of him posing next to The Lake, in Central Park. He was online. I took a deep breath, typed
Hi and pressed send.
He read my message but didnt respond. I didnt want him to think I was chasing him again. I
typed another message.
I am leaving New York.
You know the most annoying thing in the world? When it says typing. . . on WhatsApp but
then the typing. . . vanishes. I have a cab waiting. Debu, say what you have to say fast, please, I
said in my head.
Good came his response. Could he be any meaner? So okay, I had barged into his apartment.
I had even entered his bedroom. Sure, he was mad at me. But did he realize that the person hed lived
with for two years was leaving the city, the country or even the continent?
I meant I am leaving now. On my way to the airport.
He then did another mean thing you can do on WhatsApp. He sent me a thumbs-up smiley. Who
made that stupid smiley? What the fuck is that thumbs-up supposed to mean?
Like an idiot I continued to send message after message. All in the hope of a scrap of emotion
or validation. This man had the ability to make me feel wretched in seconds.
I am moving to Hong Kong.
Great. More money for you, I hope.
Really? He had to say that? I decided to ignore his snide comment.
So I am leaving New York forever, I said. I meant, I love you so much, this is what I have to
do to get over you. And I am so lonely and scared, can you please say something nice before I go to
a strange country, I beg you.
He did not respond for a minute. I checked the time. I had to reach the other end soon. I sent
him another message to prompt him to respond.
Just wanted to let you know. No chance of me bothering you now, I guess, I said. I am
grovelling now. At least say something nice.
Thank you for that. This way you can achieve your goals. And I can find someone caring, he
said.
That hurt. I gripped my phone tight, to prevent my fingers from typing again. I like to humiliate
myself, but I guess I had to set limits on how much.
No more, I said to myself. I took a deep breath. On an impulse, I tossed my phone into the East
River. Tourists around me gasped in disbelief as I tossed a working iPhone into the water. The next
minute I felt stupid. However, it ensured I didnt have a phone on me for the next few hours,
particularly at the airport. Of course, I could have simply deleted his contact. However, that wouldnt
stop me from expecting him to respond or from checking my phone every two minutes. No, I had to
toss that humiliation device into the river. People with little emotional self-control must take drastic
steps. I resumed my walk towards Brooklyn. As I stared at the wooden pathway, a question crossed
my mind.
Damn, how will I reach the cab driver without my phone?
I did manage to find the taxiby borrowing a tourists phone and using the card the driver gave me.
In twenty minutes we reached JFK airport.
Terminal 7 please, Cathay Pacific, I said to the driver as we approached the airport
driveway.
I checked in and waited to board in the Cathay Pacific lounge. A part of me felt glad I had lost
my phone. If I didnt I would be calling Debu right now. I thought about his curt responses. Couldnt
he have said, All the best, baby. I am sorry it ended this way? He could have even sent a Lets be
in touch. I still care about you. Was I so horrible? Was he so relieved to be rid of me?
Lost in these thoughts, I boarded the Cathay Pacific plane with its dark-green interiors. I sat in
the plush business-class seat, courtesy of my bank, the only one in the world that seemed to care about
me.
A pretty Chinese girl in a fitted red cheongsam dress came up to me. She offered me a glass of
champagne. I declined. I had no reason to celebrate. I looked out the window as the plane started to
taxi for its long sixteen-hour flight. My eyes filled with tears. I felt lost in my luxurious surroundings.
Too sad to stay. Too sad to leave. Perhaps this is how it will be from now, I thought. I will remain
sad forever. The plane took off. I continued to cry as New York became smaller and smaller in my
window.
The flight attendant noticed my tears. After the seatbelt signs went off, she came up to me with
a hot towel and tissues. I used the hot towel to wipe my face. The heat felt nice on my skin.
Thank you, I said.
Would you like to eat something, maam? she said.
I shook my head.
Maybe just the starter? We also have a lovely carrot-and-ginger soup.
I nodded. She pulled out my tray table and placed a white cloth on it. She took another cloth
napkin and placed it on my lap. She brought me a tray of food. It contained fresh salad, soup and
brown bread. I had not eaten all day. I finished everything on my tray.
Later, she offered a raspberry pudding for dessert. After I ate it all up she brought me hot
peppermint tea. I enjoyed her full attention.
Is this the kind of wife men want?
Ready for bed? she said.
I nodded. She adjusted my seat and converted it into a flat bed. She placed a white sheet and
pillow on it. As I lay down, she draped a quilt over me. I realized something. Debu wasnt the only
one. I also wanted someone like this lady to take care of me. Why cant women get a wife?
I
18
wiped a tear from the corner of my right eye. A bit of kajal came away on my finger. I sat down
on the leg raise machine. Debu continued to look at me with an apologetic expression.
I have not forgotten anything, Debu. But I dont need to be reminded of it either.
I am sorry, baby, he said and touched my elbow. I pushed his hand away. I stood up to leave.
I need to go. And you have to stop calling me baby.
I tried to walk past him. He blocked me.
What? I said.
Please. Stay. Listen to me. Please.
Whats the point? I have literally a hundred people waiting upstairs.
My phone rang.
See, it is my sister, I said.
Tell her you need ten more minutes.
What for? I placed a finger on my lips to signal Debu to be quiet and answered the call.
Yeah, didi. I went to the washroom. . .no, not in the room. . .I am coming. Give me five
minutes. . .no need to come fetch me. . .I will come on my own.
I hung up. I saw Debu. His eyes, his dreamy puppy-dog eyes, continued to look at me.
What? I said.
I made the biggest mistake of my life, Debu said.
It doesnt matter, I said. Even though I said it didnt matter, I did feel good inside. At least he
finally felt some regret.
You were the best thing that happened to me. Seriously, Debu said.
Why? That white chick didnt work out?
Who?
That girl. Who was with you when I. . .
No. We tried. There was no intellectual match.
Oh, you care about a girls intellect too now?
Of course I do. I always did. That is why I liked you.
That is also why you dumped me.
I told you. I made a mistake. A big mistake. Monumental mistake.
You said my job would harden me. What else did you say? You had a vision for the mother of
your kids. You wanted me to quit working.
I am sorry. I became a little insecure.
Oh, really? Now you realize it! You werent a little insecure. You were monumentally
insecure.
I realized my volume had increased. A body-builder-type white guy stared at us through his
bicep curls.
Do you have any idea how much I loved you? I said.
He kept quiet, his head down. I noticed the thick curls on his head. I continued, I was ready to
quit my job. Just to make you happy. I came to Brooklyn to tell you I would resign. I wanted to
propose to you that night. You wanted a simple family. I was game. I even bought a ring.
You did? he said, looking up, his eyes wide.
I shook my head.
All pointless, Debu. My family is upstairs. Can I go now? And I suggest you leave Goa soon
too.
He grabbed my hand. I extracted it, almost in reflex.
What are you doing, Debu? My would-be in-laws are in this hotel.
I know. I just. . . And then he did something I have never seen him do. He started to cry.
Puzzled gym trainers must have been wondering why a grown-up man was crying in their gym even
before he had begun to exercise.
Dont make a scene, Debu, I said. I tried to remain unaffected, but to see him cry like this
choked me. He knelt on the floor.
Please, baby. Please, I beg you, Debu said. I have come all the way from New York.
I looked around. The last thing I wanted was anyone noticing us.
I held Debu by the shoulders.
Get up, please. I pulled him up.
I handed him one of the hand towels kept in the gym. He used it to wipe his face and compose
himself.
Stop being the victim here, Debu. Remember how you treated me? You would not take my
calls. You were rude on messages.
He nodded his head vigorously.
You were, you were. . . I searched for the right word.
An asshole. Yes, he said.
Good. So now, you are doing these tears and trips. But how did you treat me earlier? Even on
my last day. I still remember. You sent me a thumbs-up smiley. Thats it.
I said I will miss you ten minutes later. You didnt reply.
You did?
Yeah. Why didnt you reply?
I tossed my phone in the river.
What? I shook my head and threw my hands up.
No point digging up the past.
Why not? After you, I tried to be with several people. I dated other girls. Nobody connected
with me like you did. Nobody had the complete package of qualities like you. You are smart, caring
and humble. You are easy to live with. You kept our little apartment so well. I still remember how you
gave me that surprise party when I got a promotion. Which girl does that?
Anger filled me. I wanted to slap him. My arm tightened.
What? You want to slap me, right? Do it.
I looked around. Everybody seemed busy with their own exercises. I lifted my hand and
slapped him hard across his cheek.
Ow! he howled. You actually slapped me?
I flexed my fingers; my hand hurt.
Now you tell me all that? You couldnt say it earlier? I gave you surprise parties, yes. But
how did you react when I got my first bonus?
Like a dick.
Exactly. Where did your feminism go?
My feminism didnt go anywhere. My masculinity did. I told you, I felt insecure. How can my
girl make three times as much as I do?
So what? I work in a bank. It pays better. You chose your passion, advertising. Why did you
have to compare? Wasnt it all our money?
My phone rang again. This was my mother.
Bye, Debu.
Two minutes. Please.
I cut the call.
What? I said.
I didnt value you. I am sorry. I had to lose you to realize how amazing you were. Like that
Passenger song. Let her go.
I knew that song. I had cried to it. I wanted to tell him but I didnt. I took deep breaths to not
lose it again. I had to remain serene for dinner, like a good Indian bride should be after bhajans.
Well, too bad. Anything else? Have a safe trip back otherwise, I said.
I have a plan, he said.
Plan?
Yeah. Swap the groom.
What? I said, my hands on my hips.
I understand you have your entire family here. You cant stop the wedding. But I am ready. I
want to marry you right here in Goa. I will call my parents from Kolkata, maybe some close relatives
and. . .
I cut him short.
Hold on there. What did you say? We get married? Right here?
Ask yourself, Radhika. I am your first love. Sure, I made a mistake. But I want to amend it. I
want you more than anything else in the world. So I can get married now. Your parents will freak, but
at least theyll know it is not a cancelled wedding. The boys side, yes, they will be upset too. But I
will handle it.
You have really thought it all out.
I had time on the long flight here. I realized I couldnt lose you at any cost.
And what makes you think I want to marry you?
Because I know. Deep down, you still have feelings for me. I will keep you happy, Radhika.
Do whatever you want. Just be with me.
I sat back on the leg press machine again. I covered my face with my palms; this wasnt
happening. No, I couldnt be facing this. This is a horrible dream, I told myself. When I remove my
hands from my face, Debu will be gone.
However, he stood there, looking at me like he did years ago when we first fell in love.
Just agree and I will handle everything else.
This is not a joke, Debu. My entire family, Brijeshs entire family, is here.
Brijesh is the person you are getting married to?
Yes, I said.
Did I just show that I was considering Debus idea? Was it just about how to manage the
family embarrassment now?
I am here for you. We can go back to how we were. Remember our tiny apartment?
Of course, I said, my voice softening.
My phone rang again.
They will send search parties for me!
I will wait for you. Will you think about this and let me know? Debu said.
I dont know. My mind is not working. I better go.
I am in the resort across the road. They didnt have rooms here at the Marriott.
I know, I said. Thank God for small mercies.
Day four
How are you? Brijesh smiled at me. We were on the sandy beach for an early morning stroll. When
hed asked me out on a morning walk the previous night, he said he wanted to catch up before the
relatives woke up.
Sleepy, I said and yawned. I checked the time: 6.30.
I am sorry. I shouldnt have made it so early, he said.
No, its fine. Once people wake up, chaos begins, I said.
I had worn pink lycra leggings and a white top. He wore a grey tracksuit. We were both
barefoot. Occasionally, the waves would splash high and run through our toes.
Didnt sleep enough? he said.
Four hours. It is okay, I said. Sleep deprivation delayed my reactions to recent events. Debu
had flooded me with messages all night, right from reminding me of our first date to asking me how
long before I took a decision.
The bhajans were wonderful. Such a great idea, Brijesh said.
My mothers idea, actually, I said.
Yeah, it just makes the whole event more pure, Brijesh said.
Sure, especially pure if the bride goes to the hotel gym to make escape plans with her exboyfriend.
Mehndi today then? Brijesh said.
Yeah, I said. Not much for you to do.
Oh, they have plans for me too. They will apply turmeric paste all over me.
Marinating the groom before the roast?
Both of us laughed.
He held my hand; I didnt protest. How could I? We were getting married. He clasped it
tighter, and although it felt a bit weird, I held his hand too, not merely leaving my hand in his. I
wanted support, perhaps, to decide what I needed to do.
You happy? Brijesh said.
I looked at him. His smile was childlike. He was visibly thrilled to hold my hand.
Yes, I am happy, Brijesh, I said. To make others feel better, women lie about their feelings all
the time. Its amazing how easily it comes to us.
So I told you about Menlo Park, right? I thought we could take a place there or near the
Goldman office. That way, at least one of us can be home quickly if necessary.
Sounds good, I said absently.
Although, if my start-up happens, I dont have to be in Menlo. We could be near your office in
that case. If I ever take that step, though.
I am sure you will, I said.
He shrugged his shoulders. The morning sun was on our faces. I had worked hard to remain on
a plan of regular diet and exercise before the wedding. I hoped I didnt look fat in my tight workout
clothes.
You are beautiful, Brijesh said, as if reading my mind.
I dont know why, but I laughed. I suck at receiving compliments anyway, and laughing in the
compliment-givers face is another way of deflecting them.
Did I say something wrong? Brijesh said.
No, I said and smiled. Thank you.
I have never said this to a girl. Ever, he said.
I looked at him. He looked like an earnest schoolboy, even though he could work the worlds
most complicated computers.
Well, I should be flattered then, I said.
We walked in silence. After a few minutes I checked my phone. It had a message from Debu.
Good morning, beautiful.
Who is it? Brijesh said.
Huh? Nothing. Didi woke up and is looking for me.
Really?
Yeah, lets go back, I said.
I thought we could have breakfast outside. At a beach shack. Just us, Brijesh said.
My phone buzzed again.
I love you, Debu had sent another message.
I released Brijeshs hand. I couldnt hold my groom-to-be with one hand and use the other to
check love messages from my ex.
We better get back, I said.
Anything happened?
I nodded. Brijesh didnt say anything after that. We walked back to the hotel. I kept a little
distance from him, so he couldnt hold my hand again. I held my phone tight and ignored any incoming
messages.
We reached the hotel elevator for my wing. I turned to him before I stepped into the lift.
Sorry, Brijesh. I know youre making an effort so we get to know each other better. I am
trying too. But somehow I just cant right now. Too much on my mind.
He smiled.
We will have plenty of time after marriage.
You are very sweet, I said.
He blushed as he hid his smile. Oh, it would kill me if I had to stab him in the back and run
away with someone else. Why couldnt Brijesh be an evil groom? Like the ones in the movies, the
ones who shoot innocent pigeons for fun?
I waved him goodbye.
See you at mehndi, he said.
No boys allowed there, mister, I said.
He smiled. I gave him an extra-wide, almost fake smile in return. Thankfully, the elevator door
shut. I heaved a huge sigh of relief as Brijesh disappeared from sight.
God help me, I said as the lift started to climb up the floors.
P

ut your phone aside, Radhika didi. How will he apply the mehndi? Sweety, my eighteen-yearold
cousin, said.
Four mehndiwallahs had set up stalls in the function room. Suraj had also arranged for a
bangle stall. The function room turned into a stock exchange of hotly traded gossip as women of all
ages assembled to apply mehndi and choose bangles. Waiters served hot masala tea along with snacks
like mini samosas and jalebis. As women waited their turn, they discussed topics ranging from the
latest lehenga trends to the creepiest uncles to who slept with whom in Bollywood.
I had a dedicated mehndiwallah called Puran Singh. He claimed to be an artist who only
specialized in bridal mehndi.
You would not have seen any dulhan with such beautiful mehndi, Puran said as he went to
work at a slow pace. The other mehndiwallahs worked at triple the speed with my cousins.
I can use the phone with one hand, see, I said to Sweety.
I used my right hand as he applied mehndi on my left.
Who are you messaging? Brijesh bhaiya? Jyoti, my second cousin, said. Everyone burst into
laughter.
Are you excited about the first night? What will you do? Sweety said. Everyone giggled
again.
My sister is innocent. Please dont corrupt her, Aditi didi said. According to her, I was
clueless about men. It was partly my fault. I hadnt told them about my relationships. I couldnt.
Neither Aditi didi nor my mom would get it. For them relationships meant one thingto get married
as fast as possible.
Saloni, Aditi didis best friend, held my chin.
You know what will happen on the first night? Do you have any experience?
Well, does having regular sex for several years count?
I shook my head. I could at least try to be the demure bride.
Come, I will tell you, Saloni didi said. She brought her mouth close to my ear.
Just drive him crazy. Tear off all his clothes and drive him crazy, she whispered.
It was supposed to be an outrageous statement. I was supposed to get embarrassed. I played
the part and blushed, so my cousins and friends could enjoy the show. I hid my face in Saloni didis
shoulders. I dont know why I did that. Just to entertain the crowd? Or to make them believe I was
actually innocent? Why do I have to be this fake?
The girls finally left me alone as their turn came with the other mehndiwallahs. I checked my
phone.
Baby, I am waiting, Debu had sent me on WhatsApp.
I know, I replied.
Its not that difficult. Just tell them you have another guy.
Whom do I tell?
Anyone. Your mother. Your sister.
Is this a good idea, Debu? I am really confused.
Its love, baby. Its meant to be confusing. Even I was about you. But now I am sure. I want
you to be Mrs Radhika Sen.
The name Mrs Radhika Sen made me squirm a little.
Madam, dont move so much, the mehndi guy said as I furiously typed with my right hand.
Not sure if I will change my surname.
Dont, he said.
I didnt respond. He typed after a minute.
Is that a yes, though?
I dont know, Debu. I am at my mehndi. Hard to use the phone too.
Baby, please, just say yes.
I put the phone aside.
I have been doing this for twenty years. You have the most beautiful hands of them all, Puran
said.
You say this to every bride? I said.
He looked at me and smiled, showing his paan-stained teeth.
Actually, yes.
I smiled back, shaking my head. My phone buzzed again.
Your left hand is almost done. Will need the other one soon, Puran said.
I nodded and checked my phone. The message had not come from Debu. It came from an
unknown international number. It began with +852, the code for Hong Kong.
Hi. Its Neel, the message said.
Madam, can I have your other hand? And dont move your left hand now. It has fresh mehndi,
Puran said.
Give me one minute, I said to the mehndiwallah.
Hi, Neel, I replied.
I heard you are getting married. In Goa.
Yeah.
Cool. Office people told me.
Yes. Whats up?
I am in Sri Lanka. Due diligence on a deal.
Okay.
Can I call you?
Radhika, focus on your mehndi or I will kidnap your phone again, Aditi didi said.
Ten seconds, I implored Aditi didi.
Too caught up right now, I typed back.
I pressed send. I put the phone aside on the cushion next to me. Puran held my right hand and
started to apply mehndi. He had spent two hours to make an intricate floral pattern on my left hand.
He needed the same time on my right.
My phone screen lit up on the beautiful cushion. I had another message.
Its urgent, Neel said.
I couldnt respond. I did not have any hand free.
He called. I used my pinkie finger to disconnect the call.
He sent another message, Listen, please talk to me for two minutes.
I couldnt. How do I tell him? He continued to send me messages, one after the other.
Dont move, Radhikaji, Puran said.
Neel continued with his messages.
I have a lot to tell you.
Been meaning to reach you sooner.
Are you going to reply at least?
I cant, I screamed in my head as Puran Singh drew an intricate circle on my right palm with
henna paste. The messages kept popping up.
You know what. This cant be done on chat.
Or even on a call.
Some things are just better discussed face-to-face.
So maybe I should do that.
Yeah.
Okay then. You are reading my messages but not responding.
So yeah. Face-to-face.
I sat there, exasperated and helpless.
Bhaiya, can you hurry up? I said to Puran.
It is shaadi ki mehndi. How can you hurry it up? You saw your left hand? I have to make this
equally beautiful.
I saw my phone flicker every few seconds.
Damn, I mumbled to myself. I had to respond before he did anything crazy. I had enough on
my plate already.
There you go, Puran said after two hours.
Thank you. Thank you so much. Can I go now?
Yes. But you wont give me any special gift?
I gestured to my sister. She gave the mehndi guy a 2,000-rupee tip. He smiled and folded his
hands to say thanks.
Dont wash your hands for four hours. Will make the colour last beyond the honeymoon,
Puran said.
Did you say four hours? I said.
I told my cousins I needed to use the restroom. I ran up to my room. Aditi didi followed me there.
How will you use the restroom with your hands like this? Come here, she said.
Aditi didi unfastened my salwar drawstrings.
I will come in with you? she said, pointing to the bathroom.
Fuck it. I am washing my hands, I said.
No, wait. . .
I ran into the bathroom. I placed my hands under the running water at the washbasin tap. The
mehndi stains were dark orange rather than the deep dark brown I could have achieved had I shown
more patience. However, I needed my fingers. I had to respond to Neel and prevent another layer of
chaos in my life.
Hey. Sorry. Couldnt respond earlier, I hurriedly typed a reply.
Its okay, Neel replied in an instant.
Whats up? I said.
He called me. I picked up the call in the bathroom.
Hi, I said.
Its been so long since I heard your voice.
Whats the matter, Neel?
How are you?
Can you hurry up, please? What is it?
I have something important to tell you.
What?
Like I told you, it is better in person.
Not possible. Just tell me.
You are in Goa, right? Which resort?
Neel, I am with 200 people here. Can this wait?
Which resort? Or should I call your office to find out?
Just tell me what you have to. I am at my wedding. You are on due diligence.
Yeah, at some remote copper mine in the south of Sri Lanka. Dont ask. No flights from here.
Wait, let me check my computer.
Aditi didi knocked on the bathroom door.
Seriously, Neel, I have to go. Bye.
Okay, bye. Congratulations, he said.
Oh well. Whatever. Bye now.
I came out of the bathroom.
What? You washed away the mehndi? Aditi didi said.
Its still a strong colour, I said. I began to change into my workout clothes.
Its your wedding mehndi. You couldnt be patient for a few hours?
Sorry, didi. I am not as nice a girl as you. Okay? I said, irritated.
Arey? Why are you snapping at me? And why are you changing into these clothes?
Sorry for being rude, didi. I just need to get some air. I am going for a walk on the beach.
With whom?
Alone.
Why? I will come with you.
No, didi, I said, my voice firm. I want to be alone. No Brijesh. No you. No mom and dad.
Can I get an hour? I need to clear my head.
Aditi didi came and patted my cheek.
What happened?
Nothing. All this wedding stuff is just too much. I need an hour.
She gave me a hug.
Go. I will cover for you.
I walked on the beach outside Marriott. I continued further north until I had left the hotel behind. I saw
that Brijesh had messaged me. I decided not to open it. I couldnt deal with anyone. I focused on the
orange sun, which sank deeper into the water every minute. My mind was filled with thoughts. How
did Neel find out? Oh well, it isnt difficult if you work in the same firm, even if in different offices.
Whats he doing in Sri Lanka? Making even more money, I guess. Why did he call me? Why didnt
he tell me what he wanted to? Whats with all the suspense?
Radhika, a voice from behind startled me.
Debu? I turned around. He wore a white printed T-shirt and Bermuda shorts. He came
running to me, huffing and puffing as he caught his breath.
Are you following me? I said.
No. I stay in that property, he said and pointed to a hotel building at a distance.
Dont stalk me.
I am not. . .
Oh really?
I am just waiting for your reply. I hung out at the beach all day. Honestly, I saw you alone so I
couldnt resist. Sorry.
I looked around.
I dont want anyone to see us, I said.
Theres a shack on the other side, nobody will find us. Can we talk? he said.
No, Debu.
Please, he said.
I checked the time on my phone.
Ten minutes, I said.
We went to Kings Shack on Miramar beach. We sat on sea-facing cane chairs. The evening
sea breeze cooled our skin. He ordered a beer. I had a glass of water.
How was your day? he said.
I showed him the mehndi on my hands.
Thats pretty.
Thanks. What did you do?
He lifted the left sleeve of his T-shirt. He had a two-inch tattoo on his upper arm. It said
Radhika.
What the hell, Debu? I said.
I had nothing to do all day. I decided to get one. I should have done it a long time ago.
You are getting tattoos with my name while I get married to another man? Have you gone
mad?
I love you, Radhika. Call it madness if you want.
It is not just what Debu says. Its how he says it. It can make even the most hardened bitch of a
heart melt. He placed one hand on his chest and looked at me with his drooping eyes. He brought
forward his hand to hold mine. I shook my head. He withdrew.
Please, baby, Debu said, one more chance.
I have to go back, I said. I signalled the waiter to give us the bill.
I have made the plan. You break the news to the family just one day before your wedding. I
will have my parents, aunts, uncles and cousins come down. My parents will do the talking with
yours. Dont worry. You just handle the boys side.
Me?
Yeah. Dont give them too much time to react. Just say you cant do this and they can leave.
You dont have to tell them about me until our wedding is over.
My heart started to beat at turbo speed.
Debu, I said.
It sounds crazy, baby, but this is the only way. Your relatives will murmur a bit, but at least
they wont say that the wedding was cancelled. As for the boys side, who cares? We will be in New
York in no time.
What?
You can get a transfer back to New York, right? Or if you want to remain in London, I can
come there. Will do whatever you say. I am sure you are in an important role now.
Debu, what are you talking about? All this. . .okay, now I need to go, I said.
I stood up and walked out of the restaurant. He followed me. He came up close behind me and
whispered, Have faith in me, baby.
My phone rang. Brijesh. I stepped aside to take the call.
Hey, I said.
I sent you a message.
Sorry, I didnt see.
Where are you now?
Im, I said and wondered what to say, around. Just around only.
Another sunset walk? Like yesterday?
Debu went back to pay the bill and smiled at me from a distance. I spoke to Brijesh. No, I
dont want to go for a walk.
Oh okay, Brijesh said, disappointed.
But I need a drink, I said.
Theres that open air lounge in the Marriott. . . he said as I interrupted him.
No, away from the Marriott. Somewhere else. I need to get away, I said.
Should I ask for a car?
I want some fresh air. Also, I dont want to go with a driver. Can you arrange a bike?
You mean one of those rental Activas?
Yeah. Can you ride one of those?
Well, yes. I did in college.
Good. See me outside the Marriott in fifteen minutes.
I hung up.
All good, baby? Debu said, coming out of the shack.
I am going out with Brijesh, I said.
Oh, he said, sounding disheartened.
I am not doing this to hurt you.
You can hurt me. I hurt you as well. But please think. This is about our future. You cant be
with a guy you dont love.
All this is messing me up, Debu. I need to breathe.
Sure, baby. Take your time.
Thanks. Now dont come near me. Stay put for five minutes while I walk away.
He nodded. He opened his arms wide, asking for a hug. I looked around. Nobody could see us.
I hugged him. He wouldnt release me.
It feels so nice to hold you, baby, he whispered.
Its enough, leave me now. Please, I said in a soft voice.
C
20
areful, I said. The Activa wobbled on the bumpy road as we came out of the Marriott
driveway.
I havent ridden one of these in five years, Brijesh said. I wondered if I should hold him from
behind. I could, considering I would be his wife in three days. However, I didnt want him to think I
was too easy either. I kept my hands on his shoulders instead.
We passed down a narrow road between rice fields. He went fast. The breeze made my hair
fly all over my face.
This is fun, I said.
Great idea, Radhika, Brijesh said. Dump the relatives. Do our own thing.
Where are we going? I said.
Anjuna. Thats where we hung out when we came on a college trip.
Thirty minutes later, we reached the rocky Anjuna beach and parked the bike. We walked for
five minutes and reached a shack called Curlies. We sat on adjacent easy chairs, both of us facing the
Arabian Sea. I removed my sneakers to rest my feet on the sandy floor of Curlies.
Beer? Brijesh said.
Sure, I said. He asked a waiter to bring us two Kingfishers. Two tables away, I saw another
Indian couple. The girl wore red and white bangles on both hands, a wedding chudaa; they had just
gotten married. Must be their honeymoon. They held hands, but it seemed a little awkward. Arranged
marriage, maybe. I looked at Brijesh. We would be a married couple too by this weekend. Brijesh
smiled as he handed me a half-pint Kingfisher bottle.
What did you tell your folks? Brijesh said.
I told Aditi didi that I am going for a walk with you.
They dont know you are at Anjuna?
No, I said, mom will freak out.
I sipped my beer.
We watched the sun go down. A young singer at Curlies sang and played the guitar. The Goan
sunset became even more poignant with the music. The singer sang Justin Biebers song, Sorry.
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say Im sorry now?
The song made me think of Debu. He had come all the way from New York. Sure, he had been
a jerk. But dont people make mistakes? Wouldnt most men react the same way if their girlfriend
earned triple their salary? All he wants now is to marry me. Doesnt he deserve a chance?
You seem lost, Brijesh said. Am I so boring?
I shook my head. I scolded myself for letting my mind go back to Debu again and again. And
why am I rationalizing his behaviour so much? Is it again my female manufacturing defect, saying
things like But isnt that what most men would do?
Focus on the man you are with right now, mini-me screamed at me.
No, you are not boring. Its a lovely place. Thanks, Brijesh, I said.
I still didnt like his name. Hated it, in fact. Why did it have to be so unfashionable? Meet my
husband, Debashish Sen versus Meet my husband, Brijesh Gulati. Eww.
Girl, stop daydreaming.
We came to Goa on a mechanical-engineering college field trip.
Engineering field trip to Goa? I said.
Well, we convinced the college authorities theres enough industry in Goa.
Like draught-beer-brewing machines? I said.
He laughed. I admit it was a bit of a fraud. But we did visit the Goa Shipyard and Vedantas
iron ore facility.
For ten minutes?
Fifteen minutes. Rest on the beaches. But hey, we submitted a report and everything.
I took another sip of beer.
This is what happens at NIT? Goa trips in the name of industry visits? I tut-tutted.
Some of our classmates did go to the Bhilai Steel Plant. They hate us till today.
We laughed together. Okay, I can do this, I told myself. He may not be the most interesting guy
around, but the engineering college stories did make him more human.
You seem to have had fun in college.
Im not as boring as you think.
I didnt say you are.
Actually, I am. Particularly when it comes to talking to women. But with the boys, I did have
fun.
Yeah? You like boys? I said and winked at him.
No. . .no I meant. . . he said and blushed.
I laughed. I am teasing you.
I know. Sorry. You got me.
You think women are different? I said.
He shrugged.
They are, right? Women are not like men, he said.
Well, in some ways not. But in many ways, yes.
Of course, we are all people. People are the same, he said.
I tried not to stare at him too much. I wondered if he ever thought about things like gender
equality.
Brijesh, do you know what is a feminist?
Sort of. But what exactly is it? he said and blinked his eyes. He genuinely didnt seem to
know.
You havent heard the word feminist?
Of course I have. I sort of know what it is. Equal rights for women, right? Is that the
definition?
Feminism is a movement that seeks to define, establish and achieve equal political,
economic, cultural, personal and social rights for women. A feminist is someone who believes in this
movement.
Wow, he said.
What wow?
The way you said the definition. Its cool.
Thanks. But are you one?
Never really thought about it. Never faced a situation where I had to be one. But I guess, yes.
You are? I said.
I think all human beings should have equal rights. Its not men versus women, its human
versus human. Feminist is a wrong term. It should be humanist. The right question is Are you a
humanist? Well, everyone should be, he said.
True, I said.
Are you a feminist, Radhika?
What do you mean? I am a woman.
Not all women are feminists.
Really?
Mothers who treat sons better than daughters. Are they feminists?
No, I said.
Women who judge other working women as not being good enough mothers. Are they
feminists?
No. I see your point. Yes, I consider myself a feminist, I said.
Can I say something?
Sure.
I dont think anyone has to specifically call himself or herself a feminist. If you are a fair
person and want equal opportunities for all, thats a start.
I looked at him and smiled.
The waiter brought us another round of beer. The sun had vanished, leaving behind a dark grey
sky. We watched the waves splash on the beachfront.
What else did you do in Goa on your field trip? I said.
Stuff. Stuff you dont want to know.
I got interested. Oh, really. Like what?
Nothing.
Try me.
Okay, checking out all the firang women on all the beaches.
You mean leching at them?
Of course not. I would call it more a studied observation, he said.
I laughed.
Engineers are sick, I said.
They are. Deprivation does that to us.
What else?
We smoked up.
What? Weed?
He nodded.
You had weed in Goa? I said.
Yeah. You can get it at Anjuna. There are some shops behind the shack. I dont know if they
still operate. But we scored from there.
Mr Brijesh Gulati, you do have a past.
He laughed. Most of it is around studying to top the class and get a scholarship to the USA.
But yes, we did some fun stuff.
Should we try some?
You want to smoke weed? Now? he said, startled.
Yeah. Or is it too much for a good Indian bride to smoke a joint a couple of days before the
wedding?
No, no, nothing like that.
Too feminist?
No, Radhika. Nothing like that. How can we smoke up? We have all our relatives here.
Not at Anjuna. See if you can get some.
He looked at me. I gave him a wicked grin. He stood up.
Give me fifteen minutes, he said.
Come behind the rocks. Nobody will see us, Brijesh said as I took a drag.
We had left Curlies and come up to a remote corner on Anjuna beach. Brijesh rolled three
joints. We started with our first one.
You have done this before? he said.
No, but I always wanted to try, I said.
Go slow, he said.
With each drag my mind became more calm, my senses more numb. The stress of Debu
hovering around the Marriott went up in smoke. Brijesh also didnt feel as unfamiliar.
Wow, this reminds me of my college days, he said.
Bet your parents never thought this is the kind of bahu they are getting, I said.
He shrugged.
What kind of bahu?
This kind. Smoking up on the beach before her wedding. Its not what good Indian bahus do.
If their son can do this, why cant the bahu? he said.
Now that is feminism, I said and high-fived him.
Everything doesnt need hi-fi labels like feminism. Just logic. If I can do it, you can do it.
You are sweet.
Isnt sweet the word women use when they arent attracted to a guy but dont want to hurt him
either?
Smart you are, Mr Facebook. Not too duh about girls.
Well, in this aspect I am good. Been Mr Sweet all my life.
Sweet is good, I said and took the last puff of the joint.
He smiled.
Shall we head back? It will get late, he said.
Yeah. Save those two joints for the Marriott. We will need them.
We rode back on the Activa. This time I held him around the waist. Maybe it was the beer and
the joint, but it didnt feel odd. We passed through the same rice fields, now invisible in the darkness.
The headlight of the Activa showed us the road. We stopped at a crossroads to confirm the way.
We take a right from here, yes? I said, placing my chin on his shoulder.
Yeah, he said.
As we turned, we passed two cops at a checkpoint. They stopped us.
Licence, one of the cops said.
Brijesh stood up from the Activa and sifted through his pockets. He took out his wallet and
checked inside. He couldnt find it.
Oh, I think I kept it in the hotel safe, he said.
What? the cop said.
I have a California licence. From the USA. I left it at the hotel, sorry.
The cops looked at each other.
We have to fine you, one cop said. He took out a challan booklet.
The other cop turned to me.
Madam, this is not right. You should not drive without a licence.
We are tourists. Sorry.
We had to pay a fine of 400 rupees. Brijesh took out a 1,000-rupee note from his wallet. The
cops gave him the change. As Brijesh put the wallet back in his pocket, a small paper bundle fell out.
You dropped something, the cop said and picked it up. He held it in his hand and brought it
closer to his face. He sniffed at it once, and gave it to his colleague.
Damn.
Can both of you step aside, please? Give us the Activa keys.
Whats the matter? I said.
He lifted up the paper packet.
This is marijuana. It is illegal. We need to take you to the police station.
A
21
njuna police station, mom. Opposite Childrens Park. The driver will know. Please come
quietly with dad. Dont tell any of the relatives.
What are you doing in the police station? my mother said, her voice hysterical.
Stop shouting, mom. I am here with Brijesh.
Brijesh? Brijesh and you are at the police station? Why?
If you come here I can tell you. Bring dad, okay?
What about Brijeshs parents? mom said.
He has called them separately. They are coming too.
Oh God. What is going on? Are you safe?
Yes. Mom, Brijesh didnt have a licence.
Licence? Why?
We went for a ride on an Activa.
Activa? There are so many cars we have hired.
Mom, just come.
I hung up the phone. Brijesh sat next to me. Sub-inspector Samuel DSouza sat in front of us.
Where did you buy it?
Its common in the lanes of Anjuna beach. I am sure you know, Brijesh said.
Are you suggesting we know and do nothing about it?
No sir, I said. Sorry.
I elbowed Brijesh to be quiet.
When is the wedding? the sub-inspector said.
Friday, I said.
In two days. And this is how you start your married life. Doing drugs?
Its not a drug, sir. Its mild herbal stuff. In fact, in California it is legal, Brijesh said.
The sub-inspector gave us a stern look.
Is this California? he said.
No, sir, Brijesh said, head down.
What is this place?
Goa, sir.
What do people come here to do? the sub-inspector said.
To party, sir? Brijesh said, in a soft voice.
No, the sub-inspector shouted. People come here to have a good, clean, peaceful holiday.
Not to do this nonsense.
Yes, sir, Brijesh said, his tone apologetic.
I pressed my teeth tight to prevent a smile. A snigger slipped out. The inspector turned to me.
Are you finding this funny? Sub-inspector DSouza said.
No, sir, I said, keeping a straight face.
Brijeshs and my parents entered the police station. They saw us, sitting across from the subinspector.
What happened, inspector? my father said.
Are you the parents? Come see what your children are up to, Sub-inspector DSouza said.
You are too much, Radhika, my mother said. I sat in a car with my parents. Brijesh sat in a separate
car with his own folks. The naughty kids had to be separated, I guess, as we made our way back to the
hotel.
I am sorry, mom, I said for the seventh time, and thank you, dad.
My father had finally made the cops thaw. Dad figured out a contact in State Bank of India in
Goa, who in turn knew the police commissioner of the state. A few calls, tons of apologies and a
wedding invitation to the entire police station was what it took to finally make the sub-inspector melt.
Both of you are going to start a life together. Have kids together. Is this how mature adults are
expected to behave? the sub-inspector said before we left. My father kept quiet as he sat in the front
seat of the car. My mother continued to talk. I have never heard of any girl drinking and smoking
drugs before her wedding. Never.
I kept quiet. She continued, If our relatives find out, what will they think? Out-of-control girl.
I wanted to react. However, I clenched my fists tight to restrain myself. She didnt stop.
What will the Gulatis think? she said. They must be questioning their decision tonight.
Okay, mom, that is enough, I said.
What enough? Drinking beer. Having charas-ganja. Is this even a girl?
Their son did the same.
So?
What do you mean, so? Why arent you saying they must be ashamed of their son too?
He is a boy. He will do his mischief. Why do you have to do the same? Is this your so-called
equality?
Mom. Its done. Can we please be quiet until we get to the hotel?
She faced me with folded hands.
I can be quiet. But you also have to behave. I beg you. Can you please control yourself until
your wedding?
And what after that? I said. I am no longer your headache?
She glared at me. I looked away.
Will you behave? she said finally.
Okay fine, I said.
Good.
We reached the hotel. All of us got out of the car.
Sorry, dad, I said to him.
I trust you to make the right choices, beta. Dont embarrass us.
I sat on the bed, well past midnight. Aditi didi lay down next to me.
Weed? Grass? You did grass with Brijesh?
One shared joint. Still we got into so much trouble.
How did you even get the stuff?
Brijesh scored it from the lanes in Anjuna.
She turned to me, surprised.
I thought both of you are the studious types.
We are not that dull, didi, I said.
Proud of you, little sister, Aditi didi said.
I heard two knocks on the door. Didi and I looked at each other.
Wait, Aditi didi whispered as she stepped off the bed. She went to the door and looked
through the keyhole.
Who is it? she said out loud.
Oh, sorry. Excuse me, wrong room, I heard a faint voice.
Didi came back to bed.
Who? I said.
I dont know. Some man in a suit. Anyway, tell me more about the police station drama. Its
too funny.
One-two-three-four. Come on, start, Mickey, the choreographer, shouted as he switched on the
music. The song London thumakda filled the room. Five of my aunts, including Richa mami and
Kamla bua, were practising on stage with the choreographer.
Follow my moves, he said.
Mickey had a lean body. In black tights and a black T-shirt he looked like an insect compared
to my well-fed, substantial Punjabi aunts. The aunts moved. The makeshift stage groaned under the
pressure.
Dont bang your feet so hard. Grace, grace, Mickey called out. Placing his right hand on his
head he twirled.
I practised in another corner of the function room, along with my cousins. Mickeys assistant
Vikram was to teach us our moves.
Faster, faster, match the beat of the song, Mickey said and clapped on the stage. The aunts
moved their bottoms left and right twice, before circling around. Kamla bua made a face. She hated
so much action this early in the morning.
Ladies, Vikram said to my group, I will show you once and then you follow.
Vikram played DJ wale babu. The rap song required us to be jerky to match the erratic beat.
Bam! I heard a loud noise from the stage. Hotel staff rushed to the scene. My aunts and the
choreographer huddled around Richa mami, who had fallen down. A hundred and ten kilos of Punjabi
mass lay on the floor, wrapped in an oversized white salwar-kameez.
Who hired this idiot choreographer? Such difficult steps for us, she shrieked, holding her
ankle.
Sorry, madam, sorry, Mickey said.
What sorry? Kamla bua said. You should see who can do what step.
Yes, madam.
The hotel staff brought a first-aid kit and sprayed a pain reliever on her leg. Two waiters
helped Richa mami stand up.
Can we take a break? Kamla bua said.
But madam, the sangeet is tonight, Mickey said.
We havent even had breakfast. Wont we get weakness if we do dance without breakfast?
Richa mami said.
She was right. Punjabis need calories, by the hour, every hour.
My cousins and I took a table by the window at our familys dedicated breakfast buffet area. Some of
them were rehearsing their steps even now. I went to the breakfast counter and picked up a plate.
Can I have whole-wheat toast, please? I said to a waiter.
Would you like that with peanut butter and honey? said a voice behind me.
I turned around. My eyes almost popped out of my face.
Neel? I said out loud.
Hi, he said. He looked the same, handsome as hell. He had gelled hair, salt-and-pepper
stubble and a lithe frame. He wore a black suit and a white shirt, both crisp.
Neel? I whispered his name again, more aware of my surroundings. What are you doing
here?
I told you. I have to talk to you face-to-face. I came to your room last night. Another lady
answered. So I left.
My sister, I informed him faintly, looking around rapidly. Keep your voice low. How did
you even get here so fast? Werent you in some copper mine in Sri Lanka?
I just. . . he said and paused. I took a chartered flight. Doesnt matter. Can we talk?
You chartered a plane to come here? I said. Neel did not meet my eyes.
The waiter brought me whole-wheat toast.
I have to go, I said.
I know, he said.
You cant come here. This is our private family dining area.
I know.
Neel, look at me.
He looked at me finally then, and I remembered those eyes. Those eyes and a lot more.
Hong Kong
Two Years Ago
T
22
his is your desk, said Bianca, a secretary in the Distressed Debt Group. Look outside, you
even have a Hong Kong harbour view.
It took me a while to adjust to my new surroundings. Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong is located
at the Cheung Kong Centre skyscraper in Central, occupying the sixtieth to the sixty-eighth floors. The
distressed debt team is located on the sixty-seventh floor. From the floor to the ceiling windows of
the glass-and-steel building, one can see the Hong Kong skyline and harbour towards the north. In the
southern direction, one has views of the Peak, the top of the green hill on Hong Kong Island.
Hong Kong is an ex-British colony, now under Chinese control. The British exited in 1997, but
left behind one of the most modern, developed and efficient cities in the world. Consisting of the
Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon peninsula and New Territories, this city of seven million inhabitants
is one of the busiest global financial centres. Compact, brightly lit and buzzing, Hong Kong
overwhelms you upon arrival with its insomnia and beehive activity.
A company broker will call you. To help with the house-hunting, Bianca continued. And
here are some other helpful contacts.
She gave me a file of all the people who would help me in my relocation.
Neel will meet you in his office at 9, Bianca said and left.
I logged into my computer, arranged the stationery on my desk. I put up a few family pictures
on my cubicle walls. At 9, I walked up to Neels corner office.
Ah, Radhika. Come right on in, Neel said.
He wore a white shirt, silver cufflinks and a blue Hermes skinny tie. I had not seen him since
associate training two years ago. His office had panoramic vistas of Hong Kong. The sunshine
pouring into the room made his skin glow.
He gave me a firm handshake.
Thank you for having me in your group, I said.
Its our pleasure. We dont normally get high performers from New York here. How are you
settling in?
I am good. Just arrived over the weekend.
Where are you staying?
Shangri-La.
Nice. Hey, did you have any breakfast? Want to step over to the breakout area for a coffee?
Sure, I said.
We took the elevator down to the sixty-first floor. The Goldman breakout area is a café of
sorts, where the staff often take a break for meals.
Neel and I went up to the counter person. Neel turned to me. What would you like?
Whole-wheat toast. With peanut butter and honey, I said.
Toast? And what? the counter person said.
Peanut butter and honey, I said.
Huh? she said.
Faa sang zoeng mat mgoi, Neel said. The woman smiled and nodded.
Thanks, I said.
No issues. I dont really speak Cantonese. But learning a few words is never a bad idea,
Neel said. He ordered a black coffee and bagel for himself.
We took our food and sat at a window-facing table. He briefed me about the group.
We are ten professionals here. It isnt as large as New York. However, we are growing faster
than any other Goldman office.
I nodded and listened with full attention.
You will work with Josh Ang and Peter Wu. They look after China and Korea respectively.
There may be special deals from time to time you might get pulled into.
Looking forward to it, I said.
Good. We have a morning team meeting every day at 8. That is when everyone talks about
their deals.
Okay.
I want you to speak up. I encourage people to raise questions so we challenge each other,
Neel said.
Of course.
Feel free to come into my office. Josh is your immediate boss, but we dont really believe in
formal roles here. Theres some peanut butter on your lip.
Oh, really? I said and wiped my lip with a tissue. I am sorry.
The other side.
I shifted the tissue and felt my face turn red. Neel smiled. He looked even more gorgeous when
he smiled.
Welcome to Hong Kong, he said.
We have a Bank of East Asia distressed debt auction coming up. There are fifty loans, sold as a
portfolio. Bids due in two weeks, Josh said at the morning meeting.
Two weeks? Thats tight, Peter said.
All banks accumulate bad loans over time. Sometimes the bank feels it is easier to sell off
those loans at a discount rather than chase the borrowers. To speed up things, they sell those loans as
a portfolio, or in a bunch. In a sense, it clears their entire dirty plate in one shot. However, for
bidders like us it means a crazy amount of work, evaluating what is on the plate.
We can pass. People are busy with other deals, right? Neel said.
Actually, I could look at it, I said. All eyes turned to me.
I can. I dont have too much going on, I said.
It is fifty companies. Youll have to go through them all. You sure? Josh said, in his mixed
American and Chinese accent.
We have two weeks. I can work weekends too, I said.
I could spare two days too, Peter said.
So can I, said Simon, another Taiwanese analyst in the group.
Neel tapped his fingers on the conference room table.
Lets do it, he said finally, and stood up to signal the end of the meeting.
For the next two weeks, I camped in my cubicle. Boxes of documents to be reviewed for the
bid surrounded me. I only went back to the hotel to sleep, shower and change. One Friday night I
didnt even do that. I worked straight through the night and watched the Saturday morning sunrise from
the office window.
Radhika, what are you doing here? Neels voice startled me.
I turned around. In workout clothes, he looked different from his usual formal self. He was
wearing a black Under Armor T-shirt, a brand that reminded me of Debu. The portfolio work had kept
him off my thoughts over the last few days. But now I felt pain flood my heart. When will I get over
that man? I wondered.
Good morning, Neel, I said. Just wrapping up the bid. Will have it ready Monday morning.
You have dark circles under your eyes. Did you even go back last night?
I smiled and shook my head.
This is too much, Radhika. You have to maintain a balance.
He placed his hand on the edge of my cubicle door. I could see his bicep flex through his
sleeve.
Going to the gym? I said.
Im going on a mountain hike. I prefer working out outdoors.
That sounds like fun.
Yes. More than half of Hong Kong is country parks. Beautiful hikes.
I have heard.
Hope you see a bit of this city and not just this office.
I will. Just want this portfolio out of the way, I said and then covered my mouth as I yawned.
Radhika, you need to go home.
I will. Soon. What brings you to the office?
Left my mobile phone behind yesterday. Just picking it up for the hike.
He went into his office and came out after a few minutes. He saw me staring at my
spreadsheet.
Still here? Go rest.
I smiled.
Twenty more minutes. Tops, I said.
Im leaving. Good work, Radhika.
Thanks. Bye, Neel, have a nice hike, I said, eyes on my monitor.
He walked away from me and paused. He turned around and came back.
Radhika, theres something I want to tell you.
Okay, I said and shifted my gaze to him.
Theres a confidential deal. Some distressed companies dont like the world to know they are
in distress. It can affect their business.
Sure, I understand, I said.
This one is in the Philippines. Only the Goldman Sachs Asia head and I know about it. I cant
even discuss it in the morning meeting.
Oh, okay, I said.
I need an associate on the deal. Would you like to be on it?
The prospect of more work in my current exhausted state made me feel even more tired.
However, to be in a confidential deal and work with a partner meant a lot.
Sure, I said. Whats the timing?
You finish the bid. Then I will brief you. Well also need to meet the company people.
Sure. What sector is it?
Ill tell you. Real soon. Bye now. And get out of here fast, he said.
What the hell, I said to myself. Debu had unfriended me on Facebook. For the first time in Hong Kong
I had finished work early and come back to my hotel at 5 p.m. The team had liked my final
presentation on the portfolio. We had submitted a bid for fourteen cents on the dollar for the loans.
Exhausted, I had been looking forward to a calm evening in the hotel and a good long sleep.
However, I made the mistake of opening my laptop and logging on to Facebook. Like an idiot, I
searched for Debashish Sens profile. I couldnt find him on my friends list.
Damn. I typed his name for the third time. Yes, he had unfriended me. I could understand why.
Actually, I could not understand why. I wasnt some stalking witch who would cast an evil eye on his
posts and pictures. Sure, we had broken up. People break up. They dont have to vanish like this.
I didnt have his phone number anymore. I had deleted all his previous emails. I felt like
calling Avinash to ask for Debus contacts again. I stopped myself and turned on the TV instead. Most
of the channels were in Chinese. One channel showed a soap opera. I couldnt understand one word.
However, I saw a girl on the screen cry, probably for her lost love. I dont know what it triggered in
me, but I joined her. I clutched my pillow tight and cried. I had resisted this so perfectly for weeks.
Ever since I came to Hong Kong I had buried myself in work. I thought I had made great progress with
my break-up. Now I was back to square one.
Why did he unfriend me? I cried even more. I switched off the hotel room lights, opened the
minibar and found little whisky and vodka bottles. I drank four of them, bottoms up, and lay down in
bed. My head hurt as it sifted through images of Debu. Will I ever get over him?
I closed my eyes. I slept, or passed out, as weeks of sleep deprivation caught up with me.
I woke up as my phone rang. I had a bad headache. I opened one eye and saw the caller. It was
Neel.
Damn. Damn. Damn. I switched on the light, ran into the bathroom and splashed water on my
face. Only then did I pick up the call.
Hello? I said, my voice unclear.
Sorry, were you sleeping? Is it too late? Neel said.
I checked the time. It was only 8.30 p.m.
No, no. Just took a nap. I am sorry. I left office early today.
You deserve the rest. Sorry to wake you up.
Its fine. I needed to anyway.
Focus, Radhika. Its a partner on the line.
I just called to ask if you could come to the office tomorrow at 7.30 a.m.? Neel said.
Huh? Yes, sure.
I can brief you on the Philippines deal. Better we talk about it before everyone arrives.
Of course, I said.
El Casa Seaplane and Resorts, I read the tasteful aquamarine-coloured cover of a brochure Neel
handed to me.
He took a sip of his black coffee and put the cup aside. He played with one of his blue
sapphire cufflinks as he spoke to me. You know much about the Philippines?
One of the Southeast Asian countries, right?
Yeah. Seven thousand-plus islands. Couple of main ones though. Manila is the capital.
Okay, I said. I took notes in my notebook.
The company is El Casa Seaplane and Resorts. They borrowed too much. Business
nosedived due to a cyclone. Trouble. Hence at our desk.
I scribbled down whatever I could. Neel continued to speak.
Palawan is in the south of the Philippines. Often voted as one of the most beautiful islands in
the world.
Sure, I said, jotting down at a frantic pace.
Around Palawan there are tiny, super-exclusive, privately owned islands. El Casa operates
ten resorts, each on one of these private mini-islands.
I flipped through the brochure. It had stunning aerial pictures of the boutique tropical island
resorts. The brochure said that none of El Casas resorts had more than ten rooms.
It says rooms are 1,000 dollars a night, I said, surprised.
Neel smiled.
Yes, so it is mostly super-rich foreign tourists. Locals cant afford it.
How does one even get there? I said.
You fly from Manila to Palawan, and then take one of the company seaplanes to the resorts.
Expensive operation, I said.
Yes. So when business takes a nosedive it gets really tough, Neel said.
Neel told me that Typhoon Haiyan, one of the deadliest tropical cyclones, had hit the
Philippines last year. It had left thousands dead. The country had still not recovered from it. High-end
tourists still avoided the Philippines, making El Casa suffer. I took notes as Neel continued to talk.
Owner is Marcos Sereno. Fifty years old, first generation, liquor baron. Tough businessman,
respected in the community. El Casa is a passion project for him. So he is touchy about the world
finding out it failed.
You have the financials? I said.
Neel slid a five-inch-thick set of documents towards me.
This contains everything. The existing lending banks want to get out. Marcos wants to
cooperate, as long as his reputation stays intact.
Understood, I said. I will go through all this.
Good. And lets go to Palawan next week and meet Marcos.
O

range juice or champagne? a Cathay Pacific flight attendant said. She offered Neel drinks on a
tray.
Orange juice, please. Too early for champagne, Neel said.
I took the same. We sat next to each other in the business-class cabin of the morning flight to
Manila. I was on my first real business trip, travelling to a different country. I looked out of the
window as the plane took off, making Hong Kongs skyscrapers look like Lego toys down below.
So what did you think of El Casa? Neel said.
Oh, wait, I said and opened my laptop bag. I took out the printout of my financial model.
Keep this aside for now. Tell me your gut feeling on the business, Neel said.
My gut feeling? I said, surprised. I was just an associate. Why would a partner care about my
gut feeling? Wasnt it my job to just make the financial model and rattle out the numbers?
Yeah, Id like to know. Do you even like the business?
I took a few seconds to collect my thoughts before I spoke again. In some ways El Casa is a
rare asset, so quite valuable. In other ways it is a pain, as there are limited buyers for this thing. Also,
I cant imagine Philippines law being the most investor-friendly, I said.
Good. I like how you think, in several directions at the same time, Neel said.
Thanks, I said, embarrassed by his praise. I fumbled through my sheets.
So what do we do here? Neel said.
We get a buyer, I said.
Meaning?
We talk to big hotel chains. This business needs a high-end global brand. Otherwise people
are not going to come, I said.
Hmmm. . . Neel said.
I am thinking Aman Resorts, Four Seasons. Something in that category, I said.
Neel looked at me. I saw pride in his eyes.
You are smart, he said.
Not really, I said, like a stupid fool.
What do you mean?
Nothing. Thank you, I meant. Would you like me to show you the financial model?
Sure, he said.
Over the next hour I went over the numbers. The company had fifty million dollars worth of
loans. It could probably repay only half. Neel listened with full attention, cross-questioning me
several times.
Thats good. I think we have a sense of what is going on here, he said when I finished.
The flight attendant served us breakfast: fruit, cereal, milk and omelettes.
I could also build another scenario. . . I said as Neel interrupted me.
Enough. Do you only think about work?
No, I just. . .
Let us enjoy our meal. No more talking shop.
Sure. I ate a strawberry with my fork.
How do you find Hong Kong? Neel said.
Efficient. Everything is close by.
You found an apartment?
Yes. On Old Peak Road. I am moving in next week.
It is a good area, Neel said.
Old Peak Road passed through the Midlevels, an area midway to the Peak. A one-and-a-half
bedroom apartment in this expat area cost me 6,000 US dollars a month in rent.
Where do you stay? I said.
Repulse Bay. On the South side. You should visit. I do team dinners at my place sometimes.
Sure, I said.
He applied jam on his toast. I noticed his slender fingers. I continued to gaze at them until he
spoke again, startling me.
Kusum would love to meet you, he said.
Kusum? I said.
My wife. We have two kids. Siya and Aryan. Seven and three.
Of course, a man so amazing had to be married.
Oh, how nice, I said.
Yeah. How about you?
Well, I am not married, I said and smiled.
Of course. But wheres your family?
Delhi. Mom and dad. I have an elder sister.
Great. You close to your parents?
I paused for a few seconds to think before I answered.
In some ways I am close. Dad is really quiet. I am close to my mom. But we fight a lot, I
said.
Neel laughed.
Really? Over what? he said.
The stupidest things. Mostly it is about her obsession to get me married.
Oh, you are young. Why marry so soon?
Exactly. If only she would get that.
Typical Indian parents, right? Neel said.
I nodded.
When did you leave India? I said.
When I was twelve. I grew up in London after that. Undergrad at Oxford. Harvard for my
MBA later. Met Kusum there, actually.
Oh, college sweethearts, I said. I realized I should have shown more restraint. I was
speaking to a partner, my bosss boss.
You could say that, he said and laughed.
The captains announcement about the flight landing interrupted our conversation. When the
plane hovered above Manila, Neel spoke again.
Why did you leave New York? Neel said.
Personal reasons, I repeated my rehearsed answer.
Oh, I am sorry. I didnt mean to. . . Neel said as I interrupted him.
I had a break-up. A bad break-up.
Neel looked at me. He raised his long eyebrows.
Really? he said.
Yeah, why? I said.
You moved all this way for a guy?
Worse. Not for a guy. But for a guy who didnt want me.
Again I felt I had crossed the line of acceptable conversation with a partner. Neel fumbled
with his seatbelt as he searched for a suitable response.
Well, anyway. Welcome to the Philippines, he said.
The flight landed with a gentle thud.
I spent years to build El Casa. No logic why I did it. Just wanted to show the world how beautiful
my country is, Marcos said.
We sat in the El Casa office in Palawan across from the owner and CEO, Marcos Sereno, who
had a portly frame and wore a Hawaiian shirt.
We had taken another short flight from Manila to Palawan and come for the meeting straight
from Palawan airport. On the way, I saw a sleepy city full of palm trees and long, powdery beaches.
Your country is stunning. It was evident even in the short journey from the airport to here,
Neel said to Marcos.
You have to see the resorts. This is nothing, Marcos said dismissively.
Yeah? Neel said.
You are staying at one tonight, right? Marcos said.
We had actually booked a hotel in Manila on our way back. Our Hong Kong flight is
tomorrow, Neel said.
Marcos waved a no with his hands.
Forget Manila. Crowded and polluted. You stay at my resort.
But. . . Neel said before Marcos interrupted him.
I insist. My seaplane will take you there.
Sure, Neel said. Apart from being gracious to our client, we wanted to see the quality of the
resorts anyway. Marcos told his secretary to arrange two rooms at the El Casa Pengalusian Island.
Now let us talk business, Marcos said after he delegated our travel arrangements.
My colleague Radhika here has prepared some numbers, Neel said.
I passed out copies of the financial model.
I have tried to value each resort, I said. Over the next ten minutes I walked him through my
assumptions and projections. After I finished, Marcos took a deep breath.
What now? Marcos said.
I looked at Neel. It was time for him to speak.
We need a new buyer. However, nobody will buy a company with a fifty-million-dollar loan
on it. We have to settle the banks at a discount first.
They will settle, Marcos said.
But we want them to settle at a low price. We have to paint a terrible scenario for the banks.
Say the business is worth almost nothing. You will have to play along, I said.
Really? Marcos said.
Yes. So they will sell the loans to us cheap. We will then find a new buyer. From our profit,
we can give you 20 per cent, I said.
Marcoss eyes widened. He looked at Neel.
Shes good, Marcos said.
Only my best people for you. Any other issues, Marcos? Neel said. Marcos turned to me
again.
Will the new buyer fire people? Marcos said.
Depends on the new owner, I said.
I dont want that. No firing people. They are my people, Marcos said.
I looked at Neel. We had a deadlock. The value of the company would drop if the new buyer
had a no-layoffs clause.
No firing anyone for five years. Okay? Neel said.
Marcos looked at me. I pursed my lips.
Fine. We can build that in. But if we do, do we have a deal? I said.
This girl is a quick one, Marcos said to Neel and grinned.
In my group, we like to close deals, Neel said.
Marcos extended his hand.
Lets do it, Marcos said.
We shook hands. We had an in-principle agreement.
Ill send in the term sheet tomorrow, I said.
Is she always so obsessed with work? Marcos said. No urgency. Send it in a few days. This
is the Philippines. Theres more to life than work here.
Theres nothing else but work in my life, I thought. I smiled at Marcos.
Try my beer. Number one in the Philippines, Marcos said as he opened the fridge behind his
desk.
Okay, this is a little scary, I said as I tied the flimsy seatbelt around me. Neel and I sat next to each
other in the compact four-seater El Casa seaplane. The seats were tiny, our heads inches from the
roof. The pilot gave us a thumbs-up sign, indicating take-off.
What plane is this? Neel asked the pilot.
Amphibious Cessna 208 Caravan, sir, the pilot said. The plane could take off and land on
water as well as land. We took off from the local airport at Palawan. The turboprop noise made it
difficult to talk. Neel saw my petrified face.
You okay? he screamed so I could hear him.
I nodded and blinked my eyelids. He grinned.
Breathe, he said.
I exhaled and inhaled a few times. The plane took off. I looked outside the window. The
crystal-blue sea, white beaches and the green cover of trees below me made me forget our precarious
position.
Wow, I blurted out as I saw some of the most breathtaking scenery I had ever seen in my life.
It really is spectacular, Neel said.
Fifteen minutes later, the plane hovered over the Pengalusian Island. Less than half a kilometre
long and only two hundred metres wide, the rice-grain-shaped island seemed tiny from above. The
beach ran all around the perimeter of the island. On the southern tip, a few huts became visible.
Thats the resort, the pilot said. The rest of the island is just left untouched. All natural.
I closed my eyes as the plane landed on its water skis. When I opened them, Neel and the pilot
were looking at me. Both of them had a grin on their faces.
I am sorry. Its beautiful, but scary, I said.
We stepped out of the plane into the sand. Two porters took our bags. The resort manager
greeted us.
You must be Mr Marcos Serenos special guests, he said. Welcome to El Casa Pengalusian.
I am Carlos, the resort manager.
He showed us our respective rooms. Each room was a little cottage on stilts, built above a
clear blue water lagoon.
If you sit on the balcony, Carlos said, you can see fish in the water below you.
I put my belongings in the luxurious room, which had wooden floors and a thatched roof. I felt
tired. I went up to the reception area where I found Neel in conversation with Carlos.
Pretty stunning place you have here, Neel said.
Thank you, sir, Carlos said.
I joined the two of them.
Carlos, can I talk to you later? I said. A few business-related questions about the resort?
Sure. Mr Sereno informed me, Carlos said.
Neel smiled at my attempt to do due diligence at every opportunity. Carlos excused himself
and left us in the lobby area. The sun shone bright, though there was only one hour to sunset.
Beats working on a bank portfolio, doesnt it? Neel said.
Totally, I said and laughed. This is the best deal ever. How beautiful is this place?
Yeah, glad we came. I had no idea this is so amazing.
We will find a buyer, right? I said.
Gosh. You are unbelievable. Just look at the view. Worry about the buyer later, Neel said.
Sorry, I said.
We walked out of the lobby to face the sea in front of us. Rock formations in the middle of the
ocean made the view even more dramatic.
Whats your plan for the rest of the evening? Neel said.
I have to make the term sheet, I said.
Come on. Do it back in the office. Want to take a walk around the island before dinner?
Sure, I said.
Lets change into workout clothes. See you here in thirty minutes, he said.
Neel and I walked on the two-kilometre trail that circled the island. Every nook and corner had
spectacular scenery. Warm seawater touched our shoes as we walked on the sand near the water. If
God hired an architect to design heaven, this was how it would be done.
Lets keep it brisk, Neel said and increased his stride. He now walked in front of me,
looking even better in his workout clothes: knee-length black shorts and a neon-green Nike T-shirt.
I wore a white T-shirt and grey trackpants.
You are really into fitness, I said.
I try, Neel said.
The hike that day. Walk today.
Well, when you get to my age, your metabolism drops. Not easy to remain fit.
You look so fit, I said. I wondered if I should have said it. I had just noticed a partners
physical appearance. Well, who in the office hadnt?
Thank you. I am old now. Forty-five.
Thats not so old, I said. Okay, why did I have to say that?
He laughed. Really? How old are you? Sorry. I shouldnt be asking a lady that.
I am twenty-five. Well, twenty-six soon.
Thats incredibly young. Look at you, already on big deals.
I am lucky.
Dont say that. You are good. You work hard. Thats when luck creeps up on you.
I turned to him and smiled.
Thanks, I said.
But you are twenty years younger. I feel even older now, Neel said.
You are a partner at Goldman Sachs at forty-five. Its pretty young. Plus, you look good.
Now why the fuck did I have to say that? You look good? You are with the head of
distressed debt for Asia. Radhika, control your tongue.
Thank you. Dont get to hear that so much these days, he said.
We circled the entire island and returned to the resort.
Dinner in an hour? I will take a shower and see you at the restaurant, he said.
Sure, I said.
I might run a few more rounds of the island before that, he said.
I feel like a slob, I said.
Relax. You must be tired. See you soon.
C

hampagne, sir, courtesy of Mr Marcos Sereno, Carlos said as he put a bottle of Dom Perignon
in a chiller next to us. We sat in the open-air restaurant in the resort, located in an alcove. The sun had
set. The clear sea reflected the palette of the sky. The restaurant had only six tables, each with several
lit candles on it.
Ours was the only occupied table.
Would you like some? Neel said as he lifted the bottle.
Yes, please, I said.
Like a gentleman, Neel stood up and poured the champagne for me.
Thank you, I said.
You are welcome, Neel said. We raised our glasses in a toast.
To many more deals, he said.
Especially ones involving private island assets, I said. Both of us laughed.
Waiters brought us various kinds of seafood, all caught fresh from the sea. Everything tasted
delicious.
One of the waiters brought us a heart-shaped red velvet cake.
For the lovely couple, he said in a Filipino accent.
The waiters words left me stumped. I struggled to speak.
Oh, actually, we. . . I said. Neel intervened.
Thank you for the cake. Didnt have to be heart-shaped, as we are not a couple.
The waiter looked at both of us, surprised.
We are here on a business trip, I said. The waiter became even more confused. Who comes
to Pengalusian Island on work?
Neel smiled.
Thanks for the cake, he repeated. The waiter left us. We burst out laughing. Neel poured us
both another glass of champagne.
Okay, that was a little weird, I said.
Totally. Did not expect that.
I could feel my head swim after two drinks.
Though I must say I was flattered, Neel said.
Really? Why? I said, pretending to be ignorant even as I fished for more compliments.
Well, even at my age he thought I could be with you. Thats a compliment.
Well. True that, I said. All that running is surely helping.
We clinked our glasses. I dont know if it was the champagne, the beautiful setting or that Neel
made me feel comfortable, but I found it easy to talk to him.
You should come here with your wife, I said.
Huh? he said, slightly surprised. Yeah, Kusum would love this place. Who wouldnt?
So you guys met in college? Love at first sight? I said. I dont know if I had overstepped the
line. After three glasses of champagne, all so-called lines seem pretty blurred anyway.
Yeah, you could say that, yeah, Neel said, after deliberating for a second.
Sorry, didnt mean to pry.
No, its fine. Kusum and I were in the same class. She was born and brought up in the USA. I
mostly lived in the UK. Both of us were desis, yet Westernized. I guess we connected.
How wonderful, I said.
Yeah. Absolutely, he said. He became quiet. He took a big sip from his glass and spoke
again. How about you? In love pretty hard? Moving countries.
Never again. This love business is not for me, I said. I took a knife and cut across the heartshaped
cake.
Thats symbolic, he said. A knife through your bleeding red velvet heart.
I laughed.
Pretty much what happened. Discarded like used tissue. Switched like a TV channel, I said.
Ouch, I am sorry, Neel said. Though, excuse me, I am a bit surprised.
Surprised?
Like who were you dating? Brad Pitt?
I laughed. Not really. Just a regular guy. Job on Madison Avenue. Why?
How on earth could any guy leave you? Neel said.
His words felt like cold menthol balm on my bruised, wounded heart. I could have cried, but
girls who cry in front of their bosses are losers, and those who do in front of the bosss boss are the
biggest losers.
I am not. . .that. . .great, I fumbled for words. What I wanted to say was Tell me more about
why I am great.
Are you kidding me? Neel said and counted on his fingers. You are smart, successful, fun to
talk to, young, hard-working, funny and, well, I shouldnt be saying this as your senior, but you
know. . . He paused mid-sentence.
You knowwhat? I said.
I dont want to talk out of turn.
Its okay.
Well, you know, you look pretty good. Very good, in fact.
Wow, did Neel Gupta just try a line on me? But wait, did Neel Gupta actually find me goodlooking?
And did he mean all those other wonderful things he just said?
I felt loads of self-esteem shots being injected into my bloodstream.
You are just saying all this to make me feel good, I said. It meant, say more.
No. Why would I? I mean it. You are, professionally and personally, one of the most amazing
people I have ever met, Neel said.
I swear I felt the sand shift beneath me. Neel stared me right in the eyes. We had a moment of
silence as I heard the splashing waves. I absorbed his compliment. Someone as cool as Neel found
me attractive. It was all too much. Something had to short-circuit in me as I gave the most idiotic
response.
Its okay if I send Marcos the term sheet by tomorrow evening, right? I said.
One month later
Whole-wheat toast. Faa sang zoeng mat, I said. I had finally learnt to order breakfast at the
Goldman café. Neel and I were the early arrivals, at 7.30 a.m.
Neel took his black coffee and a bowl of oats. A month since our Philippines visit, we had the
term sheet signed. We had also reached settlement with the banks.
I cant tell you the details. But I have good news, Neel said.
We have a buyer? I said, excited.
Shh! Neel said and placed a finger on his lips. Yes. We could be going to meet Marcos soon
and finish the deal.
Cool, I said. Take over the loans on one side and sell the company on the other.
What we call back-to-back deals. No risk on books. Best deal ever, Neel said. We gave each
other a thumbs-up. He reviewed the deal-closing documents.
Looks good. Fingers crossed. Buyer on board soon, Neel said.
I put the documents back in my laptop bag. These last few minutes of our daily café meeting
had become my favourite part of the day. It was when Neel and I discussed things apart from work.
How is your new apartment? Neel said.
I love it. Thirtieth floor, great view. Still doing it up, I said.
Check out IKEA, they have good home stuff. Neat designs, good price, Neel said.
Sure. Will go there. Need to join a gym too.
Have you tried yoga?
I shook my head. Maybe at school in India, I said, when it was compulsory.
Neel laughed.
Check out Pure Yoga. They have a great studio. I go sometimes, Neel said.
Okay. My birthday is coming up next week. Maybe I will treat myself to a membership.
Oh, great. Happy birthday in advance.
Thanks. So you do yoga too. How do you do it all? I said.
If you love yourself, you will take care of yourself, right?
I counted the twenty-six pink roses. The bouquet on my desk had a maroon ribbon wrapped around it.
It came from Armani Fiori, located in Central. Part of the Armani brand of Italian designer Giorgio
Armani, the bouquets in the shop would be no less than 200 dollars at least. I removed a small white
envelope tied to one of the roses. A card inside said, Happy BirthdayFrom the team.
I sat back in my seat, surprised. The hard-nosed and tough Distressed Debt Group isnt known
for affection and flowers. Bianca passed my cubicle.
Happy birthday, Radhika, she said.
Thank you, I said, and thanks for the flowers. The most beautiful bouquet I have ever seen.
You are welcome. We dont normally do it. But you are new. Maybe thats why Neel wanted
it.
Neel?
Yes, he told me to order it. He even selected the arrangement.
I thanked everyone for the birthday wishes in the team meeting.
The flowers are an exception. Dont get high hopes, Josh said.
Mostly we gift each other bad loan documents, Simon said. The team burst into laughter. I
looked at Neel. He smiled at me.
A team from the Metropolitan Bank of Tokyo is in town. They want to meet for potential coinvestments,
he said, making it clear that the bouquet and my birthday didnt warrant any more
discussion.
Thats Tanaka-san, Shin-san and I am Sugimula, said Arai Sugimura, head of the Distressed Debt
Group at Metropolitan Bank of Tokyo, as he introduced his team. In Japan, the tag san is applied out
of respect, sort of like shri in Hindi. We exchanged business cards, held in both hands, as is the
norm in Asia.
La-dhi-ka-san, Arai said. Do I say youl name light?
Its fine, I said and smiled. The Japanese bankers bowed to us as they sat down. Bianca
asked us if we needed anything. Everyone agreed to have Chinese tea.
Its an honour you came to visit us, Neel said, turning on his client-charm button. How can
we do business together?
Gupta-san, it is plivilege for us too, Arai said. Goldman Sachs is ples-ti-gious bank. Youl
gloup has good leputation in malket.
Bianca came back with teacups and a kettle of tea. She placed them on the table and left.
Thank you. Its all due to my great team, Neel said, waving his hand at us.
Neel poured tea for himself. As did Josh and Peter.
La-dhika-san, Arai said.
Yes? I said.
Would you mind? he said and pointed to the kettle. I realized he wanted me to pour tea for his
team. I looked at Neel and Josh. They seemed confused, but gestured that I do it anyway. I poured tea
for the Japanese team and a cup for myself.
Arai explained his desire to co-invest with our group. Nobody else from Arais team spoke a
word. In Japan, when the boss talks, you remain silent.
So what kind of deals al you looking at? Arai said. Any polt-folios?
Arai had the typical Japanese problem of being unable to speak the R sound, which he
substituted with L.
Radhika bid for one recently, maybe she can talk about it, Josh said.
La-dhika-san? Arai said.
Yeah, I can tell you about this local Bank of East Asia auction. . . I began to speak but Arai
interrupted me with his laughter.
Excuse me? I said, wondering if I had said anything wrong.
Solly. I thought La-dhika-san youl secle-taly. How can lady do dist-lessed debt? Arai
continued to laugh. His minions also grinned, taking their bosss cue.
Neel pursed his lips. He looked at me once and turned to Arai.
The young lady here is one of our best distressed debt analysts, Neel said.
Yes, yes, of coulse. By the way, I lemember a joke when you said lady, Arai said.
None of us responded. He continued, You know what they say about lady? He turned to Josh.
Josh didnt answer.
Arai continued anyway, When a lady say no, she means maybe. When she says maybe, she
means yes. When she says yes, well, she is not a lady.
His colleagues found the joke extra funny and laughed out loud. Peter, Josh, Neel and I looked
at each other.
Arai-san, I understand this is amusing to you. But frankly, this makes us quite uncomfortable,
Neel said.
Solly. You may continue, Arai said.
I took a deep breath to regain my composure. I spoke again.
Yes, so I was saying, I said.
Neel stood up.
Actually, no, Neel said and paused before he spoke again. No. This wont work out.
What? Arai said, his face serious.
We look for fit in a partner. Sorry, Arai-san, we wont be able to do business with you, Neel
said.
We have billion dollals to invest. Lot of fee for Goldman Sachs on that. Arai looked
stupefied.
I understand, Neel said, but. . .
Actually, its okay, Neel, I said. Arai-san, if I can tell you about the portfolio. . .
Neel shook his head.
Arai-san, Tanaka-san, Shin-san, thank you for coming. I am sure you will find a great partner.
We will pass. We anyway have a lot on our plate, Neel said. Josh and Peter stood up, somewhat
surprised. The Japanese bankers looked at each other.
Josh will see you out, Neel said and left the room.
Hey, Radhika, come on in, Neel said.
I went into his office and sat down in front of him. He wore a pink shirt and a red Hermes tie.
His face reflected a bit of pink from his shirt.
By the way, happy birthday, he said.
Thank you for the flowers.
They are from the team, Neel said.
Bianca told me you chose them.
Oh, she did? She doesnt understand confidentiality. Neel grinned.
He played with his cuffs. He would do that when he was nervous. Or excited.
Neel, about the meeting with the Japanese bankers. . .
Yeah. What douchebags.
You cancelled the deal?
Well, we cant work with sexist people like that. They made you so uncomfortable.
I was taken aback a bit, yes. But an odd comment here or there doesnt bother me.
Its not okay, Radhika, Neel said, raising his voice loud enough for even Bianca to notice.
There was business there, I said.
So? Neel said.
I looked at him. We exchanged a glance. I dont know if I imagined it, but it lasted a heartbeat
longer than it should have between a partner and an associate.
Listen, Radhika. I am not going to allow anyone to treat you like this, he said and
immediately corrected himself. I mean, not going to allow anyone in my team to be treated like that.
All right. But I was fine, I said.
No. Dont be fine. No business is worth that. We can let it go, okay?
I looked at Neel.
Thanks, I said in a subdued voice.
You are welcome, he said. Now, what are your birthday plans?
I have a few calls with prospective El Casa buyers tonight.
Gosh, you are incorrigible, Neel said.
Its not so bad. Simon has organized drinks. A couple of Goldman associates are coming.
Nice. Have fun, he said.
I wondered if I should invite him. He read my mind.
I would have come, but it will be awkward for the rest if a partner shows up.
I understand. No issues, I said.
Happy birthday again, Radhika, he said.
I came back to my desk. I touched the petals of one of the twenty-six roses. My phone rang. I
had a call from India. I picked up the phone.
Hey, sister, Aditi didi said. Happy birthday. I came home today. We miss you.

One month later
ere you go, whole-wheat toast with peanut butter and honey, Neel said and passed me my
breakfast. I gestured him a thanks with a thumbs-up. I was on a conference call. I was now vice
president; my expected promotion had become official two weeks ago. We sat in the Goldman café at
7 a.m. We had a potential buyer for El Casa called Greenwood Hospitality, a US-based company that
owned fifty boutique hotels worldwide. On the call were Maddox Dean, MD in the mergers
department in New York; Philippe Greenwood, owner of Greenwood; Neel and I.
Philippe, the docs are watertight here. I think we should close this soon, Neel said.
I dont mind, Philippe said, just that your price of fifty million is too high. How about
forty?
Neel looked at me. I shook my head.
Too low, Neel said.
Lets lock at forty-five, Greenwood said.
Neel looked at me.
I nodded.
Done, Neel said. Can we close the docs soon, please?
This is fantastic, Maddox said. We have a deal.
Super. Well go down to the Philippines and close it with El Casa next week, Neel said.
The call ended.
Congratulations, I said.
How much is the final profit? Neel said.
Twenty million, net, to us, I said.
Neel and I high-fived each other.
How did you guys do it? Marcos said, as he flipped through the documents. Even though he tried to
hide it, the smile wouldnt leave his face. He had a bankrupt business that faced foreclosure and mass
lay-offs. Now he would get five million dollars next week in his account as a settlement fee for his
cooperation. Not to mention a global buyer who would keep his resorts alive.
Thats what we do. We close deals, Marcos, Neel said.
Wonderful. You are staying for several days this time, I hope, Marcos said as he signed the
documents. Stay on a different island each night.
I wish, Neel said. But theres a lot of work back in Hong Kong. We will leave tomorrow.
Same place then? Pengalusian?
Yes, Neel said.
You saved my people their jobs. Thank you so much, he said.
I collected all the documents Marcos had signed. Neel shook hands with Marcos.
Pleasure doing business with you, Neel said.
I stood in front of the mirror at the Pengalusian Island Resort and turned from side to side. I wondered
if my black shorts and the white gunjee over my pink sports bra revealed too much. Neel had
suggested a run before our deal-closing celebration dinner. Lets burn calories before we consume
them, he had said.
Its fine. Be cool about it, I said to myself and checked myself out one last time. Okay, so the
shorts were a little too short. The gunjee was, well, a little too short too.
I met Neel at the reception area. He wore a blue workout T-shirt and black cycling shorts. He
also had blue mirror-tinted Raybans on.
Wow, youve transformed, he said. The sunglasses covered his eyes. I couldnt tell if he was
staring at me. I thought he did. Maybe I wished he did.
I havent run in the longest time, I said.
Well just jog. Three rounds of the island?
Two, please.
He laughed.
Okay, lets go, he said.
We jogged around the periphery of the tiny island. We had walked this route on our previous
trip. However, today the island felt even more dreamlike. Despite the bright sun, a cool breeze kept
the temperature just right. We jogged on the beach away from the water, which slapped lazily against
the shore. Neel ran slower to match my pace. This way he remained only a few steps ahead of me. I
noticed his muscular legs. He had perfect, sculpted calves. He ran in flawless, graceful form. I,
meanwhile, gasped, kicked and panted through the two-kilometre route. I wanted to quit after the first
round. However, Neel wouldnt let me.
Enough, I said, holding my stomach.
Come on, you are doing great, he said.
For the second round he remained behind me. I looked back from the corner of my eye. I dont
know if he noticed my legs. It would have been hard to miss them, considering my shorts bunched up
even more when I ran.
I am done, I said, gasping for breath as I finished the second round.
Mind if I run a bit more? he said.
Sure, I said and exhaled noisily.
See you in an hour for dinner, he said and ran ahead. Soon, he disappeared into the sand and
green foliage of the island.
I went back to my room and showered. I opened my suitcase and took out a white flowing
dress with a floral print. It seemed perfect for an island resort dinner. The dress had a deep neckline;
I wore a bead necklace to cover it. I applied make-up, and created a smoky effect around my eyes. I
realized I had not dressed up to look good since my New York days with Debu. Also, I noticed the
name Debu didnt sting as much anymore. I applied perfume and translucent strawberry lip gloss. I
looked at myself in the mirror one final time. If I made an effort I could look nice.
Will he like how I look? The question floated in my head. Mini-me scolded me, He may be
friendly, but hes still a partner, and married. Get it?
I
26
arrived at the restaurant before Neel. I sipped a glass of champagne as I watched the sunset. He
arrived twenty minutes later.
Sorry I am late. I ran extra rounds, Neel said.
He wore a linen T-shirt and beige shorts.
Its okay, I said. He pulled out a chair and sat in front of me.
Wow, he said, his gaze on me.
What? I said.
You look. . .well, different, he said.
Good different or bad different? I said.
You look stunning, actually. This dress really suits you.
He had given me his first direct compliment about my looks. While working on El Casa we
had become freer in terms of talking to each other. However, we still maintained propriety. We didnt
discuss feelings, for instance. We didnt make personal comments. In fact, we never even called each
other a friend.
And yet, today his compliment didnt feel out of place.
Thank you, Neel. Thats sweet of you, I said. There, I had become so much better at taking a
compliment.
He removed his Birkenstock sandals so his feet could touch the sand. I kicked off my heels
too.
Wheres my drink? Neel said and signalled the waiter. The waiter poured champagne for
him.
So how do you feel after the run? Neel said.
Good, I said, but I need to build my stamina. People older than me are whipping me and
doing extra rounds.
Neel grinned. The waiter brought us the set menu choices. I chose the vegetarian option. It
consisted of an avocado and rocket leaf salad, followed by mushroom truffle pasta. Neel chose a
seafood chowder soup and pan-seared salmon cooked in a mango salsa.
To El Casa, your first big deal in Asia, Neel said and raised his glass.
To Greenwood, their new buyer. I touched his glass with mine.
What a resort, isnt it? Neel said. He pointed to the scenery ahead of us. Only half of the sun
remained on the horizon. The deep orange-coloured sky had turned a silky texture.
The most beautiful place I have ever been to, I said.
Same for me. With one of the most beautiful minds I know, Neel said.
Yeah, sure. Its only my mind thats beautiful, I said. I am a fisherwoman. I fish, fish, fish.
Of course not. But it isnt appropriate for me to comment on the rest of you. Protocol, he
said.
We need to get something straight, I said and sat upright.
What? Neel said.
Are we friends or are we colleagues or are you my super-senior boss? I said.
Thats a tough one, Neel said.
Is it?
Well, yes. Fact remains I am the head of the group. You are the VP. Cheers.
We touched glasses again. I look a big gulp.
So thats who we are. Colleagues? I said.
Well, no. I feel like after all those breakfast meetings I know you somewhat. You know me
too. In fact. . . he said and paused.
In fact what?
In fact, I am going to miss our breakfast chats the most after this deal, he said and stared into
the horizon. Our oatmeal and peanut-butter-toast conversations.
Dont forget the honey, I said.
He laughed.
I will miss our breakfasts too, I said.
Well, life goes on. Another day, another deal, Neel said.
Wait. So we are not friends?
Can we be?
Why not? I said.
Many reasons to not be. I am your senior. Twenty years older. Married. Two kids. You, on the
other hand, young and single. Smart and attractive.
Attractive? I said and smiled.
Yeah, of course. You are really attractive, Radhika. I am just being factual.
Ah, the sweet, soothing feeling of receiving a compliment from a worthy man.
My life, at this moment, felt perfect.
Thank you, I said. You are pretty cool too.
What is this? An overworked bankers self-praise society? Neel said.
We laughed. The waiter refilled our champagne glasses.
We are friends, Neel said. I dont see you as a junior now.
Do note I get too casual with friends. Tell me if I overstep the line. After all, you are my
senior, I said.
I am not the typical senior. You can be honest with me. Speak your mind.
Really?
Yeah. Try me, Neel said.
Okay. What do you truly think of me? I said. As a person.
He wiped the water droplets on his glass with his thumb.
Go on, hit me. Be frank, I said.
He smiled.
You are smart, of course. But you are also simple and a little lost. You are one of the most
attractive women I have met. Yet you need external validation, a lot of it. This could be because you
have self-esteem issues. You are sensitive, but have closed yourself. After what has happened in New
York perhaps.
Wow, was all I could say, impressed and speechless at his observations.
A bit too frank? he said.
Yeah, ouch, I said and laughed. But not bad. You do observe more about me than the
financial models I create.
Oh, but your work is stellar. You could be partner one day. Radhika Mehta, Partner, Goldman
Sachs. Heres to that, Neel said and raised a toast. He finished his glass in one shot. I followed him.
The cloudless sky looked even more beautiful as little stars became visible at dusk. A slow French
song began to play in the background. I couldnt understand the lyrics, but could feel the pain of the
singer.
Partner Radhika. With a lot of deals under her belt. But lonely, without love, I said.
What nonsense. Radhika with a lot of love, Neel said.
Whatever. I dont think so. Which song is this? Its beautiful.
La vie en rose. Life through rose-tinted glasses. Famous French song. But seriously, thats
what you think? You wont find love?
Yeah. My biggest fear, perhaps.
Neel gave me a look of disbelief.
You want to talk about New York? he said.
The waiter brought us another champagne bottle. Over the course of dinner and a few more
glasses of bubbly, I told him my entire New York story. He listened with full attention, nodding at
every significant moment.
And so, thats it. I dropped the phone in the East River. Came to Hong Kong, I said.
I wiped a slow tear rolling down my cheek. I didnt think of Debu much now. However,
repeating the story was not a breeze.
You could have just dropped the SIM card, you know. And wiped the phone to factory
settings, Neel said.
I looked at Neel. He kept a poker face. I dont know why, but we burst out laughing.
Its okay, crap happens in life. Mostly its for the good, Neel said.
More champagne, sir? the waiter said as he picked up our second empty bottle.
Actually, no. I am pretty. . . Neel said as I interrupted him.
Actually, yes. Wed like another one, I said.
Really? Neel said, looking at me as the waiter left.
Well, I have told you a lot about me. We still have to cover you. We need a drink for that.
Neel shrugged and smiled.
Okay, bring it on, he said. Whats your read on me, as a person?
Well, I said, resting my left palm on my glass. You are a bit of an enigma.
Enigma?
Yeah, mysterious. You are smart, clearly an overachiever. Fit, good-looking, charming.
I could get used to this. Go on, Neel said.
But. . . I said.
But what?
I dont know if you are truly happy. You should be, right? You have everything the world
aspires for, right? But you dont seem truly happy.
I am happy. Look at me. Being paid to be on an island.
Yeah, you get paid. A lot. But thats not all it takes to be happy.
He didnt respond. He looked searchingly at me.
What makes you think I am not happy? he said slowly.
I feel you put on a mask. This perfect mask. Hard-working family man, controls his diet,
exercises regularly. Its almost too perfect. Like your perfectly ironed shirts, there isnt an out-ofplace
crease. You know what they say in due diligence, right?
What?
If it is too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true, I said.
He looked at me, his eyes wide in surprise. He put his glass down.
Did I cross the line? I said, a little anxious.
He shook his head.
No, no. Its okay. What else makes you feel this way?
You never talk about your family.
I do. I told you. Kusum. My two kids.
Factual stuff.
Meaning?
Its like data. No feelings.
Okay, Neel said. Wow. You learn something every day. So thats what you think about me.
I am sorry if I said something inappropriate.
No, its cool, he said and smiled.
The waiter cleared our dinner plates. He brought us mango with sticky rice as dessert. I cut a
piece of mango with my knife and ate it with a fork.
Your wife is happy for all your success? I said.
Yeah, Neel said, after some deliberation. She is. We have been together twenty years. She
has seen my entire journey.
Twenty years? Wow, so you guys met when I was five, I said.
Ouch! Neel grinned. Now you make me feel really old.
What is it like being married for so long? I said.
Its nice. You build a life together, a lot of memories together. You bring kids into this world.
Yeah, does sound beautiful.
And yet, because you have been with a person so long, it doesnt stay the same. Issues crop
up. Many issues. Many, many issues.
I sensed Neel had stuff bottled up.
Okay. Well, you can talk about it if you want, I said.
I am not going to bore you. I dont have an exciting story with iPhones being thrown off the
Brooklyn Bridge. Just stupid domestic stuff.
Hey, I had an old iPhone. I would have upgraded to a new model anyway.
Both of us laughed.
You are funny, he said.
We finished our meal.
I ate too much, I said.
Me too. Lets take a walk?
Another walk? You are Mr Hyperactive, arent you? I said.
He grinned. He picked up a flashlightthere was one on every table. I lifted two glasses and
the unfinished third bottle of champagne.
What? Neel said.
We will take this along, I said.
Kind of defeats. . . Neel said and I nudged him.
Come, I said. We walked barefoot on the same route as our jog a couple of hours ago.
However, the island took on a new form in the darkness. The trees appeared pitch black, as did the
sea. I could see white streaks where the waves broke, due to the phosphorescence and the moonlight.
We walked close to the shore this time. The water lapped at our feet, warm on our ankles. Neels
flashlight showed us the way. We walked in silence, with no sound apart from the splashing waves.
The lack of conversation didnt seem awkward. In fact, it seemed perfect. I spoke after a while.
You must be tired, I said. You ran five rounds.
A little bit, Neel said but walked on.
We reached the northern tip of the island, which had a C-shaped alcove. The waves became
gentle here and made no sound. Rock formations on the beach jutted out of the sand. At a distance we
could see fishing boats as nearby islanders went out for a nights catch.
Can we sit for a bit? I said.
Sure, he said.
We sat down on the cold sand in absolute silence. He switched off the flashlight. The
moonlight was just about enough for us to see each others faces. I poured myself a glass of
champagne. He looked at me, shook his head in disbelief and grinned. I poured him a glass as well.
He took a sip. I turned my head back to look up at the sky.
The night sky had so many stars, it felt like someone had sprayed it with silver paint.
Wow, look at the gazillion stars above, I said.
He turned his gaze up to the sky as well.
Unlike Hong Kong there is no pollution here, and no backlight from the city.
Yeah, I have never seen stars in Hong Kong, I said.
Do you recognize constellations? Neel said.
I shook my head. He pointed at the sky with his index finger.
See, thats Ursa Major, or the Great Bear, he said, outlining the group of seven stars.
I kept looking at his finger. He kept talking.
Thats Ursa Minor, Little Bear. Thats the North Star, Neel said.
How do you know all this? I said.
Used to have a telescope once. Can you imagine, these stars are all navigators had when they
sailed centuries ago. No GPS.
Unbelievable, I said.
My neck hurt from keeping my head tilted for so long. I lay down on the sand instead. This
way my eyes could face the sky above me and I could be comfortable.
Easier to see this way, I said. Neel looked at me once and lay down as well. Our heads were
one foot apart.
Whats your sun sign? he said, staring at the sky above.
My birthday was just a few days back, I said.
Gemini then. There, see, those are the Gemini twins, he said.
Whats yours?
Taurus. See, over there, he said. He pointed to a group of stars that outlined a bull.
Wow, I said.
We became quiet and enjoyed the silence and isolation. I felt calm because of the
surroundings. Maybe the champagne also had something to do with it. I could hear him breathing. I
stretched my legs. A wave touched my foot. I moved in reflex. As I did that, my ankle brushed against
Neels. He turned his head and looked at me.
I am sorry, I said.
Its fine, he said, rather whispered. We looked at each other and smiled. I dont know why,
call it girl intuition or whatever, I felt like something was going to happen. I could have moved away.
But I didnt. Maybe because I wanted it to happen.
He leaned forward. He placed his lips on mine. They felt as warm and gentle as the water on
my ankles. I closed my eyes. My hands moved halfway to stop him but lost the resolve to do so as the
kiss felt amazing. He kissed me long and deep as dozens of waves broke and touched the soles of my
feet. He lifted his arm to draw me closer. Neel Gupta, partner, two decades older and my bosss boss,
held me tight and kissed me. This was not supposed to feel good. But never had a kiss felt this good. I
didnt protest. Maybe I should have. But when something feels so right it is hard to do so. I placed my
palm on his face. The face I had seen every day for so many months, but never touched. I felt
connected to him. I felt like the entire island existed only for this one reason, our kiss.
A relatively stronger wave came and hit us higher, leaving us wet from the waist down.
He continued to kiss me, the intensity increasing with every passing second. His fingers
lingered down the back of my neck. Goosebumps broke out all over my body. If he could kiss like
this. . . His other hand went to my thigh and my heart started to thump louder.
Should I stop him? I wondered. I placed my hand on his wrist but offered no resistance.
Another strong wave came up and wet my entire dress. His fingers stroked my thighs.
Am I really doing this? my rational mind asked me one last time in a meek voice while I
moaned. Nobody cared about the rational mind tonight. My hand slid under his linen T-shirt, already
wet due to the water. I touched his hard chest, and circled my index finger around his left nipple. He
bit my lower lip in excitement.
We sat up. He removed his shirt, keeping his shorts on. He pulled up my dress and had me
wriggle out of it. We lay down again, the cold sand under our backs. He kissed my navel, touching his
tongue to it. My knees lifted a little. I grabbed his head with my hands.
Neel, I whispered. He didnt hear me. His mouth and fingers continued to explore me. He
traced my bra with a lazy finger. He took his time, to match the slow pace of the island. After a while,
he lifted me a little. His hand went behind me and unhooked my bra in one snap. My breasts felt the
cold breeze. He paused to look at them, whatever he could see in the moonlight.
He touched a nipple with his fingertip. Took a breast in his hand. I could feel myself melting
all over. When my hand brushed over his shorts I knew he was as turned on as I was, if not more. His
mouth was on my breasts.
I lifted my hips and he pulled down my underwear. Then we were both naked on the sandy
beach. He leaned over me again and kissed my inner thighs. His tongue reached down there and
kissed me intimately. I almost jumped up in excitement.
Like all his kisses, he kept this light and slow, till I began to tremble. His tongue began to
gather pace. The pleasure became unbearable. I arched my back. Debu had gone down on me before.
However, this was a completely new level of sensation and pleasure. If Debu was French fries, this
was a gourmet six-course meal. If Debu was beer, this was champagne. If Debu was a boat, this was
a luxury cruise. Stop comparing, and whats with the weird analogies? I mentally scolded myself,
and refocused on the moment. Neel continued to work magic with his tongue. I arched my back further
and dug my fingers in his hair.
Everything good? he whispered.
I didnt respond. I couldnt. I simply nodded. It wasnt just good. It was divine, sublime,
insane Philippines-exclusive-island-level good.
I could feel the build-up of an orgasm within me, as could he. I squeezed his face between my
thighs. I came, hard. He lifted himself up and brought his face close to mine. He used his arm to gently
part my legs and entered me. He moved with gentle and firm strokes. I felt the build-up again and I
came a second time, more intensely than the first. My body shook, I closed my eyes, and I blacked out
for at least thirty seconds. This one orgasm had the intensity of ten orgasms.
He paused after I came and pulled out of me. He brought his face close to mine and gently
pecked me on the cheek.
You okay? he said, his voice tender.
That. . . I said as I gasped for breath. That. . .was something else. How on earth did you do
that?
He simply grinned in response. In embarrassment, I covered my face with my hands. He gently
removed my hands and looked into my eyes.
He entered me again. He felt bigger than before. I clutched his shoulders as we continued to
make love. Water hit us from time to time. We kissed till I felt his shoulder spasm under my hand and
he groaned.
He looked into my eyes and smiled. He played with my eyelashes. He put his arm around me
as we lay down side by side, facing each other.
That was. . . he whispered and paused to take a breath before he spoke again, something
else.
I know, I whispered back.
The stars twinkled above us. My day had started early with a morning flight in Hong Kong.
Our frantic lovemaking made me feel tired. Fatigue took over. I closed my eyes.
T

he sun has a way of making everything visible, even your blunders. When dawn broke I opened
my eyes. I blinked, trying to orient myself. The seawater glistened in front of me but my mouth
felt parched. I felt a headache coming on. Water, I needed water. Neel lay next to me, fast asleep.
No way, I mumbled. No way, Radhika. No way.
I smacked my forehead. I found my clothes next to me. I wore them as quietly and quickly as
possible. I stood up, wondering if I should wake Neel up. I decided not to. I picked up the glasses and
the empty champagne bottle, the catalyst to last nights disaster, and walked back. The sun rose higher.
I walked fast. I didnt want to face Neel right now. In fact, I didnt want to face him ever.
Back in my room I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling.
Fuck, I said out loud. What the fuck have you done, Radhika?
I lay there motionless. A million thoughts ran through my mind. What did I just do? I slept
with a partner at Goldman Sachs. I slept with a man twenty years older than me. I realized Neel
was just ten years younger than my father.
Radhika, how could you do it? Mini-me jumped out of her cave. All of a sudden, mini-me had
full authority.
There is something wrong, something totally fucked up about you. You are just a bloody
useless little idiot.
My happy mood from yesterday had evaporated. Life had just begun to sort itself out. I had
closed a great deal. I had been promoted. I had even somewhat gotten over Debu. All this had given
me a new shot of self-esteem. Now it meant nothing. I curled up in my bed in tears. Mini-me
continued to talk, or rather yell at me.
Hes fucking married. He has two kids. There is a wife. They are all waiting in Hong Kong,
where both of you live.
Yes, it was true. And I had known it all before. What was I thinking? Or rather, why was I not
thinking?
Life is not a private island in the Philippines, mini-me shouted at me.
I know, I know. I had nothing to counter my inner voice with.
This is why Debu left you. Something is wrong with you, seriously, you stupid, slutty bitch.
I sobbed. I dont know why, but I cried and cried. I had crossed the line. Hell, I had not just
crossed, but jumped and leaped miles over the line.
You had one thing going for you, your career. Now you have fucked that up too, mini-me
said.
I berated myself for a long time. I realized I had to get up. I had to shower, pack and leave on a
seaplane in an hour. I didnt know how to face him. I didnt want to. Could we go back on separate
flights? Could I just go drown in the sea outside?
I wondered where Neel was. What if he didnt wake up? Should I call him?
I heard a knock on my door. I froze. I opened the door to find one of the hotel staff.
Madam, your shoes. You left them in the restaurant last night.
Oh, sure, thanks, I said.
I returned sirs shoes to his room.
Great. Was he there?
Yes, he was. He asked me to tell you to meet in the seaplane reception area in thirty minutes.
Sure, I said, relieved. I didnt have to talk to him just yet. I showered and changed into a
charcoal-grey suit. It was too formal and a misfit for my location but apt for my mental state. As if he
would see me in this work suit again and things would be back to normal.
Funnily enough, he did seem pretty normal.
Hey, good morning, he said and smiled. He wore sunglasses, just like me. We had found a
way to avoid eye contact.
Hi, I said.
All set? Time to say goodbye to the Pengalusian, he said. His voice seemed casual. He
seemed calm, unlike the neurotic mess I was.
We sat in the plane. The pilot gave a thumbs-up as we took off. I ignored the beautiful scenery
below us, as my mind was flooded with doubts. Instead of regret, another set of thoughts gripped me.
How is he so calm and casual? Did it mean nothing to him?
I looked out of the window, away from him. My mind was on nothing but him.
Is this a regular thing for him? He doesnt think this was special? Have there been other
girls? Oh, am I also just a conquest now? I hate him.
The seaplane landed. We stepped out and took a car to the Palawan airport. He looked at me. I
looked away. We reached the airport and took our connecting flights back to Hong Kong. On the way,
we spoke little, limiting ourselves to stupid conversations like Wheres the gate? at the transit
airport in Manila or Can you pass the pepper? during our meal in the Cathay Pacific aircraft.
I dont know why grown-ups behave in such a stupid manner. Pepper seemed more important
than anything else. I opened my laptop and pretended to work. He did the same. My mind raced up
and down with thoughts. I have been such a fool. He will go home, tick another box in his conquest
list and laugh about it. He will be like, that Indian VP chick? Check. Been there, done that desi
babe. Damn it, Radhika. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
We landed in Hong Kong. We went to the airport car pick-up point. We waited for our
respective cars, which Bianca had booked for us. Our two black cars arrived. I proceeded to step
into mine.
Radhika, Neel said.
Yeah, I said and turned to him.
I know you probably have a million thoughts in your head. So do I.
What thoughts? I said. Excuse me?
Lets pretend nothing happened. That would be a mature way to deal with it, right?
About last night? he said, puzzled.
I shrugged my shoulders.
Havent really had a chance to think about it, I said. Yeah, more like, havent thought of
anything but that.
Well, I have been thinking about it all day.
Good, mister, at least it freaking matters. Go on, I said in my head as I continued to look at
him.
And while I am still working through my thoughts, I just wanted you to know that last night
was special for me. I can tell you, havent felt that way before.
Oh, I said, my mouth open. I did not expect that. Oh okay, well, I said and went into
clueless and silent bimbette mode. I looked at him with a blank face.
Yeah, it was tender and wonderful and touching and so many things, Neel said, moving his
hands around as he spoke.
Thats interesting, I said.
Okay, what kind of an idiotic response is that? Interesting? Like really, Radhika?
Interesting? he said, surprised at my stupid response.
I better go. See you later, I said. The driver opened my car door.
Sure, he said and waved at me. He looked pained at what would have seemed to him my
indifference. The car drove off the airport terminal. I noticed him continue looking at my car until he
went out of sight.
My car zipped along the highway as Hong Kongs flickering skyscraper lights became visible
again.
Pretend it never happened, maybe that will mean it never did, I said to myself as the car
reached my home.
O

Two weeks later
kay, enough. We do need to discuss what happened, Neel said.
Why? I said. Neel had called me to his office. We sat facing each other at his desk.
Because its not good to not talk about it. Youve been avoiding me ever since we came back
from the Philippines.
I studied my fingernails. What is there to talk about? It was wrong.
Well, he said and paused before he spoke again. Define wrong.
It was wrong, Neel. And you know it, I said, looking up.
Okay, maybe it was a little wrong. But it felt right.
Really?
Didnt it? Didnt it feel just right?
It doesnt matter, Neel. I started counting on my fingers. I work for you. You are married.
You are a dad.
I am aware of that.
So then what is this all about? Let it be a one-off. A one-off blunder. And lets move on.
He stood up restlessly and walked to the window. Staring into the harbour he spoke again. I
cant call it a blunder. How does one call the most special experience of ones life a blunder?
He has a way with words. Be careful, I told myself.
Call it what you want. Point is, it was not real. We can put it down to the setting, the drinks,
the air. . . It wont happen again. It wont, I said, my voice as agitated as his was quiet.
Neel came back to his seat and sat across from me.
He held his chin with his right hand.
Okay, okay, calm down, Neel said. I get it.
We should focus on work, I said briskly.
Fine. We cool then, otherwise?
Yeah, I said.
So if theres another deal I want to staff you on, I can?
Of course. You are the boss.
Even if it is with me?
Do you have to staff me in particular?
Greenwood wants to buy some more distressed hotels in Korea. They want us to look at some
options. They liked your work. So. . . He left the sentence hanging.
Whatever you say, I said.
I wont staff you if you dont want to. Should I say you are not available?
So I lose my clients now? I said.
Of course not. You are on. The target company is in Seoul. Lets go there soon.
I am looking for a sofa. A two-seater, please, I said.
Would you like a simple sofa or a sofa bed? the salesperson said.
I had come to IKEA, the Swedish furniture store, on the weekend. The huge, 20,000-squarefeet
IKEA store is located in Causeway Bay.
Sofa bed, I said. At some point, if I had guests from India, I would need to provide a place to
sleep. The IKEA salesperson led me to the sofa bed area.
There were a dozen models, from Japanese futons to clever snap-shut mechanisms.
Do you have a colour preference? the salesperson said.
Not really. How about the steel grey right there? I pointed at one.
Oh, thats a bestseller. Comfortable and minimalist, she said.
I sat on the sofa to see how it felt.
Good, I said. I like it.
Hi. Someone waved at me from a distance.
I looked up. Neel? I said.
He stood at the other corner of the sofa section.
Hi, he said again as I walked up to him. Good to see you here. We came for some easy
chairs. Here, meet Kusum. Kusum, meet Radhika, from my office.
An Indian woman, around forty years old, stood next to him. A three-year-old boy held one of
her fingers. A seven-year-old girl sitting on one of the IKEA sofas played with an iPhone. A twentysix-
year-old girl, or me, wished for an earthquake that would swallow her deep into the bottom of the
earth.
Radhika, so nice to meet you, Kusum said in an American accent. She extended her hand.
Oh, okay, I said as we shook hands. I mean, hi, Kusum.
This is Aryan. Aryan, say hi to Radhika didi, Neel said. Aryan extended his tiny hand as
well. I shook it. My heart began to beat fast.
And that is Siya. Siya, say hi to didi, Neel said. Siya waved my way without looking up from
her screen.
Not done, Siya, Kusum said in a firm voice. Is that how you greet people?
Siya recognized authority. She put the phone aside and came to me with dainty steps.
Hello, didi. How are you? she said, in a rehearsed formal routine.
I am fine. Thank you, I said.
Thats better. Siya, I dont like bad behaviour, Kusum said.
I guess more than anyone, I was the badly behaved one. I avoided eye contact with Kusum. I
did manage a side-glance. She was slim, elegant and had a straight, upright posture. She was wearing
a long black dress with a diamond necklace and matching earrings, the ones you see advertised
outside the Cartier store in Hong Kong. I noticed a fat solitaire on her ring finger. Three carats, I
guessed.
Sorry, Radhika, just training her. Shes addicted to the phone, Kusum said and smiled.
Its okay, I said, wondering what excuse would allow me the quickest exit.
Neels mentioned you, Kusum continued. You recently moved to Hong Kong, right?
Yeah, six months, I said, wondering what else he had mentioned.
We have been meaning to call the team over to our house. Its my fault, never worked out a
date, Kusum said.
Not a problem, I said. I spoke as little as possible to exhaust conversation so I could leave.
Shopping for home, is it? Neel said. Well, did he have to talk? I felt guilty just being next to
him in front of Kusum. I wished I could hide beneath one of the IKEA sofas.
Yes. I needed a sofa bed, I said.
Where do you put up? Kusum said.
Is she going to come kill me? Will she knock me out with that diamond solitaire?
Old Peak Road, I said.
We are in Repulse Bay. Do come sometime. Do you miss Indian home food? Have her over,
Neel, Kusum said.
Oh, please, please dont be nice to me, I wanted to say.
Yeah, why not? You should come, Neel said, his face as blank as mine.
Maybe sometime. Anyway, I dont want to impose on your family outing, I said, hoping to
escape.
What outing? We just came for some errands. Are you by yourself? Kusum said.
Yes, I am. Single, alone and loveless. No wonder I borrowed your husband.
Yes, I said vaguely. Sunday, so just thought will fix up the house.
I love your dress, by the way, Kusum said.
God, she is actually a nice person. She had praised my simple white lace dress, even though
she probably wore a designer Prada or Gucci outfit herself. She was not a bitch. And that just made
me feel worse.
Its just Zara, I said.
Well, you have the figure for it, she said. She seemed fit too. I looked at her face. She was
pretty, fair and had high cheekbones. I would kill to look like her at forty. I noticed she had a small
bust. My boobs were better. Okay, why on earth am I comparing my body to hers? Is that all we
women are? I am a vice president at Goldman Sachs. Why doesnt that make me feel as smug as
knowing I have bigger boobs than Neels wife? And why am I comparing myself to her at all?
Th. . .thanks, I stammered, remembering she had given me a compliment.
You have lunch plans? she said.
Er, actually, I normally dont eat lunch, I said, making up nonsense as I spoke.
We are just heading to the food court outside IKEA. Feel free to join us, Kusum said.
I looked at Neel. Can the great partner at Goldman Sachs use his brain to get me out of
this?
Yeah, join us. Because it would be great if you can join us, he rambled on, but not if you
dont want to.
I glared at him. What do you mean, not if you dont want to?
Have a salad. Its not good to skip meals, Kusum said.
Oh okay, I said in meek submission.
I understand you must be on a diet. Trust me, I go through the same, Kusum said and smiled at
me.
So now what? Were we bonding together? Wife and mistress? Fuck, did I just call myself
mistress? I am not a mistress. I am a vice president, for Gods sake.
I followed Neels family out of IKEA and to the food court in a daze. I saw taxis out on the
road. I had the urge to jump into one and scoot away or maybe just jump under one of them and die.
Mom, I want French fries with my noodles, Siya said.
No, I will get you some veggies instead, Kusum said. Siya made a face. Kusum glared at her
daughter. Siya got the message and began to eat her lunch. Aryan had home food. Neel ordered a
chicken wrap, Kusum a quinoa salad. I went for fried rice, though I ate it like a little bird, one grain at
a time.
Liking Hong Kong? Kusum said.
Yeah, I said. Compact, convenient. Work is good.
Made some friends? she said.
Well, work people, mostly, I said.
Thats Goldman for you. They make you work so much, you dont have a life outside.
Thats not true, Neel said. I come home on time.
You are a partner. These poor associates and VPs have to do the grunt work.
Neel shrugged.
You have to pay your dues, he said.
I couldnt handle it. JP Morgan for eight years. I just quit.
Oh, you were in banking? I said. Neel never told me that. Well, he never told me anything
about her.
Yeah, equity sales. I had enough. Although busier now with these two little ones. Sometimes I
do wish I could escape to the office.
We dont escape, we work, Neel said.
Yeah, whatever. You at least get weekends. Mothers dont. The errands never stop. That
reminds me, I had to call. . . Kusum opened her Louis Vuitton handbag.
Siya, where is my phone?
Mommy, I stopped using it when you told me to, Siya said, slurping up a noodle.
Oh no. I left it in IKEA. On the sofa. Kusum jumped up. I will just go to the store and
check.
You want me to come? Neel said.
How? Kids and food are all here. No, you stay. I will be back in ten minutes.
Do you want me to go and check? I said. Id do anything to get away from this sweet
domestic scene.
How kind of you to offer. Kusum smiled. Dont worry. I will be back in a minute. Neel will
handle the kids.
She left Neel, Siya, Aryan and me at the food court. I had the most awkward meal of my entire
life. I couldnt talk freely to Neel. Siya might understand, after all.
Eat the vegetables too, Siya, Neel said.
Siya didnt comply. Neel moved over to her and began to feed her with a spoon. I ate my rice
in silence. Aryan ate butterfly-shaped pasta with red sauce from his lunch box. He smeared the red
sauce all over his face and hands. With every bite, Aryan looked messier. I could see Neel wanted to
attend to his son but had to feed his daughter.
Do you mind? he said and gestured to me. I looked around, took a deep breath and slid next
to Aryan. I took a tissue and wiped his face.
Eat slowly, Aryan, okay? I said.
You feedy me, he said.
What? I said.
You feedy me, he said again.
Neel smiled at me. Really, Neel, this is funny to you? Aryan jumped into my lap and handed
me his fork. I fed him with one hand and kept a tissue in my other hand to wipe his mouth.
I didnt expect to run into you, I said.
Well, I had no idea you would be here, Neel said. Siya looked at both of us one after the
other, with an innocent expression. We decided not to pursue the topic further.
You go to daddy office too? Siya said.
Yes, I said. How about you? Which class are you in?
Grade three, she said.
Whats your favourite subject? I said, as Aryan took a bite off the fork.
Math, she said.
Radhika didi is really good at it, Neel said. He looked at me and smiled, as if he meant not
just math.
Are you really smart? Siya said.
I am okay smart, I said.
Enough feedy, Aryan said to me, as he felt neglected.
No, you have to finish your lunch, Aryan, I said. I dont know how I ended up feeding Neels
child. It was awkward, sure. Yet, somehow, seeing Neel taking care of his children made him more
real, more human. Is this what it would be like to have a family? I wondered what Neel thought
when he saw me feed Aryan. His favourite distressed debt analyst could wipe tomato sauce off a
toddlers face too.
Neel looked at me and smiled. Do I make a good family person, Neel?
Found it, Kusum said as she held up her iPhone. She noticed me with Aryan.
Oh my God, I am so sorry. Aryan, you can eat on your own.
I like didi feedy me, he said.
Kusum put out a hand for the fork. I surrendered it. She was staking her claim. She wanted her
family back. Aryan went into his mothers arms. My lap, and even I on the inside, felt empty. I
realized I wanted this too. I wanted kids. I wanted messy pasta dishes. I wanted iPhone-addicted
daughters who had math as their favourite subject.
Say thank you to didi, Kusum said.
Aryan didnt say thanks. He bent forward and kissed me on my cheek. He had his fathers
charm. I melted at the little boys display of love. I wanted to kiss him back. I didnt. I couldnt. How
could I? Its somebody elses family. Will I have a son like this one day? Will I ever have kids?
I better leave, I said. I remembered my part-time help is coming. She doesnt have the keys.
Oh, you havent finished your lunch, Kusum said.
I am quite full. Really, thanks so much, I said.
Really? she said. We hardly spoke.
I am sure we will meet up soon, I said.
Of course, Neel said, adding a comment when there was no need to.
Bye, Siya. Bye, Aryan, I said.
Bye, Feedy Didi, Aryan said and everyone laughed.
Feedy Didi dashed out of the food court.
F

or most women, it is that time of the month. For my mother, it is that time of the week. The time
when she goes hysterical on the phone and wants one thing more than anything else in the world
my marriage.
Not today, mom, please. Any other day, I said.
Why? Its Sunday. Its the only day you are relaxed and can talk properly.
I am not relaxed today, I snapped. I opened my laptop and logged on to Facebook.
Why? Are you working?
No.
So? You are at home, right? Did you go to that Ikka shop to get the sofa bed?
IKEA. Eee-Kee-Aaa.
Whatever. Did you get a sofa bed?
No. I went there this afternoon. I liked one. I didnt get a chance to buy it.
Why?
Leave it, mom. I told you. Not a good day.
How will we come if you dont have a sofa bed?
Ill get it, I promise.
Why are you so irritated?
Because I know what you are going to say.
What?
Register your profile. See some boys. Mom, why are you obsessed with me getting married?
If I dont care what will happen? You will continue buying sofas alone. Is it even a womans
job? To buy furniture?
Dont start, mom, I said. I searched for Debu. He had kept his profile private. I dont know
why, I wanted to see his profile picture. Maybe he was single again.
Okay, listen to just one proposal, she said.
See, I knew it. Thats the only thing you talk about!
Chemists.
Chemists?
I know what you are thinking. But this is a family with six chemist shops in the heart of Delhi.
They even have one opposite AIIMS. Do you know how much business that can do?
Mom, you want my husband to sit in a chemist shop?
He manages the shops. He doesnt just sit there dishing out strips of Crocin.
Whats his qualification? I said.
You have this hang-up about qualification.
Mom, how is education a hang-up? I am an MBA.
So he has done BPharm. He is thinking of doing an MBA, she lowered her volume, through
correspondence.
Correspondence?
You can even do it online these days.
Mom. Bye.
They have a kothi in Bengali Market. The boys own floor has four bedrooms.
I dont care. I am not looking for real estate.
Talk to him once?
Why? Mom, you know I am working abroad. Why would I quit and come for this?
What do you want then? NRI? I can look.
I dont want anyone. Please leave me alone.
What has happened to you today?
I have to go. Bye.
I ended the call. I saw the Facebook page in front of me. Avinash was still Debus friend. I
could ask him. I called Avinash in New York.
Hey, Radhika. Been ages, he said.
Yeah. Whats up? I said.
Just woke up. Sunday morning here. Hows Hong Kong? Work?
Its good. Busy. Hey, Avinash, can I ask you for a quick favour?
Sure.
Promise you wont judge me, or tell anyone.
Sure.
I want you to check Debus profile on Facebook.
Really?
See. You are judging me, right? This idiotic girl who moved continents but cant move on.
No, no. Wait. I am not judging. What do you want me to do?
I will FaceTime you. You point your phone camera to your computer screen. Load Debus
profile on your computer.
He laughed. Thats innovative.
It is also desperate.
Hey, thats fine. FaceTime me.
I gave him a video call.
Here we go. Debashish Sen, Avinash said. I could see his computer screen on my phone. He
zoomed in closer to Debus profile picture. He stood there, grinning, in Central Park with a redhaired
white girl three inches taller than him. My heart sank. He had switched at least two women
after me. I, meanwhile, had run into the wife and kids of the boss I had slept with.
His last post was at a colleagues birthday party. Do you want me to enlarge the picture?
Yeah, sure, I said.
Debu sat at a restaurant table, holding up a bottle of Corona beer. He still had his beard and
curly hair. The tall white girl sat next to him, a glass of wine in her hand. He looked happy. She
looked happy. The wine looked happy. Who did not look happy? Me.
You want to see more? Avinash said.
Thanks, Avinash. Thats enough, I said, my voice flat.
We miss you. Dont you miss New York?
Yeah, I do. Miss you guys, I said.
I finished the call and sat in my bed. I saw the time; it was midnight. I changed into my
nightclothes. As I put my white Zara dress into the laundry bag, I noticed a tiny red pasta sauce stain
on the sleeve. I dont know why but I felt horrible. I felt lonely. I imagined Neel at home, kids in his
lap while he told them bedtime stories. I imagined Kusum wearing designer sleepwear and cuddling
Neel. Why was I imagining all this? How did it matter to me? I knew he had a family all along, right?
My phone buzzed. WhatsApp message from Neel.
Hope you recovered from bumping into me today. Sorry about that.
Okay, so he wasnt spooning in bed with his wife in pretty sleepwear. He was typing a
message to me.
Not your fault, I messaged back.
Strangely, I liked that you met my kids.
Really?
Yeah. They are a huge part of my life. Nice to share it with you.
Somehow, he made it all seem less terrible.
Thats sweet of you to say. They are amazing kids.
Thanks. They liked you. Aryan kept saying Feedy Didi.
I sent a smiley back.
You dont even talk to me these days, Neel sent another message.
Whats the point? I replied.
We can only know the point of talking if we do the talking, right?
Its fine. Nothing to be said. Mistakes happen.
Stop calling it a mistake. Please.
Fine.
Can we talk? Like catch up properly? Instead of avoiding each other.
I dont know, Neel. I am not in a good place.
What happened?
Nothing specific. Just low.
Can I be there for you? At least a little bit?
We will talk later, I said.
We are going to Seoul next week. Can we catch up then?
Sure, I said.
Thank you. Just dont avoid me.
Cant seem to, as it turns out. Even on weekends, I said.
You are funny. Anyway, goodnight.
Goodnight. By the way, Kusum is really sweet.
Thanks, he said. She liked you.
Because she doesnt know me, I said.
Dont say that.
I sent a smiley back. He replied with a long message.
Anyway, Kusum is nice. I am not going to say she is a horrible person, Radhika. But she and I
just dont share that connection. Not even a tenth of what you and I have. None, actually.
I read the message and didnt reply.
What? he sent another message.
What do you want me to say? Go see a counsellor? Work on your marriage? What? I typed
back.
Nothing. I am telling you facts from my side. All I want is for you to admit to some of your
feelings.
Why? Why do you want to know my feelings? I replied.
Because even though this is totally wrong, the fact is I love you. Goodnight, Neel replied.
We didnt talk in Seoul. We made love. We made crazy, crazy love. And we did the same when we
went on other business trips, ten more times in the next three months. Each time our intimacy felt
deeper than before. Despite feeling immoral, there was also the matter of my lonelinesshe made me
feel less lonely. I wanted Neel in my life. Someone to treat me like I was special and make me feel
loved, every bit of me. Maybe I gave him something too. A bit of the youth he wanted to hold on to.
The lightness and brightness of me.
As our business trips increased, our guilt trips decreased. He said he and Kusum disagreed on
many things, from raising kids to how hard he should work. He said I accepted him the way he was.
With every night we spent, flight we shared and meal we had together, I felt closer to him. I still
showed some restraint. He told me I love you every time we met. I never did. He never pushed me
to reciprocate either.
The Greenwood quest for more distressed hotels in Korea dragged on. They wanted to see
more options. We didnt mind. It meant more trips to Seoul, more companies to look at and more Neel
to hold through the night.

Three months later
ho is it? I said. I walked up to answer the doorbell in my nightclothes. I was watching the
Filmfare Awards at my home in Hong Kong. The film Queen, about a woman who took charge of her
life, was sweeping all the awards. The doorbell rang again.
I opened the door.
Neel? I said. I checked the time: 11 p.m.
Sorry, I didnt mean to disturb you, he said.
Neel and I had some unspoken rules. He never came to my apartment. I had never gone to his
house either. We had never got together in Hong Kong. Somehow, intimacy on a business trip far away
felt less sinful than in the city we lived in.
Whats the matter? I said.
Can I stay here tonight? Neel said.
Why? I said. I mean, we dont really do that.
Kusum and I had a fight, he said.
Anything major?
Things escalated. I didnt want them to get worse. I told her I had to go on a business trip and
left. I thought I would go to a hotel in Hong Kong but. . . he said and looked at me.
But what? You thought, why pay for a room and be alone when you can get accommodation
and sex for free? I thought.
Yeah, of course. You can stay here. Come in, I said.
Thanks, he said.
Hungry? I said.
He shook his head. He held me by my shoulders. He kissed me. He smiled. I did not.
What am I to you, Neel? A stress ball? To come and play with when you are hassled?
No. Not at all, Radhika, he said. He sounded shocked.
So why are you here? Didnt we have this pact that we dont do anything in Hong Kong?
Did we? I mean, whats the difference?
There is, to me. Business trips feel less. . .wrong. Theres also a clear boundary. This is. . .I
dont know what.
Why?
Because I dont know when you will show up here and when you wont. Today you are at my
home because you had a tiff with your wife. Tomorrow she will bake cookies for you and you will be
home with her. What does that make me? Ms Standby?
He pushed back his hair with an unsteady hand. I just wanted to be out of there. Fresh air. . .I
thought I will come and check if you wanted to be with me. I am sorry if. . .
Its fine tonight. I just prefer it outside Hong Kong. Helps me keep my sanity, I said.
Are you okay, Radhika? Ive never seen you like this, Neel said.
Lets go to bed.
We lay in bed. I turned off the lights. He put his arm around me. I didnt reciprocate and lay still.
I know what you are thinking, he said.
What?
That this is a booty call.
Now that you say it, maybe yes. Maybe thats why you are here.
I just wanted to be with you. Lets not do anything tonight. Let me just hold you, he said.
I looked at him. Even in the darkness I could see his eyes.
Really? I said.
Yeah. Why are you so surprised?
You are a guy. We are having an affair. You are okay with not having sex?
Of course, Neel said. He kissed my shoulder.
We can if you want to, I said.
No, not tonight. I just want to be with you, Neel said. Goodnight. I love you.
Goodnight, I said, in mild shock.
I stayed awake as he slept in my arms. He was two decades older, yet I felt I had a baby next
to me. He looked peaceful as his head lay on top of my hair. Maybe he did care for me. Maybe what
we were doing was wrong, but maybe something good could come out of it.
I checked. He seemed to be in deep sleep.
I love you, Neel Gupta, I whispered to his sleeping face.
I heard that, he said and turned sides.
You are so bad, I said and punched his shoulder as he grinned, eyes still closed.
I will let Josh do the talking. He is your supervisor. Only fair he gives you your number on bonus
day, Neel said.
Josh sat in Neels office. I took a seat with them.
Sure, I said. It was impressive how professional Neel and I were at work.
Josh gave me a summary of my performance review. My peers had rated me four-and-a-half
overall.
Thats a good rating, Neel said. I wondered what he himself had rated me.
Thanks, I said.
And the bottom line, Josh said. Your number, or your bonus for the year, is 350,000 dollars.
My heart skipped a beat.
Wow, I blurted out, even though I didnt intend to react.
Josh smiled.
That tells me you are happy. Good.
Thanks, I said, still absorbing my gross compensation. My total base salary and bonus came
up to half a million dollars.
Keep up the good work.
I am humbled, I said.
You deserve it. Your deals made a lot of money for the group, Neel said.
He smiled at me. I kept a straight face.
I came back to my desk. I called my mother. She gasped at the number, especially when I
converted it into rupees. My father went into shock.
Of course its all legal, dad. What are you saying? I promise its legal. Goldman Sachs is a
reputed firm, I said.
But three crores a year? he said.
Thats your little girl, I said.
He laughed.
You want to move to a new house in Gurgaon? One of those apartments with swimming pools
and gyms?
No, beta. We are fine here, dad said.
If you need anything, just anything, let me know, I said.
You visit us soon, he said.
I will, I said. Love you.
Josh finally left Neels office at 6, after finishing all bonus announcements.
I knocked at Neels door a little later.
Hey, come on in, he said.
Tired? I said.
Busy day, yes, he said.
I sat down in front of him.
Happy with your number? he said.
Yeah. I just wanted to be sure of one thing, I said.
What?
How much of this bonus is due to my work?
What? Neel said, surprised.
How much is due to my work and how much is due to what we have?
Are you kidding me, Radhika? This is all your good work. You know the profits on your
deals.
Yeah, you said I deserve it. I just want to be sure, I said.
He shook his head.
I dont believe it, he said.
What?
You are paid because you are good. Actually, you deserved more. However, there are limits
to what first-year VPs can be paid. I could have asked New York to override the limit, he said as I
interrupted him.
Please dont do things like that.
Well, I didnt. And its hurtful you think I would. I dont need to pay you more to get your
love. Okay?
Okay, I said. Thanks then.
Stop presuming things. I am trapped in a marriage. I dont have answers. I wish things were
different, he said, his voice agitated. He paused and continued in a calmer voice, But I love you.
That is why I am with you. I am proud of you. You deserve it. You deserve more.
I am sorry, I said.
Its fine, he said.
How was your bonus? I said.
I am not supposed to tell you that. He grinned.
You are also not supposed to do a lot of other things with me, mister, I said.
Three, he said.
Three what?
Three bucks.
Three million dollars? I said, my eyes round.
See, this is why I didnt want to tell you. It sounds like a lot, I know.
It is a lot. You made three fucking million dollars in bonus? I said.
Somehow, life has a way of making you feel inadequate about a 350,000-dollar bonus.
I told you. You deserve more. Dream bigger, girl. Neel winked at me.
You made so much money last year. You are a vice president. What else do you want career-wise?
Mom, its not just career. I am not ready.
I had surprised my parents. I had come home for the Chinese New Year four-day weekend in
Hong Kong. Aditi didi had also come over. Dad, Mom, Aditi didi and I visited India Gate. We took a
walk along the lawns. My mother walked with me. As always, she talked about her favourite topic.
You will never be fully ready. It is already hard to get a boy for you. You are too successful,
beta.
Is there such a thing? Too successful?
For girls there is. What to do?
Lets not start again, mom. I am only here for four days.
What is the use? At least chat with a few good ones? I will find NRIs, okay?
No, mom. I dont want to.
Do you have someone? mom said and looked at me. Her direct eye contact made me
uncomfortable.
I have someone, yes. Someone only five years younger than you, mom.
Not really.
Not really means?
No, I dont.
So? Dont you need a man? Every woman does.
I dont think so. I do fine on my own.
There is an age, beta. You get the best matches then. After that, a girls appeal declines. You
are twenty-six already.
So I am like a car model? Depreciating over the years.
You are impossible! I am not talking to you.
My mother sulked for the next half-hour, which meant thirty minutes of peace. We walked
along Rajpath all the way to Rashtrapati Bhavan. Her tough and sullen expression matched that of the
security guards on duty.
What do you want, mom? I said finally.
You say you are not ready. But give me a time-frame. When will you start looking at boys
seriously?
I dont know. Three years. Four?
You will be thirty. How do you expect me to find a good guy for you?
I will also be an even more successful banker.
So? That makes it worse.
I rolled my eyes.
I would have a lot of money of my own. That will help me and my husband get a good start in
life, no? I said.
You dont need to make so much. Your man will.
Mom. Please.
One year. I will wait one year, then you cooperate. We start looking seriously, okay?
Just one year?
I stopped to buy peanuts from a street vendor. She rambled on while I fed her with one hand
and held the peanuts in the other.
You are so fussy. It will take another year even after I start looking for you. Another year to
do the wedding, as NRIs have their own time issues. It is still a three-year process. You will be
twenty-nine. Already late. Doesnt listen, this girl. . .
One year. Okay? But dont push, I said.
I never push. Do I ever push? she said.
I looked at her. She seemed so earnest while asking her question, I burst out laughing.
Please find sensible men. Men with some class, okay? I said.
What class? I am going to find some slum-dweller for you or what? Ill find total gentleman,
you wait and see, she said. I mentally grinned at the word gentleman, which made me think of Neel.
He was what my mother would call a gentleman. Minus his affair, of course.
I love you, mom. You are too cute, I said.
What? And what is this class business when you yourself are eating peanuts on the road?
N

Dragon-I restaurant, Central, Hong Kong
eel and I had come for dim sum, the traditional Chinese dumplings, at the posh Dragon-I, a
modern Chinese restaurant near our office. I struggled with my chopsticks as I picked up a
steamed spinach dumpling.
So yeah, one year. Thats all mom gave me, I said. I finished recounting my India Gate
conversation.
Neel lifted a peanut dumpling with his chopsticks easily.
So you are getting married? Neel said.
I looked at him and thought a little before I spoke again. I am just tired of my mothers
relentless pursuit. I have to listen to her at some point.
What about us, what we have? Neel took a sip of Chinese tea.
Neel, what about my life? Do you care? I said, my voice firm. We locked eyes.
Of course, I care. But isnt us important? he said in a reasonable voice.
For there to be an us, there has to be a future. Us has no future, right? I said.
I dont know. We havent discussed anything, Neel said, looking taken aback by how serious
the lunch conversation had turned.
And whose fault is that? I said.
Of course, it is your fault, Neel, is what I wanted to say.
The topic never came up, I guess, he said.
I didnt respond. I just stared at him. I put my chopsticks down.
What? he said, figuring out that something was very wrong.
What topic, Neel? I said.
Us, he said. Us and our future.
Us is useless, I said.
Us is special, Neel said.
Well, all this us has done is have an affair for the last year. This us pretends to be colleagues
in the office. Whereas in reality this us sleeps with each other during business trips and, now, even at
my place.
Can you keep your voice down, please? Neel whispered.
It only pissed me off.
See. Even here, even at Dragon-I, we are colleagues. I cant say anything that will give us
away. I cant hold your hand here, can I? Even though you do like to spoon me at night, isnt it?
Neel looked around. The closest customers were three tables away.
You want to talk, we can talk. About anything. I had no idea you had so much bottled up.
How could you? You have it easy. Partner at office. Husband and father at home. Young chick
when you want her. What do you have to worry about?
This.
What?
That you are not okay about it. When I thought you were.
What made you think I am okay?
I dont know. When we make love, or when we work together, or when we chat, isnt it out of
this world?
Life isnt lived out of this world, Neel. Life is lived in this world.
To be fair, even I didnt know why I felt so anxious. Perhaps my mothers one-year tickingclock
deadline had triggered a panic attack.
You know the problem, Neel. I cant even discuss us with anyone. Other girls discuss their
boyfriends with their friends. I cant, right?
I had to stop talking. I excused myself to go to the washroom. I returned after washing my face.
Neel looked at me with concern.
Sorry, I said. Why am I saying sorry to him?
You dont have to be sorry. Its your feelings. Thank you for sharing them. I am sorry for not
sensing them earlier.
My plate of vegetable dumplings had gone cold. One of the waiters replaced it. Neel and I ate
in silence.
I love you, Neel said.
I shrugged.
So? I said. Kind of irrelevant, isnt it?
What do you want, Radhika? Neel said.
I kept silent.
A future? I am twenty years older, he said.
You said age doesnt matter in love. Didnt you?
I am married. I have kids. So much baggage.
Exactly. So what am I doing with you?
Arent you happy with just what we have? Neel said. He seemed to be genuinely confused.
Would you be? If you were in my place? I asked, looking him squarely in the eye.
We have our work. We have love. We have excitement. We have friendship. We dont have
the predictability and monotony of a married couple.
You make marriage sound so bad. You are married. The whole world gets married.
Clarify this for me. Do you want to get married? Or are you feeling stressed only because
your mother wants you to get married soon?
Eventually I do want to, Neel. How could you think I wont? I want marriage, kids, family.
Really?
What do you mean, really? I do. I want Sunday IKEA trips with my husband and a whole
bunch of kids. I want to wipe my kids messy faces when I feed them. I want to bake cookies for them.
Yes, yes I do.
Really, Radhika? Neel said. He looked at me gobsmacked, as if I had revealed my secret
desire to join the ISIS.
Yeah. Why?
I thought you were career-minded.
Excuse me? What is that supposed to mean? I said, my voice ice-cold.
Nothing. Lets talk later. Ill ask for the bill, Neel said and signalled the waiter.
No, Neel. Not tonight, I said.
We were lying tangled up in my bed. He nuzzled the side of my neck. It signalled that he
wanted sex. I shrugged my shoulder, dislodging his lips.
Radhika, come here, he murmured my name in a persuasive voice.
No, Neel, I said. I am tired.
He had come to my apartment four nights in a row this week. I dont know what story he made
up at home. Frankly, I didnt care. Every night I let him in. We watched TV for a while and we went
to bed.
He rebuttoned the shirt of his nightsuit.
This is the fourth time you have rejected me, he said. He was right. We hadnt had sex all
week.
Stop assuming. I am not rejecting anything. I am tired, I said.
Is it your mother? he said.
I shook my head.
Is it me? he said.
I shook my head.
Its me, I said.
What?
How could I let myself get into this? I said.
We love each other, Radhika. Stop making it sound so bad.
I switched on the night lamp next to me and turned on my side to face him. I lifted myself up to
rest on my elbow.
Really, Neel? I said.
What? Neel said.
I allowed myself to get involved with a married man. Not just a one-night stand. A long and
full-blown affair. Hell, I allowed myself to fall in love with you. When there is no future.
I have no plans to leave you.
But do you have any plans to change anything?
Why do we have to change? What we have is perfect.
What if Kusum finds out?
She wont.
What if she does?
Dont be paranoid. You are being over-anxious these days. Is it that time of the month?
He tried to put his arms around me.
Shut up, Neel, I said, extracting myself from his grip. Dont trivialize it.
Your weekend trip to Delhi and talking to your mother has really shaken you up.
Maybe I needed to be shaken up. To really think about what I want.
Neel sat up in bed.
Sorry to say this, but you arent thinking clearly. If I go by what you said in Dragon-I, Neel
said.
I said I want to have a family. Have kids. Be a good mother and look after them well. Thats
not thinking clearly?
You are a star at work. What is all this mundane stuff you are talking about? Any woman can
do all this.
But I cant?
I didnt say that.
So?
I see you as someone exceptional. And special. You could be an MD, a partner.
Yeah, I will be. I like my work too.
But you said you want marriage, IKEA, bunch of kids. Baking cookies, really?
Yes, I want all that too.
Radhika, you are getting carried away. You saw Kusum the other day and you are getting
competitive over me.
I too sat up in bed, almost panting in anger.
Its not always about you, Mr Neel Gupta. I am talking about myself. My needs. Do you get it,
Mr I-am-so-smart Goldman Sachs partner?
Its just that. . . He turned silent.
What? I said. He did not respond.
Say what you wanted to say, Neel.
Its just I never thought of you as the maternal type. I dont know if you were even meant to be
a mother.
I felt my face turn hot. My whole body began to quiver. Neel figured he had said something
really, really wrong.
Okay, that did not come out right.
Get out, I said, my voice calm.
He didnt move.
Please leave my apartment, Neel. Get out now.
Come here, I will make you feel better, he said, leaning forward. He tried to kiss me.
Slap! I gave him a tight one across his face. I didnt care who the fuck he was.
How dare you? How dare you fucking say that? I said.
I am sorry.
Just leave. Or I will send an email to all of Goldman Sachs tomorrow. About us. Would you
like that?
He slithered out of bed. I kept a stern gaze on him as he dressed, picked up his laptop bag and
left.
I curled up in bed, tears rolling down my cheeks. I cried and cried. I buried my face in the
pillows, including the one that smelt of Neel, and just cried.
You are so stupid, Radhika, I said to myself.
What was I thinking anyway? Neel and I would walk off into the sunset? He thinks I wasnt
meant to be a mother. How could I ever love this man? Did I not know this day would come?
My stomach hurt. When I went to the bathroom I discovered that Neel was right. It was that
time of the month. In the middle of all this drama I had to deal with the first day of my period. Did I
tell you it sucks to be a girl sometimes?
Whats this? Neel said, surprised.
He slid the letter on his desk towards me.
Josh Ang,
Distressed Debt Group
Goldman Sachs
Dear Josh,
I would like to submit my resignation from the position of vice president in the
Distressed Debt Group.
Thank you so much for the wonderful experience.
Radhika Mehta
That reached you real quick, I quipped.
Of course. I have to sign off on it, Neel said.
Can you please do that, sir?
Will you stop it, please? Neel said, his voice low.
Fine. Whatever. Ill be quiet. I exhaled and kept quiet.
This is your career, Neel said after a few seconds.
I know what I am giving up. My career is the one thing I truly had as my own, I said.
So why?
I have no choice. My career is intertwined with you. If I have to leave you, both have to go.
So dont leave me.
And do what? Become your mistress?
What rubbish.
What else am I? Mistresses at least get some rights and privileges. I am worse, actually.
You are no mistress. You make your own money. Mistresses take money from the man. They
are dependent. You do it out of choice.
Which in some ways makes it even worse. Can we hurry up, please?
You wont let go, is it? Neel said.
I have decided, Neel. As you can see, I have nothing to lose. You do. So please.
I am sorry about what I said yesterday, okay? That mother thing.
Its not just what you said or didnt say. This whole thing is wrong. And now if I have any
self-respect left, I need to end it.
Neel looked at me carefully. I kept my eyes on the view outside the windowthe Hong Kong
harbour.
You make me feel so bloody guilty, he said.
You should feel bloody guilty, I said, still without looking at him.
We did this together. Nobody forced you.
I know. I feel guilty. So about time you do too.
Give me two hours.
What? I said, turning to him.
Come back in two hours. Can you?
I shrugged and left his office. I went back to my cubicle.
My desk phone rang after two hours. I went back to Neels office.
Leave me if you have to. Dont quit the firm, Neel said.
So are you resigning instead? I said.
Can you stop being so harsh? We have happy memories.
I smirked at him. He continued, You can take a transfer to another office. New York. London.
Wherever.
I looked at him.
I suppose not New York, he said.
Sure, not New York. I had a relationship wreck in that city too.
I. . . I began to speak as he interrupted me.
You can get jobs outside. But please dont leave the group. We value you. I will never forgive
myself.
Is that all you wont forgive yourself for? I said.
He hung his head low. Then he stood up and went to the window. I thought about his proposal
for a minute.
Fine, I can move to London. But it has to feel like a new job. I dont want you in my life. At
all.
What do you mean?
No common deals. No being in touch. Be gone. Clear?
How can we. . .
Neel, I am serious. If this is reported, you get into trouble. Not me. You are the boss.
Are you threatening me?
I am saying I am serious. I am going to be a huge mess. I dont know if I will be able to pick
up the pieces again. I dont want you in my life there. That is why I am leaving.
Okay, Neel said in a heavy voice and came back to his seat.
Thanks.
Someone from the London office will call you this evening, he said.
Fine. Can I leave now?
Yeah, he said and paused. Radhika?
Yes?
I am sorry.
For?
I am sorry I let you down.
I stood up to leave.
I let myself down, Neel.
I
32
felt a lump in my throat as I replayed Hong Kong in my head. My hand holding the breakfast plate
trembled. Neel looked at me. My relatives continued to fill the dining room. I drank a glass of
water to buy time.
Can we talk in private? Please? Neel whispered.
How, Neel? Cant you see? I am at my wedding.
I have a room here. Come for a little bit. Please.
How did you get a room? They told us they were full.
Its not important. Please, fifteen minutes?
But how did you get a room? I said. I wanted to scream at the lobby manager.
I took the presidential suite. Thats all they had. Now can you come there? Room 101?
Of course, Mr Partner had to be in the presidential suite. My cousins waved, gesturing me to
come back.
I need to have breakfast with my cousins. See you in thirty minutes, I said.
You said you would leave me alone, I said as he opened the door. I entered his lavish 3,000-squarefeet
presidential suite. I sat on one of the sofas in the suite living room. He didnt respond. He went to
the electric kettle at the corner of the room and filled it with water.
Tea? he said.
Neel! I dont have time. You said you wouldnt bother me.
I cut off for a year. Did I ever bother you in London? he said. Would you like some green
tea?
What is it you wanted to tell me? I said.
Can you relax? Neel said. How about a Hey, how have you been?
Neel, I said. I dont have time for pleasantries.
I am just making conversation. Am I allowed to do that while I make a cup of tea?
Sure, I said.
We havent caught up in a year. How was London? You know I grew up there, right?
I do.
So how was it?
I just kept looking at him.
What?
I am not here to talk about London.
Give me a minute. I need to bring something from the other room.
I nodded. He went into the bedroom. I looked out of the window. The sea was silent behind
the double-glazed glass. Neels mention of London brought back many memories of my move there.
London
One Year Ago
T
33
he Goldman Sachs office in London is located on 133 Fleet Street. The office at Peterborough
Court is at the same site as the old Daily Telegraph building. Patricia, the group secretary,
settled me into my new cubicle. The British accent in the London office reminded me of Neel. When
you break up, it becomes a habit to remember everything about the manwith my second heartbreak I
had learnt this much. Neel was a habit, a bad habit rather, almost an addiction. Like smoking, when
you know it is bad for you but you cant seem to leave it. I also learnt that you dont get better at
handling heartbreaks. They suck every single time, even though this time was marginally better since I
had initiated the break-up. I battled the urge to email him, telling him I had arrived at the new place.
Why couldnt he email me? Why couldnt he call? Well, how could he? I had threatened to
expose him.
I missed his voice. I missed his eyes. I missed his touch. I missed all that he did to me, with
me, in bed. So what if he is married? He loves me, and love is what I need, right?
See, this is how your mind plays games with you. If it wants you to do something, it will find a
hundred reasons to justify it. Whats more, the reasons will even make sense. I picked up the internal
phone on my desk to call Neel.
The buzz on my cellphone disrupted my thoughts. In the past few months my mother had
discovered WhatsApp. She had sent me a message.
Checked profile?
You wont give up, will you? I wanted to type back.
Doing it, now, I replied instead.
I opened shaadi.com on my office laptop. The screen displayed happy faces of couples in
nuptial bliss, who had found each other on this website. Testimonials spoke of how a couple who met
on the site married within three months and were now expecting a child. Was finding love that
simple? Why did I find it difficult? Why did I have to complicate everything? Or was there something
wrong with me?
I logged on to the account my mother had set up. The page opened to a summary of my profile.
She had used a picture of mine from India Gate, the one I took when I visited Delhi last time. A
shadow fell on my face in the photo. My eyes were half-closed. She could not have chosen a worse
picture.
I read my profile.
Hi, I am a young, slim, quite fair, Punjabi Khatri girl aged 26, 54 tall. I am currently
working in London, but flexible to move anywhere with my husband. I am familyminded
and dont mind staying in a joint family.
I reached for my cellphoneto call my mother and blast her. I resisted the urge and read on.
I can cook North Indian cuisine quite well. I have one elder sister who is already
married and well-settled in Delhi. My parents have no other liabilities. My father
retired from a respected position in State Bank of India and my mother is a housewife.
We are well off and can do a high-status wedding.
My eyebrows shot up. I read the next section.
I am looking for a well-qualified, well-settled suitable match from a good Punjabi
family. Someone who will look after my family and me and respect elders. If interested
please respond with details about you, including horoscope or date and time of birth.
Regards, Radhika Mehta.
Seriously? Mom, seriously? I said out loud. I closed the shaadi.com window. I had to call mom and
talk, or rather shout at her. I couldnt do that in the office. I packed my laptop in my Tumi bag and
stood up.
I am going to get lunch, I told Patricia and left the office.
I went out on Fleet Street and found Itsu, a Japanese-inspired healthy fast-food chain. I
ordered a vegetables and brown rice potsu pot and sat down to eat. Fork in one hand and phone in the
other, I called my dear mother. I charged at her as soon as she answered.
Mom, what are you doing?
What? she said, surprised.
I loaded my profile on my laptop screen.
I saw the profile.
Liked it?
How do you even begin to answer that?
Mom, are you serious? What is this?
Why? I wrote what will get you the best response. Sharma aunty next door helped me.
Its horrible, mom. Really, who is this person you have written about? It is not me.
What are you are saying? It is you 100 per cent. Isnt your height five feet four inches?
Mom, first of all, the picture is terrible.
Its what I had. Send me a better one. We should have done a portfolio when you had come
here.
I will send you one from here.
Send one in Indian clothes.
Why?
Are you stupid? Are you going to send me a picture in your office suit? Are you applying for
a job?
Its who I am.
Stop it, Radhika. Is the picture the only problem?
There are a million problems. Let me start. What is quite fair? Tell them my real
complexion. Say I am wheatish or whatever.
If you write wheatish people think it is dark. You have to write quite fair. Raise it up a
notch.
Oh, really? So what if someone writes dark then?
If someone says dark, its like black. You know those Negro-type Africans.
Mom, thats not a good term. No one says Negro.
Whatever. These are minor things.
Ill tell you huge things.
Say.
One, you say flexible to move with husband. Who said that? It depends, right? Maybe he
has to move. Its a discussion. Two, I dont mind joint family? Why do we have to put that? Three,
my parents have no other liabilities. What is that? Oh, and dont miss, we can do a high-status
wedding, that is four. Five, why just Punjabi family? Six, I dont need a guy to look after me.
Seven, send horoscope. Mom, really, I dont know what to say, I said.
I had to pause just to breathe. The customer at the next table offered me a glass of water. I
mouthed him a thanks and took a sip.
You have said a lot, mom said, in her upset voice. No respect left for parents, I see.
I am not disrespecting you. This whole thing is just wrong, mom. I dont want to be a part of
this.
I dont think you understand the strategy.
Strategy?
Yeah. You dont scare away the good guys.
Why would they get scared?
If they see a girl who is too independent-minded, too qualified, doing too well, they get
scared.
What nonsense.
Its a fact. I didnt make the rules, beta.
Oh and one more thing, I said. You barely mention my job. Currently working in London,
really? I am a vice president in Goldman Sachs. I make half a million dollars a year.
Exactly. Now you see the strategy?
Huh?
See how we mention it also but hide the achievements also?
Mom, can you hear yourself? You are hiding your childs achievements?
I am hiding my daughters achievements. So we get more boys to choose from. Thats all. I
am not taking away your achievements.
So if I were a son?
Obviously, we would put your salary first. But now we have to be careful.
I smacked my forehead. How do I get through to her? I wondered if I had made the biggest
mistake of my life. Maybe Neel was right. I was not meant for all this nonsense. I missed Neel. I
wanted to call him so bad.
Are you there? my mother said.
Yeah, I said. My heart ached as I thought of Neel holding me at night.
I am coming there, my mother said.
Where?
London. I am going to spend some time with you. We will do this together.
Enough, mom, I said. She tossed another parantha on my plate.
I didnt want a husband. I needed my mother with me in London. So she could cook me hot
gobhi paranthas every Saturday morning for breakfast.
Why do you stay in Chelsea? Southall has so many Indians. Better, no? she said.
Have you seen the park view outside? See how charming this is, I said.
But do you get achaar and chutney? In Southall you get it. Sharma aunty told me.
You get it here too, I said. I tore open the second parantha. Just stay with me. Forever, I
said.
See, even you miss having a proper home. Is this even a life? Go to office early. Come back
late to an empty house.
Mom, I have one of the most wanted jobs in the world.
And I have one of the most unwanted jobs, but I love it. Taking care of my family, my mother
said and gave me a glass of lassi. She kissed me on the forehead. I hugged her.
I love you, mom.
I love you too. Now show me the responses. You have made me wait all week.
I had modified my profile on the matrimonial website. I had removed obnoxious bits like
husband to take care of me and no liabilities. And added: successful career at one of the worlds
top investment banks. I also mentioned I wanted a secure and easygoing man.
Fine, I said. I opened my laptop and logged in.
Fifty responses, very good, she said excitedly. Open them.
Opening, mom. Be patient.
The first query came from a Mohit Ahuja, from a business family in Delhi. They owned three
restaurants, Mohit managed one of them.
No, I said.
Why? my mother said. They look well-off.
I dont want to be with someone who runs a family restaurant.
What nonsense!
Mom, see the qualifications. BA from some random university. No. Next.
We continued scanning the responses for the next few hours.
This one is ugly. I cant wake up next to a man like that, I reacted to one.
Mom came up with one of her wise sayings: There is no such thing as an ugly man.
Just to get back at her I rejected some men due to their looks. Others didnt make it because
they had jobs in India where they earned a few lakhs a year. Despite all my feminist leanings, I didnt
want to be with someone who made so much less than me. Why does a woman feel a mans income is
more important than hers? Maybe because it is important to men, and very few men are secure
enough to just let this issue be.
No, mom. He lives in Bulandshahr. Joint family. Family business. No, no, no, I said as my
mother showed me another candidate.
I was realizing by now that sifting through prospective grooms was harder than valuing
distressed assets.
You are not doing this properly, my mother said as I rejected a guy because I didnt like his
printed Hawaiian shirt.
But I hate that shirt. How could he wear it? I laughed.
He is a doctor. We are shortlisting him. You can choose his clothes after marriage, mom said.
We finished at 4 in the afternoon, with a shortlist of ten potential grooms to be contacted
further.
Im tired. You want to step out for a coffee? I said.
Sure, she said.
We walked to a Pret a Manger café near Earls Court tube station. My mother held my hand.
We have done something together after a long time, she said.
Yeah, bonding over shortlisted grooms, I said and laughed.
You wait and see. I will find a prince for you, she said.
H
34
i, can you see me? I said. I sat at my dining table, facing my laptop.
I had a Skype call fixed with Raj Bakshi, a doctor based in Boston, USA.
Yeah. Its a little dark though. Can you switch on another light? Raj said. He was thirty years
old, had a thin moustache and wore a light blue shirt.
Before I could respond, my mother switched on all the lights in the apartment.
Mom? What are you doing here? I whispered to her.
Yeah, much better, Raj said.
One sec, Raj, I said and muted him. I bent the laptop screen to cover the camera.
What happened? Dont keep him waiting. Talk, mom said.
Mom, if we are doing this, we are doing this my way.
I am only trying to help. . .
Thanks. But let me talk to them without you hovering around.
My mother made a face and left the room. I resumed the Skype call.
Hi, I said.
Hello. Must be quite late there?
Its midnight, yes. London is five hours ahead.
Sorry. I just came back from work, he said.
You are a doctor, right?
Yeah. And what exactly do you do? Your profile said banking.
I am in Goldman Sachs. VP in the Distressed Debt Group.
Oh, he said and became quiet.
So yeah, I said, wondering what to say next. I dont know why I take responsibility for
awkward silences.
What kind of doctor are you? I said.
I am a GP, general practitioner, in the Boston City Hospital. Doing my residency.
I could never be a doctor. All that blood. I feel faint in hospitals, I said and smiled.
Its a part of life, he said, his tone sombre. People are dying. Someone needs to save them.
Ah. Yes. Of course, I said. Okay, isnt Dr Bakshi a little too serious?
Hows Goldman Sachs? he said.
Good. Hectic. But I like it.
They pay people very well, I hear.
Its based on performance, but yes. Its good money.
If you dont mind, how much do you make? he said.
Isnt this too much too soon? Whats the protocol? He can ask me all these things in the
first call? Can I ask him too?
Are we sharing compensation already? I smiled, to lighten his operation-theatre mood.
Sure. Why keep it hidden? I make 100,000 a year. Plus benefits, he said.
What am I supposed to do? Clap?
Okay, I said.
And you? he said.
I dont know why I didnt feel like telling him. Perhaps I was getting tuned into male pride. I
could sense which guy could take it and who could not.
We can discuss all this later. So what do you want to specialize in? Or do you want to
specialize at all?
I want to be an ophthalmologist. Eye doctor.
I know. Good, I said.
I had a sinking feeling this wasnt going to work. How do you end calls like this?
So how much is your salary again? he said.
Okay, he asked for it. Thrice.
If you must know, I made half a million dollars last year.
I heard his chair creak in response.
Five hundred thousand dollars? he said.
Yeah. Thats what half a million is, I said. I kicked myself for that patronizing comment. It
wasnt funny. I had a feeling nothing was funny to Dr Stuck-up Bakshi anyway.
Okay, he said.
Okay? What the fuck is a singular okay? They should ban this one-word reply in
conversations. How am I supposed to take it forward from here?
So yeah. What else do you do apart from work? I said.
Excuse me. But I have to go.
Oh really? What happened? I said. I hate being rejected. Even by boring men doing their
residency in Boston.
Nothing. . . Okay, I will tell you. This is not going to work. Your salary is too high.
How can you get too high a salary?
I mean for me. I mean compared to me.
I realized this was a dead end. Why not end it with a bit of fun?
Oh, so you mean you are not man enough to handle it? I said.
He hung up without saying bye. Oops, strike one I guess. Ha ha.
Three weeks later we had struck off all the ten shortlisted names from the list.
Its not going to work, mom, I said.
We had come to Dishoom, a quirky modern-Indian café in Covent Garden.
We ordered pao bhaji and masala chai, a rare delicacy in London.
I told you not to mention your career too much, she said, upset that I had rejected all ten
suitors.
I cant hide who I am, I said.
Why cant you be like your sister?
Because I am not Aditi didi. I dont want to be her.
We came back home. She came up with another idea. She wanted to upgrade our shaadi.com
membership to the VIP category, where special agents help you get grooms.
We have special needs. We need special help, she said.
I guess I was special. Specially fucked up. No wonder she needed an army of specialists to
trap a man for me.
She sat on my bed. I lay next to her and turned the other way.
Do whatever you want, mom, I said.
One of my daughters got settled so easily. I just hope and pray God helps us, she muttered to
herself and raised her folded hands to the sky.
Whats with invoking God? Am I some illness? A misfortune? I said, without looking at her.
Will you stop being so touchy? It is a fact Aditis marriage happened so quickly. She has
whiter skin, which helps. But she also had a good attitude. You should have an even better attitude.
I turned towards her and interrupted her.
What do you mean, even better attitude? I should be more subservient? What is that word in
ads? Homely? It just means submissive, right? You want me to be more homely?
Well. Yeah.
I am not homely. So maybe I will just stay single.
Dont say such horrible things.
Theres nothing horrible about it, I said.
This money and international job have gone to your head. You are not even a girl anymore.
What? I said, one eyebrow up in disgust.
Forget it.
Mom, dad used to walk me to the school bus stop, remember? When I was in primary
school. She looked at me, said nothing.
He used to tell me, Beta, when you grow up, you can do whatever you want. The sky is the
limit for you.
So?
Why do people tell girls all this? You ask them to achieve things, but when they do, you cant
handle it. Why does it become you are not even a girl anymore?
I dont know all that. I never worked. I didnt have choices like yours, she said.
Neither did you have the courage, I said.
She paused for a second before she spoke again. I dont know. Okay, fine, I dont have
courage. Anyway, I think it is better for women if they dont work.
Mom! I screamed in exasperation.
What?
My job means a lot to me. Can you not demean it?
Can you not demean me? my mother said. She broke into tears. Her sobs turned into a fullblown
crying fest, as she mourned the loss of her ten shortlisted prospective sons-in-law.
I looked around. I found a tissue box on the bedside table. I passed it to her. She wiped her
tears.
Do you know how much pain I had to bear when you were born? she said.
Its called labour, mom. I didnt cause it, it is how kids happen.
I heard you wanted to abort me, I said.
She looked up.
Who told you?
Its not important how I found out. I heard the doctor goofed up on the sex determination test.
He said it would be a boy.
My mother looked at me in silence.
Those were different times, she whispered. We had Aditi. Your dadi wanted a boy.
You did too.
Yeah.
Sorry, mom, I came out. You got a raw deal.
Dont be stupid. I love you.
She hugged me and after a moment I hugged her back.
Then let me be, I said, please. Groom or no groom, doesnt matter. I want you to support
me.
A tear escaped my eye. I buried my face in moms chest.
Dont worry. We will go through some more profiles tomorrow. Your rajkumar will be there
somewhere, said mom.

Three weeks later
y mother wore her reading glasses. She flicked through the pictures on the shaadi.com app on
my phone.
See this. Why havent you accepted this one? my mother said.
We sat in my living room at noon on a Saturday morning, I in blue pajamaswhite T-shirt and
she in a salwar-kameez.
Read it out, mom, I said, typing on my laptop. What does he do?
He works in Facebook, she said, and removed her glasses, surprised. How can you work in
Facebook? He does Facebook all day?
No, mom. Facebook is a company. Go on. How old?
Twenty-eight. Height five feet ten inches. I will read his profile?
Sure. He wrote it? I said.
No, it says written by parent.
Thats two points down.
Stop it. Even I had to write it the first time for you, right?
I will never forget that. Anyway, go on.
My mother read from the phone screen.
Our son is an intelligent, humble and simple boy who is looking for a suitable life
partner. He prefers a career woman, someone who is willing to live in the USA. He is
a systems engineer at Facebook, where he has worked for the last five years. He is
based in Menlo Park, San Francisco. He did his engineering in Computer Science from
NIT Nagpur, where he topped his class. He did his masters from MIT in Boston, USA.
He is our only child. We are a simple Punjabi family based in Mumbai (originally from
West Delhi). We want the right girl above anything else, as she will be our new family
member.
My mother finished reading and reached for a glass of water.
Not bad, well-written. Open-minded and honest. Salary? I said and pressed save on my
laptop.
It says between 150,000 to 175,000 USD, plus stock options. Is that good?
Good. Give me the phone.
I saw his profile picture. A lean, tall and bespectacled man in a beige overcoat stood against
the backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. He resembled Sundar Pichai, the CEO of
Google. Geeks have their own role models, I guess.
He is handsome, my mother said.
He looks like the student who tells other children to stop talking.
Any nonsense you say.
I read his name. Brijesh Gulati.
Ugh, I said. Ugh. Rejected. I am not marrying someone called Brijesh Gulati.
Why? Its a nice name. Gulatis are Punjabis. Dont you know that restaurant on Pandara
Road?
Exactly. I am not marrying someone whose name resembles a Punjabi restaurant.
My mother stared at me.
What? I said.
What name you want? Amitabh Bachchan? Akshay Kumar?
Its not that. It is just that hes just so. . . I thought of the right word, typical.
I think you are looking for negatives. And you cant find any. So all this name and typical
nonsense. Tell me one proper thing wrong? my mother said.
Exactly. Theres nothing wrong with him. But he doesnt have like, any wow or thrill factor.
You are choosing a husband. Not taking an amusement park ride for thrills.
Ah, but love can be thrilling, mom, I wanted to say. Love can mean passion under the
moonlight on remote islands. The thought of that night with Neel made me flinch.
Okay fine, I said in a brisk fashion and chose the accept option. I put my phone aside. Ten
minutes later my phone made a ting sound. I picked it up.
I dont believe this. He already sent a Hi with his Skype details. Mom, this is desperate,
no?
This is a good sign. It means God wants both of you to connect, my mother said. It is amazing
how mothers can justify any action as divine intervention as long as it suits them.
Set up a call, my mother said in her most royal tone.
I typed back a message.
Skype call fixed for tomorrow, I said to my mother.
Hi, I said, as cheerfully as possible. One of the most awkward moments in world history has to be
speaking to a shortlisted arranged marriage candidate for the first time. I sat in my living room near
my window, on Skype with Brijesh.
Good morning, Brijesh said. Or sorry. Good afternoon.
So I am Radhika. You already saw my profile.
Yes, I found it quite interesting.
Really? Which part? I said, to enable more conversation.
I like that you have a good career. Investment banking is hectic, though, isnt it?
It is. But I am used to it now.
I am sure. And what are your interests? he said.
I love to travel. I like music. I like exploring whichever city I live in. How about you?
I mostly work. But I like watching cricket and Bollywood movies.
Really? An Indian software guy who likes watching cricket and Hindi movies? Can it be
more stereotypical?
It seemed Brijesh had read my mind.
Yeah, so typical, right? Cricket and Bollywood. I am kind of boring.
For the first time a guy had admitted a weakness to me on a Skype call. He was kind of boring.
But unlike super-bores who didnt even know they were bores, at least he knew he was one.
I smiled.
If I go to sleep on this call then I am afraid you may be right, I said.
He laughed.
You have a good sense of humour, he said.
Thanks, I said.
Actually, I watch some English movies too. Have to develop a taste. You can suggest some
good ones to me.
Sure, I said.
He can praise a womans sense of humour and even take advice from hernot bad.
He continued to talk. I cant pretend to be fake-sophisticated. I grew up in Naraina Vihar in
West Delhi and then Borivali in Mumbai. So I didnt have much exposure. But now I want to learn
more about the world.
Wait a minute. Did you say you grew up in Naraina Vihar?
Yeah. Why? Its a small colony in West Delhi.
I am from Naraina too, I said, surprised. H block. Thats where my parents live.
What? I was in G block. G-478. My parents still have a house there. They live in Mumbai
now, of course.
My bedroom door opened. Mom came in.
Naraina? she whispered, her face unable to contain her excitement. She had probably had an
ear to the door and heard our entire conversation. I shooed her away. I spoke to Brijesh again. This
is uncanny. Did you shop from Modern Stores?
Yes. That fat uncle who never had change? he said and both of us laughed.
Anyway, so yes. I wanted someone who has Indian roots but is better exposed to the world
than I am. You have been in New York, Hong Kong and now London. I felt you could be an asset to
me.
I wanted to reject him. I wanted one solid reason to do so. I couldnt find it.
He talked about meeting up towards the end of the call.
I go for work to New York sometimes. Its midway between London and San Francisco. If our
calls go well, would it be possible for you to come?
Lets see, I said. Skype is good for now. Speak soon.
My mother entered the living room the second I disconnected the call.
You cant snoop on me, mom. This is not fair.
She came up to me and gave me a hug.
Sorry, my beta, she said and kissed my forehead. But what a great boy. And Naraina? See
how Sai Babas blessed us?

One month later
R
St Regis Hotels café, New York
adhika, right?
I heard his voice as I entered. I turned to look at him. He wore beige chinos and a black
turtleneck, perhaps his homage to Steve Jobs.
Brijesh? I said. We shook hands.
Yeah. Good to see you in person, he said, guiding me to a table.
The old-world luxury café had high ceilings and colonial-era furniture. A saxophone player
and a pianist played in one corner.
We ordered tea for two.
A waiter brought us tea on a tiered silver tray of goodiesscones, jam, clotted cream, cakes,
mini cucumber sandwiches and chocolates.
Afternoon tea was a great idea. Everything looks lovely, Brijesh said. He took a few
sandwiches and placed them on his plate.
Glad you like it, I said.
I wore office attire, a grey suit, partly because I had gone to the 85 Broad Street office earlier
to meet Jonathan and Craig. Mostly, I wore it because my mother had told me not to. She had
instructed me to wear a magenta salwar-kameez and dangling gold earrings. I told her I wouldnt go
to New York looking like I am a part of a Baisakhi celebrations troupe. In fact, I wanted to be as
drab and real as possible. Brijesh could see me as I was and reject me if he wanted to.
When is your flight back? Brijesh said.
9.30, I said. I have to leave for the airport at 7.30.
We had four-and-a-half hours to decide if we wanted to be together for the rest of our lives.
So who talks first? he said.
Usually I do, I said and smiled.
Oh. I would actually prefer that. Tell me about yourself.
I told him the story of my life from my childhood until now. I covered everything, apart from
Debu and Neel.
So I have been in London for six months. Parents now would like it if I could settle down.
Gosh, doesnt that sound so lame? I said, ending my story.
What? The term settle down? he said.
Yeah. Only in India do we use that phrase. Settle down, like in sedimentation everything
settles down. Dont move anymore. No risk, no excitement.
He laughed.
Our parents valued security over everything else. In their time jobs were few, so you better
grab one and settle down. Else you would be on the road, Brijesh said.
So true, I said.
Even I have settled down in a job, Brijesh said.
Really? You are with Facebook. Isnt it one of the most fun companies to work for?
See, thats the thing. Everyone thinks I am in this amazing company. How could I even think of
leaving it?
Do you like your job?
Work is challenging. Money is good.
So then?
Sometimes I wonder. . .there is so much happening in the tech world. Cant I start something
of my own?
Of course you can.
He looked happy at my encouragement. He told me some more about his life. He grew up in
Naraina for the first couple of years, after which his parents moved to Mumbai. His father worked in
Indian Oil. Brijesh wanted to get into IIT, but couldnt make it despite two tries. He said it was
because he was distracted. He joined NIT, topped the class and went to MIT for higher studies.
And then a typical IT job. Thats me, Brijesh said.
I smiled. We finished our tea. The waiter arrived with the bill.
It was 5.30; we had two more hours.
Lets take a walk in Central Park, I suggested.
We entered Central Park on 59th Street, with the Apple store on my right. The green trees and
grass around made us forget we were in one of the busiest cities of the world. I thought of Debu. His
office was less than a mile away.
You seem lost. Work? he said.
No, its just. . .New York brings back memories.
We walked in the direction of the Central Park Zoo.
Good memories or bad memories? Brijesh said.
Mixed, I said. Mostly good, though.
We reached the zoo and bought two tickets. We saw the highlight, a pair of baby grizzly bears,
born just six weeks ago.
They are so cute, I said, as the two cubs, no bigger than rabbits, slept on their mothers back.
You like kids? Brijesh said. My heart beat fast. The kids-and-mother question had made me
lose men in the past. Did he mean, do I like kids in general? Or did he mean, would I like kids with
him? My mind went into overdrive, imagining little infants with nerdy glasses, working on Facebook
servers.
Huh, kids? I came back to reality. Yeah, I do like children. Never thought I would but at
some point I do want to have messy, naughty kids.
Me too, he said.
We came out of the zoo and walked further north.
We reached the famous Bethesda fountain, located at the edge of The Lake. We sat on the steps
and watched ducks with their ducklings swim in little groups. The sun had dimmed, and the water
reflected the evening sky.
We sat in silence for five minutes before I spoke again.
Brijesh, we spoke about several things. We didnt talk about our past relationships, I said.
Boyfriends and girlfriends, that sort of stuff.
Oh, he said.
Yes. Should we or not? We dont know each other so well yet, I said.
But isnt that the point? Anyway, better to discuss such things.
Yeah. So, youve had relationships? I said.
He turned his gaze away from the ducks and looked into my eyes.
Only one, he said.
Oh, the special one.
I dont know. It was a long time ago. I told you I was distracted during my IIT preparation,
right?
Yeah.
She was in my coaching classes.
Okay, I said. A girlfriend?
I liked her for roughly two years. She liked me too. Unfortunately we expressed our feelings
too late. We only dated for two months.
Meaning?
Her father took up a job in Saudi Arabia. She moved there with her family.
I am sorry, I said.
Its okay, he said and smiled. It was a long time ago.
How about you? he said. You have had relationships?
Nothing in India. I did have a relationship in New York and, well, I dont know what to call
it, but something in Hong Kong. So yeah. Two. Or one and a half.
Oh, he said, somewhat surprised.
Yeah. I did. God, I feel lighter telling you that. I dont know why but I do.
He smiled.
Its over, though. Both of them ended. A long time ago, I said.
Did it hurt when they ended? he said.
Yes, it did, I said and smiled, but I am okay now.
He did not probe further.
Would you like to know anything more? I said.
Not really. Only if and when you want to tell me, he said.
We looked at the ducks again.
He spoke after a few minutes. So what do you think? About us?
Did he want a decision from me? After one afternoon tea and one walk in the park? Is that
how arranged marriages work? What should I do?
I thought before I spoke.
Brijesh, I did like meeting you. But this is such a big decision, right?
Of course. Take your time. Go back. Think. Reflect.
I will. Should we walk out of the park so I can call an Uber to the airport? I said.
You wont get such a good match again and again. He is US-based. You can easily get a transfer to
his city. He makes good money. He has shares. You say he is sweet. Really, beta, I cant find you
anything better than this.
My mother, back in India now, had called me during my lunch break in the office.
But mom. . .
The Gulatis have called twice.
I need time to think.
No prince on a horse will come. Certainly not through shaadi.com.
I didnt say I want a prince.
So come down to earth. What do you know about men anyway?
Yeah, what do I know, I thought. If I did, I would have made them stick around, right?
I remained silent.
I liked him. I could say yes. Maybe not an oh my God wow type yes, but at least theres no
reason to say no kind of yes. Still, I wanted to be cautious.
Its okay, mom. Whatever. Okay, if you guys like him then yeah, its a yes.
Really?
Yeah. I sighed.
Its a yes! Aditis papa, are you there? Mubarak, I heard her scream.
It drowned out everythingmy voice, reason and doubts. I, Radhika Mehta, was going to get
married. Congratulations, Radhika, I whispered to myself after I hung up the phone.

ey, you are here, Neels voice brought me back to my present reality. Waves continued to
splash on the beach outside. He placed his hand on my shoulder.
Come, lets sit and talk.
I brushed his hand aside and turned to him.
Neel, I need to go. I really should, I said. My cousins would soon start looking for me for
sangeet practice.
Give me five minutes. I need to tell you something, he said. He had a large brown envelope
in his hand. We sat down on the chocolate-brown sofa.
Let me talk, okay? he said.
Sure, I said, my gaze away from him.
And look at me, please, he said.
I turned to him. The same sparkly eyes, beautiful face and chiselled features. I could see why I
had loved him.
I want to say three things, he said.
Im listening, I said.
But before that, may I just say one extra thing? You look nice in this white salwar-kameez.
This? Well, thanks. Its for the sangeet practice.
I have never seen you in Indian clothes.
Really? I said. Of course he hadnt. He had only seen me in work clothes or, well, no
clothes.
Indian clothes suit you. You look like a little fairy.
I dont know why he talks like this. Worse, I dont know why it still feels so good when he
talks like this.
You came here for this? To comment on my salwar-kameez?
No, no. That is just a side observation.
Talk about what you came for.
One, Radhika, I am really, really sorry. For how things ended between us. I am just an idiot.
A total idiot.
Well, we parted ways, I moved to London. End of story, I said and let out a deep breath.
Yeah, I never considered that the story could end differently. There were other options.
Its history. Leave it, Neel.
Well, I cant leave it. Since you left, I have missed you every single day. I cant even bear to
pass your cubicle. Every bit of Hong Kong, every business trip reminds me of you. I am filled with
pain every time the taxi passes Old Peak Road.
There are other routes to your house, I am sure, I said.
He looked at me. I stared back.
I am sorry, Radhika. I loved you. So much. You were the best thing to ever happen to me. Or
ever will. Smart, young, beautiful, compatible and successful. I had you. You loved me. And what did
I do with it? Nothing.
I didnt respond.
I made the biggest mistake of my life. I really did, he said.
Now, where else had I heard that line recently?
He placed the brown envelope on the table. He clasped his hands and lifted them in front of
me.
I know you dont believe me. But only I know the hell I went through after you left. That is
why I am here.
I believe you, Neel. I missed you too. However, we couldnt do anything about it, right? So
yeah, whats the point of you being here?
For the second thing I am going to tell you.
He picked up the brown envelope. He pulled out a set of A4-sized sheets. The first page had a
stamp paper.
I am leaving Kusum. These are the documents, he said.
I felt dizzy. The suite spun around me. He gave me the papers in my hand. He and Kusum had
filed for a mutual consent divorce at the Hong Kong Family Court. My hand began to tremble.
I put the divorce documents on the table.
Why? I said.
You are asking me why? he said. You, of all people?
You had a perfect family.
If I did, why did we have what we had?
I kept silent. His eyes became wet.
What about the kids?
We plan to co-parent. Share custody.
What did Kusum say?
Not happy, of course. However, she gets it. She knew something was amiss in our marriage.
We had grown too far apart.
What will she do? I said. I dont know why I had such concern for his ex-wife.
She will figure it out. Financially, she is more than okay. I gave her half of whatever I had. No
questions asked. In return, she agreed to co-parenting and mutual consent.
I couldnt believe I was discussing a divorce at my wedding venue.
Neel continued, I am sorry, I will skip the details. The point is, he said and exhaled, my
marriage is over.
I am sorry, Neel, I said.
Its okay, he said and massaged his temples. It had to happen. Should have happened long
ago.
I checked my phone. I had missed calls from two of my cousins.
I hope you are okay. I need to go now. You had something else to say? The third thing? I said.
Yes. Theres a small plane waiting at the Dabolim airport.
Your chartered flight?
Yeah, Radhika, he said and leaned forward to hold my hand. Our flight.
What? I said. I didnt withdraw my hand. I just gave a quick glance to confirm the door was
shut.
I know this will be a huge mess for you. Your entire family is here. There are huge expenses.
But hear me out.
What?
I will cut a cheque right now, at the hotel lobby. I will pay for everything your family or the
grooms side spent for this wedding. So financially, its a non-issue. You just come with me, and we
fly away on the plane. To Hong Kong. To wherever, actually.
Neel, are you kidding me?
No. I mean it. I have wasted too much time. I have over-analysed, treated our love like it was
a financial deal. It doesnt work like that. You have to do these things from here.
He touched his chest to indicate his heart.
You want me to elope with you? I said, still absorbing his proposal-cum-plan.
You can talk to your family. I can meet them as well. When we reach Hong Kong we can get
married.
What if I dont want to be in Hong Kong?
Neel became quiet for a few seconds.
It would be nice if we can be there for a while, he finally said. My kids are there. But if it
bothers you we can move to another city. I will commute. See them from time to time.
I looked at him searchingly. I knew him well enough to tell he wasnt lying. Neel Gupta,
partner at Goldman Sachs, never uttered a word if he didnt mean it. I kept my gaze on him for a
minute.
Say something, he said.
What am I supposed to say? I have to dance to chittiyan kalaiyan now.
Whats that?
A Bollywood song. For my sangeet.
Wait, thats Punjabi, right? What does it mean?
Fair-complexioned wrists, white wrists, actually, I said.
Of course, its India. Has to be white. So you dancing and all? With all those hip moves? he
said. I nodded.
Both of us laughed. For a moment it felt like old times, when he and I would chat over
breakfast at the Goldman café.
Look, I dont want to deny us a celebration. We can do a court marriage now in Hong Kong.
Later, when the dust settles, we can have our own big fat Indian wedding. One in India and one in
London, for my folks.
I realized he hadnt let go of my hand. He slid off the sofa and knelt down. He lifted my hand
and kissed it.
My beautiful Indian princess, rather I should say smart, analytically sound and extremely
beautiful Indian princess, will you marry me?
My heart beat fast. Neel, unattainable crush of most Goldman girls who had met him, the man
whom I loved, was in front of me on his knees.
Please, princess, say yes, he said.
My phone rang. I wanted a disruption to avoid answering Neel. I picked up the call without
looking at the caller id.
One sec, Neel, I said.
Baby, where are you? Debus voice on the other side made me jump.
Hey, I got to call you back, I said.
Okay listen, I called home and. . .
Talk to you later, I said and hung up.
All fine? Neel said, still on his knees.
I nodded.
He lifted my hand up again.
Radhika Mehta, I love you and will always do. Will you marry me?
I pulled my hand back. I smacked my forehead.
Fuck, Neel. Really, fuck, I said.
What, Radhika?
You had to do all this now? Where were you in Hong Kong, when I lay silently crying in bed
next to you?
You were crying? I couldnt hear.
Silently crying. And you said I am not the marriage type. What was that? I am not meant to be
a mother?
I freaked out. I didnt want what we had to end. I couldnt figure out how to keep you.
I stood up.
How did you figure it out now? I said, or rather screamed, and pointed to the papers. Did
you even suggest any such options then? I was the young VP at work you slept with. Thats all I could
be, right?
I understand you are upset. I didnt treat you right.
I came to resign. It didnt matter to you. The best you could do was to arrange a transfer.
Wow.
Why didnt you shout at me then?
Huh? I said, twisting my dupattas edge.
You could have told me that what I was doing was wrong.
You had a family. What am I supposed to say to you? Lets be together. Leave your wife and
little kids?
I wish you had, he said in a bleak voice.
I paced up and down his suite a few times. He sat there, still on his knees.
Sit on the sofa, Neel. There is no need to be so dramatic.
He complied and sat back on the sofa.
Fine. Not dramatic, but be pragmatic, he said.
This is so stupid, Neel. Really, I expected better from you.
So I acted late. Is that what your anger is about? Go ahead, yell at me.
Thats not the point.
I missed you every day. I didnt contact you. But I did what I had to do with my life. Then I
heard about your wedding and it was now or never. So I came here. To take you away. With me.
Forever.
He walked up to me. He held my shoulders with both hands.
Neel, just stop, I said.
Fine, hit me. Slap me. You did it once. Do it again. As many times as you want. But come
with me.
I felt his breath on my face. He had Ralph Laurens Romance on, the same perfume he used to
wear when he came to bed with me.
Leave me, Neel, I said, even though I didnt make any effort to extract myself from his grip.
He held my shoulders tighter.
I said leave me, I said, my voice breaking. I started to cry.
Radhika, what is with you and your tear taps?
Shh, he said, enough now. Its okay. I am here now. Its all going to be fine.
He placed his hand on the back of my head. He pushed my head forward until my forehead
rested on his chest. He didnt try and kiss me. He just patted my head a couple of times. He brought
his mouth close to my ear and whispered, I will be here, in this room. The pilot is waiting for my
instructions. You calm down. Go back and think. Its a lot for you to take in. I will wait until you give
the go-ahead. Then we will do what we have to.
I nodded.
I lifted my head.
I need to go. I really do, I said.
I raced down the hotel corridor, my mind racing a million times faster than my steps. At the function
room entrance, I found Debu.
Debu! I said, looking around to ensure nobody saw us. What are you doing here?
Baby, I tried calling you so many times. You dont pick up.
I couldnt talk to him here. Anyone from my or Brijeshs family could walk in anytime. I saw a
staff door near the function room. I pushed it open. Debu and I entered the kitchen area of the hotel.
You cant land up here like this, I said.
I had no choice. I thought you would be at the sangeet practice. I didnt see you there.
A chef next to us fried a kilo of onions on full heat.
You went in? I said, aghast.
I pretended to be lost. Another guest in the hotel.
Never do that again, okay?
Sorry. We only have one more day, Radhika. I called to tell you I spoke to my parents.
About what?
About us. About everything we had. And the situation we are in now. I had a two-hour call.
Debu, I am not exaggerating this. But my head is a big mess and might explode right now.
My phone rangmy mother was calling.
I have to take this, I said. My mother shouted at me as soon as I picked up the call.
Are you mad? Where have you disappeared? Your cousins are looking for you all over the
hotel.
I am here only, I said.
Where?
In the toilet.
Why are you taking so long? Is your stomach okay? Eat carefully, dont get loose motions on
your wedding day. You need medicine?
Mom, I am fine. Two minutes. Okay, bye.
I hung up and looked at Debu.
You heard that? I said. See how everyone is looking for me?
I am sorry. Anyway, my parents protested a lot, but I convinced them. They want to come
here.
Please, Debu.
I just need your decision. I am your first love, Radhika. First and only. You dont even know
this guy you are getting married to.
I have more choices now, I wanted to tell him.
What do you want me to say? I said instead.
I tried to walk past him. He blocked me with his arm.
Stop this wedding. Tell your parents. I will come with you. Its now or never.
Can I, I said and paused, can I think about this, Debu? Really? I have practice now.
Yeah, he said and lowered his hand.
Thanks, I said.
I will love you until the last day of my life, he said from behind me.
F

ocus, Radhika madam. Your feet are not matching the beat, Mickey, the choreographer, said to
me. Though he was ticking me off for the fifteenth time he had remarkable patience in his voice. In his
place, I would have slapped my student.
Neither do I have chittiyan kalaiyan in real life, nor can I do the steps for chittiyan kalaiyan, I
said.
He played the original song with Jacqueline Fernandes on the LED screen behind the stage.
My six cousins who had to dance with me had mastered each move down pat. I couldnt keep up
beyond five steps.
I couldnt hear the lyrics or Mickeys instructions. I only heard the following in my ears:
Debu. Neel. Brijesh.
Debu. Neel. Brijesh.
I heard I love yous in Debus and Neels voices. I heard Brijesh saying he wants to go
apartment-hunting in San Francisco. I heard Neel talking about the waiting plane. I imagined Debus
Bengali parents packing their bags along with their monkey caps and buying rasgulla tins for their
Goa trip. Mickey paused and replayed the song for the sixteenth time.
One-two-three, Radhika madam, start, he said.
Chittiyan kalaiyan ve, o meri chittiyaan kalaiyan ve.
Chittiyan kalaiyan ve, o meri white kalaiyan ve.
I tried to dance. The image of Neel making love to me on the Philippines island flashed in my
head. It switched to Debu and me sitting in our Tribeca apartment and watching TV together. I came
back to reality, and tried to remember the steps.
Madam, again you are missing the beat. What is happening? Cut, cut. Restart.
Three more attempts for Radhika the wobbly-toed bride. Well, turns out I sucked at these
attempts too.
Finally, Mickey stopped the music.
Only Radhika maam now. Cousins, please leave stage, he said. He meant business. He
played the song again. I came to the middle of the stage. In the first stanza, I had to lift my wrists to my
face and move my eyes. Instead, I stood still. My legs felt weak. I dropped to my knees. I sank on to
the stage floor and burst into tears. I cried loud enough to make the choreographer come running to
me. He feared he would lose his job.
Sorry, madam. I am sorry. We dont have to do this dance.
It wasnt the dance. It was the thoughts that danced in my head. What on earth was I supposed
to do?
Madam, I change song? Romantic song? Aashiqui 2? Tum hi ho? Just walk around looking
sad. Easy. Try?
I shook my head. My cousins ran up to the stage and surrounded me.
What happened, didi? Sweety said.
Nothing, I said. I am so useless. I cant get these stupid steps.
Didi, I can be the centre girl, Sweety said.
How can you be the centre girl? Are you the bride or what? Idiot, Pinky, another second
cousin of mine, said.
My mother came up to us.
What is happening? she said to me.
I stood up. I gave her a tight hug. I cried again. She patted my back.
Calm down, my bitiya. Every girl has to leave her parents home one day.
Sure, thats what she thought this was. I am crying at the thought of leaving home. Never
mind I have not lived at home for years anyway.
Give her a break. She will do it in a few hours, my mother said.
But, madam, sangeet is this evening, Mickey said in a concerned voice.
She will do it later, my mother said in her trademark stern, no-more-negotiation voice.
I came back to my room with my mother.
Rest, I am sitting here, my mother said.
I lay down in bed. My mother opened a newspaper and sat next to me.
Mom, I said.
Close your eyes. Try to sleep.
Mom, I want to talk to you about something important, I said.
What? she said. Oh, did Aditi call the beauty parlour? Their staff should have come.
Anyway, what?
I looked at her face. Where do I even begin with her?
Nothing, mom, its personal and I dont know if I should. . .
It doesnt hurt so much, she said.
What? I said, surprised.
Sex. I know you must be tense. It doesnt hurt so much.
Really, mom? I said, my sarcasm not evident to her.
Yeah. See, I am not like those backward mothers who cant talk frank with daughter. I talk
frank. Thats what you wanted to say, right?
Yeah, pretty much, I said.
Good. Rest. And do chittiyan kalaiyan only. No sad tragic songs at my daughters sangeet.
Suraj and his team of decorators outdid themselves on sangeet night. Bollywood posters from movies
of every decade adorned the walls. Streamers made from fresh white lilies and deep-red roses filled
the entire room. The stage had the look of a Bollywood item number set, complete with matkis and
disco balls. It all felt over the top, like every Punjabi wedding should, and it worked. Guests roamed
around the function room appreciating the decorations. I wore an onion-coloured flowing lehenga
along with an elaborate diamond set. I looked at myself in the mirror.
Stunning you look, didi, Sweety said. I couldnt recognize myself after the one-hour make-up
session. For a second, I wished Debu and Neel could see me like this. Yeah, thats how I felt on the
eve of my wedding, wishing my exes who waited within bluetooth range could see me dolled up.
After a nap in my room I had gone back for the sangeet practice. Sometimes the only way to
calm your mind is to keep it distracted and busy.
I had rehearsed in the afternoon with the doggedness of an Everest climber. I didnt have
another financial model to build. I decided to take on chittiyan kalaiyan instead. You look beautiful,
madam. All the best for the stage, Mickey said to me in the evening.
Brijesh came up to me.
You look. . . Brijesh said, very nice.
Thanks, I said. I kept a straight face. I had to talk to him. Before I could begin, he spoke
again. Actually, more than nice. Beautiful. Stunning. Basically, great.
You look sharp too, I said. He wore a cream-coloured shervani suit with a self-design. He
had switched to contact lenses for the night, getting rid of his Sundar Pichai spectacles.
Together, we met elders on each side. We touched everyones feet enough times to count as
two sets of abdominal crunches.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, Pankaj mama took the stage. He held a whisky glass in
one hand and a mike in the other.
Welcome to the most beautiful wedding sangeet of the most beautiful daughter of my most
beautiful sister, he said. Obviously, the most beautiful whisky had already reached his head.
Mickeys troupe performed two professional dance numbers first. We sat through them and
clapped at the end of each. The highlight of the evening, the aunts dance performance, came next.
Now we have the mamis and buas on either side performing to London thumakda, Pankaj
mama announced to thundering applause. He did a little jig on stage himself in anticipation.
Eight aunts took to the stage. The LED screen showed a London backdrop with the picture of
Big Ben. Each aunt had enough gold on her to make the down payment for an apartment in London.
The stage creaked as everyone took initial positions.
The song began. Richter-scale-nine-level pandemonium rocked the stage. The aunties matched
the original steps for fifteen seconds. After that every Punjabi aunts head, limb and torso seemed to
have a mind of its own. Two aunts banged into each other. Another one had her bangles tangled up in
someone elses hair. But they continued to dance. The crowd roared.
Tu ghanti Big Ben di
Pura London thumakda
If the British had seen this tribute to London, they would never have colonized us.
Choreographer Mickeys mouth fell open. He covered his face with his hands, wondering if he
had chosen the wrong profession. Never had his students massacred his lessons to this level.
Brijesh stood next to me. He looked at me and grinned. I hid a smile; after all, they were my
aunts.
I checked my phone. It had two messages each from Neel and Debu. I didnt open them.
Instead, I placed my phone in Aditi didis handbag.
Your turn is coming soon, Aditi didi said.
Didi, I dont feel like it, I said.
What? Your cousins are already backstage. They have waited for this moment since they came
to Goa, she said.
All the best, Brijesh said as the time came for me to go backstage.
Can you get me a drink, Brijesh? I said.
Huh? Yeah, sure. What do you want?
Anything.
Whisky?
Sure, I said.
He returned from the bar with a large peg of Black Label. I chugged it in one shot.
Take it easy. Dont be tense. Its just a dance, Brijesh said.
Its not the dance. We have to talk, I said.
Pinky came and tugged at my lehenga. I had to go.
Well talk later, I said.
What? Sure. Hey, rock it! Brijesh said.
On my way backstage, my mother stopped me.
What were you doing? she said.
What? I said.
I saw you. You asked Brijesh for whisky and drank it like a cheap bar girl. In front of him?
So? I said, confidence soaring after the whisky shot. I wanted to loosen up before the
dance.
Do you have any brains? Your in-laws are watching you. What will they think? Their bahu
drinks like a jungli bewdi.
Mom. My would-be husband gave me the drink. If he doesnt have a problem, whats their
problem?
My mother gave me a dirty look. Pinky pulled my hand.
My suggestion, mom, is go get a drink for yourself. You need it, I said to my mother as I left
the function room.
I survived the stage. I did not let my choreographer down. I remembered all my steps. I nailed
chittiyan kalaiyan, even though I found it more challenging than foreclosing the assets of a distressed
Chinese factory. The audience cheered. Mickey kept repeating one-two-three-four and turn round and
round and one-two-three-four from behind the stage.
The song ended. My cousins and I finished our performance with a huge group hug. The
audience broke into applause.
Why does one have to get married to have so much fun? Why cant extended families just
get together once in a while and dance for no reason?
The crowd gave us a standing ovation. Brijesh clapped the hardest, perhaps not expecting his
investment banker bride-to-be to break a leg on stage as well.
You were fabulous. You are a good, good dancer, he said.
Oh no, I suck. Those four minutes took four hours of merciless practice.
I couldnt do that even with four months of training, he said.
A waiter with drinks passed us. I stopped him and gave Brijesh a glass of whisky.
Drink up, I said.
Are you sure? We still have to meet so many people.
You will need it. We need to talk, I said.
What?
Before I could answer, lights dimmed in the function room. A DJ took over. The stage now
became a free-for-all dance floor. In Punjabi weddings this means first the kids take over the floor.
Then their elder teen cousins come and kick them off the stage. Next, all the uncles get drunk and
shove the teenagers off. Finally, the uncles get so drunk that they even drag their wives, or the aunties,
on to the stage.
Brijesh and I also danced to a few songs. Brijesh was right. He couldnt dance. Imagine Bill
Gates or Mark Zuckerberg trying to do bhangra. You get the idea.
After three songs, I whispered in Brijeshs ear, Brijesh, lets step out and talk.
M
39
y ears felt a sense of relief as the DJs music faded out as we left the function room. We
came out to the Marriott garden, dark and silent at night. The December air had a mild chill
to it and I rubbed my hands together.
Where are we going? Brijesh said.
Out of sight, I said. I found a palm tree with a bench underneath it. We sat down, adjacent to
each other, facing the sea.
Isnt it nice to just breathe? I said.
It is, but they will look for us, Brijesh said. A search party will be sent soon.
Its all a bit crazy. This whole jingbang of two clans. Getting too much now, I said.
Dont worry, in two days all the guests will be gone. Just you and me then.
Yeah, I said. I wondered how and where to start. He continued to talk.
And soon we will be on a plane to Bali, he said.
Yeah, Brijesh, about that. . . I said.
He ignored me and continued to talk, all excited. And once we get back from Bali to SF, I
have lined up apartment viewings that weekend. Hope thats okay?
Brijesh, I cant do this, I said.
What? Too hectic? Okay, we can see apartments later. Its just that my current apartment is too
small and. . .
I am not talking about the apartment hunt.
Then?
This. Whatever is going on. I am sorry. I cant do this.
What? Relatives? They are getting on my nerves too. How many more feet do we have to
touch?
I held his shoulder. I turned him towards me.
Brijesh, I cannot get married, I said.
What? he said in genuine confusion. Sorry, beg your pardon?
You heard me.
He looked at me and laughed.
What? I said.
You are so funny. Sweet also.
He pulled my cheek.
Sweet? I said. What is so sweet about me leaving him high and dry at the altar?
You are nervous. And so like a little child, you are saying I cant do this. Its sweet only.
Its not. . . I said as he interrupted me.
I am scared too. I live alone. Now I will have this other person living with me for the rest of
my life. It petrifies me.
It does. Yes. And this is just too soon.
Too soon? We have planned this for months.
We planned the event for months. However, we decided so soon.
You said yes. I said yes. We had to reach a decision, right?
Brijesh. Can you please trust me? I cant do this.
He smiled again. He placed an arm around my shoulder.
From now on, your fears are mine, and mine are yours. So be scared or whatever, I am with
you.
I got off the bench. I turned around to face him.
Brijesh, I dont think you are getting me. It is not nervousness. Theres stuff I need to deal
with and my head is a huge squishy mess.
I am sorry to hear that. But. . . he paused.
But what?
But 200 people are dancing inside to celebrate us coming together. A mood swing cannot
dictate our decision now.
Its not a mood swing, Brijesh.
What is it then? Something you want to tell me?
Its my past. I still have to come to terms with it.
He paused to look at me, wondering what I meant.
We all do. It happens over time.
Its about my future too. About what I want.
Brijeshs phone rang. He smiled.
There, the search party is out, he said and picked up the phone. Yeah, dad. I am here,
stepped out for some air. Yeah, Radhika is with me. Just chatting, dad. Okay, we are coming.
He ended the call and turned at me.
The elders are leaving. They want to bless the couple before they go to bed, he said and
smiled.
Sorry Brijesh, I. . .
We have to go now. Listen, Radhika, I am no expert on women. Maybe this is how all women
think the night before their wedding.
Not all.
Maybe in arranged marriages they do. We still dont know each other. Can I suggest
something?
What?
Go to your room. Rest. Please sleep. All these guests and huge celebrations are bothering
you.
Well, I only chose to have a grand wedding like this.
Exactly. So maybe your doubts are just irrational last-minute fears. Sleep on it. You will feel
better. Lets go now, he said.
But. . . I said.
Dads calling again, Brijesh said as he picked up his phone.
I took my phone back from Aditi didis bag when I got to my room.
I checked the time. 2 a.m. I hadnt unlocked my phone to read my messages yet. Message
notifications flooded my phone home screen. They read like this:
Debu: Hey baby, whats up?
Debu: Is there anything I can do to help? Can I talk to anyone on your side?
Debu: 5 more messages
Neel: In my room. Here if you need me.
Neel: When can we talk?
Neel: You around? Can we meet? Like for a minute?
Neel: 3 more messages
Brijesh: Hope you are fine? Get some rest, okay?
Brijesh: Its all going to be okay. Stay calm.
How am I supposed to stay calm? A dozen messages from three different men, every hour.
And I have a wedding tomorrow. Mine. I have no clue with whom. How am I supposed to stay calm?
Aditi didi slept next to me. She woke up for water and noticed the lit phone screen in my hand.
Sleep, you idiot. You will have dark circles in all your wedding pictures.
Yeah, that should be my biggest concern. Would the make-up lady apply enough concealer to
hide my dark circles? Why cant I be like other girls? Why am I not thinking about how my lehenga
looked on me tonight? Why am I not worried about my nails? Why am I thinking about my dark life
rather than my dark circles?
Ting. Another message.
Put it on silent, Aditi didi groaned in a sleepy voice, and come to bed.
I looked at my phone screen.
Suraj: Hope you liked decorations, madam. Your dance was too good.
I shut the phone. I closed my eyes. But I couldnt sleep.
What do I do? Who is it going to be? Debu, Neel or Brijesh? Oh, Radhika the great
distressed analyst, how do you analyse your way out of this distressed situation?
Some people are good at taking decisions. I am not one of them. Some people fall asleep quickly at
night. I am not one of them either. It is 3 in the morning. I have tossed and turned in bed for two hours.
I am to get married in fifteen hours. We have over 200 guests in the hotel, here to attend my grand
destination wedding. Everyone is excited. It is the first destination wedding in the Mehta family.
I am the bride. I should get my beauty sleep. I cant. The last thing I care about right now is
beauty. The only thing I care about is how to get out of this mess. Because, like it often happens to me
in life, here I am yet again in a situation where I dont know what the fuck is going on.
I lay still in bed for another half an hour. I thought about what I could do. I noticed Aditi didi
in deep sleep. I stared at the flickering red light of the smoke alarm on the ceiling. At 3.30 a.m., I
stepped out of bed. I opened the room curtains. The sea appeared pitch black. The light from a few
distant ships flickered in the background. Moonlight filled my eyes.
Its your life, Radhika, take control of it, a voice inside me said. The voice was calm, unlike
the hysterical mini-me who usually yelled.
Who is this? I said to myself.
Its me. Your inner voice.
The critic inside me? The one who thinks I am a total bitch?
No, the one who thinks you deserve to be happy.
Really? I have a person like that inside? I said in my head and chuckled.
We all do.
Well, so what do I do? Who do I choose?
Stay still, Radhika. Stay still. The answers will come.
I did exactly that. I sat still for half an hour, almost in meditation. I kept my eyes fixed on the
dark sea outside. Slowly, a weight lifted off me. I knew what I had to do.
I took out my phone. I sent an identical message to Debu, Neel and Brijesh:
You there?
Debu replied first, in a few seconds.
Yes, baby, trying to sleep but cant.
Meet me for breakfast. 5 a.m. Hotel coffee shop, I answered.
Oh really? Thats great! Thats just in an hour. See you!
He also sent me a few excited and happy smileys.
Thanks, I replied, see you.
Neel responded after ten minutes.
Yes, am here, he said.
I copy-pasted a line from Debus chat to Neel.
Meet me for breakfast. 5 a.m. Hotel coffee shop, I sent to him.
Okay sure, Neel said.
Brijesh replied at 4.30.
Hey, good morning. You are up early. Did you get some rest? he said.
I am okay.
Good. Whats up?
I copy-pasted the line from Debus chat with one modification on the time.
Meet me for breakfast. 5.30 a.m. Hotel coffee shop.
Really? So early?
Can you? Please.
Of course. See you.
I put my phone aside. I let out a big breath. Aditi didi woke up.
What are you doing on the sofa?
Fixing my life, I said.
What?
Nothing. Just going for a shower, I said and went into the bathroom.
I
40
reached the coffee shop at 5 a.m. Neel and Debu had already arrived. They sat at separate tables,
unaware of their common link through me. Debu wore a light-blue kurta and pajama that along
with his beard and spectacles made him look like a communist intellectual. Neel wore a crisp darkblue
shirt with a buttoned-down collar and a well-ironed pair of beige shorts. I wore a simple lightblue
chikan salwar-kameez. It felt ten times more comfortable and lighter than the wedding fineries I
had worn all week.
Four IndiGo Airlines crew members occupied another table, sipping coffee before their early
morning flight. Apart from them the coffee shop had no other customers. The coffee shop was open on
the side, facing the sea. Daylight had just broken. The sky had streaks of pink in it. The morning
breeze felt cool in my hair, still wet after the shower.
Neel and Debu stood up at their respective tables as I entered the coffee shop. They walked
towards me from two different directions.
Hey, Debu said.
Hi there, you look fresh, Neel said.
Neel and Debu looked at each other, surprised and confused.
Good morning. Debu, this is Neel. Neel, this is Debu, I said.
Good. . .morning, Debu said, as he tried to figure out the situation.
Hi, Neel said to Debu.
Lets get some breakfast, I said.
I sat down at one of the sea-facing tables. Both of them froze where they stood.
Come, both of you, I said and smiled.
They sat down hesitantly. The waiter arrived to take the order.
I will have a cappuccino and brown-bread toast. With peanut butter and honey. How about
you guys? I said.
Debu and Neel looked at each other.
Black coffee. Porridge, please, Neel said.
Er. . .orange juice, Debu said.
The waiter left. I continued to smile, enjoying their confused state.
Is he a friend? Neel said, asking about Debu.
Yeah, you could say that, I said.
You want to introduce me properly? Debu said, clearing his throat.
Of course I will.
Yeah, because sorry, Debu, I dont know you and so it is all a bit confusing and surprising. . .
Neel was saying when I cut him off.
Both of you are my exes. My past lovers, I said.
If there were prizes for priceless expressions, Neel and Debu could both share a Nobel.
Sorry, I dont understand, Neel said. I am an ex but who is he?
Debu. My boyfriend in New York, remember?
Oh, that guy, Neel said.
Neel is your ex too? Sorry, when was this? Debu said.
Hong Kong.
Oh, Debu said, and became silent. He studied Neel openly.
Yeah, hes older, Debu. Much older, I said. Neels married too.
Debu realized I had caught him staring at Neel and took his gaze away from him.
I was. Not now, Neel corrected me. So Debus come to attend your wedding? Thats nice.
Hes not come to attend it. Hes come to marry me. He wants to sit in the grooms place. Right
here, in Goa.
What? Neel said. I thought things ended badly for you guys. Debus the same guy who made
you leave New York, right?
Yeah, I said. Change of heart now. Just like you.
I guess it takes a while for people to realize my worth.
I turned to Debu.
And, Debu, Neel is here to stop the wedding too. His style is a bit different. It involves
chartered planes.
Debus eyes popped open.
You see, he is rich. Something you always had a problem with.
I. . .I. . .I. . . Debu stuttered as he struggled to string a sentence. I have no problem with
someone who is rich. Who said I did?
Neel interjected, Radhika, I didnt mean to display my wealth. It just seemed like the best
option.
Neel, it doesnt matter. But understand the situation, guys. Both of you are here to stop my
wedding, which is in a few hours. Not only that, you want me to marry you instead. As you can
imagine, you have put me in quite a predicament.
The waiter arrived with our food. As he served us, Neel and Debu shifted in their seats,
avoided eye contact with each other. I leisurely spread peanut butter on my toast. I saw the unease on
their faces. Debu spoke after the waiter left.
Sorry, Radhika. I didnt realize you have another ex-boyfriend here. Was this gentleman even
a boyfriend, actually? He is so much older and married.
Not married anymore. And my name is Neel, Neel Gupta, Neel said, loosening the collar of
his shirt.
Yeah, whatever. But, Radhika, I thought you and I are meeting here alone. In any case, you
need to come with me.
Why? You forgot how you treated her? She had to leave the country for you, Neel said.
Even for you, Neel, I said.
Neel looked at me with a stumped expression.
Radhika, I said sorry. I never disrespected you. I may have had some confusion. But now I
dont. I am only human.
Debu interrupted Neel.
Mr Neel, find someone your own age.
Its the connection that matters, not the age. And sorry to say, I seem fitter than you, Neel
said.
I couldnt believe the discussion. I had to make an effort not to grin. For a few seconds I
relished these two men fighting over me. I imagined them in a fistfight; though I knew Neel would
clobber the intellectual Bengali babu in the end, I could have watched them duel all day. But I did not
have the time.
Boys, boys, stop arguing. And listen to what I have to say for once, I said.
I know you love me, baby, Debu said. I am your first love.
Which is often a mistake. We connect, Radhika, beyond love. We are similar. You know that,
Neel said.
Why do you guys love the sound of your voice so much? Can I speak, uninterrupted? I said.
Both of them nodded. Neel clasped his hands and placed his elbows on the table. Debu took a
sip of his orange juice.
Thanks, I said. Sorry, I am doing this to you together. Just more efficient. Also, maybe you
can learn something from each other.
Its fine, Neel said, eager not to censure me.
Debashish Sen, you remember our walk in New York? You said women could do anything.
You quoted feminist texts. Essentially, you said women could and should fly.
Yeah, Debu said.
Nice in theory. In real life the girl throws a party for her guys promotion but the guy cannot
handle the girls bonus. Yes?
Thats not. . . he said but I stopped him.
Let me speak. You said fly, but when I flew high, you wanted to clip my wings. Fly, as long as
you fly beneath me, is it?
He looked down. I turned to Neel.
Neel, you loved me as the flying bird. You wanted me to fly higher and higher.
Of course, Neel said.
But you know where you went wrong?
Where? Neel said.
You didnt want me to have a nest.
Neel didnt have an answer.
Neel? I said.
I believe in equal rights. You know that, right? Neel said.
Did you realize that perhaps I did not want to fool around? Perhaps equal rights means giving
women the same rights, not the same things? Equal rights to get what they want, rather than equal
rights to the same things men want.
I noticed Debu scratch his head as he also heard and tried to figure out what I said.
Meaning? Neel said.
What do you want? Career? Home? Debu said. I am really confused.
Yeah. What do you want? Choose whatever you like, Radhika, Neel said.
I took a sip of my lukewarm coffee.
Ah, choose, I said and sneered. Choice. The benchmark word of feminism, right? I become
a great feminist if I give women the choice of home or career.
What do you mean? Isnt that how it should be? Neel said.
Yeah, why not? Isnt that fair? Giving women the choice? Debu said.
No. It is still unfair. Because heres the deal. You know what women really want? We dont
want to choose. We want to fly and we also want a beautiful nest. We want both. Do male birds tell
female birds to choose? Hey honey, choose. Either fly or sit in the nest.
I dont get it. Really, Debu said. Even Neel looked confused.
From a mans perspective, men want a career, right? In general?
Yeah, Debu said.
Men want sex, right? No judgement, but they want sex, right?
Yeah, Neel said.
I collected my thoughts before I spoke again.
Lets say, in the name of male rights, men are given a choice. Come on guys, choose. You
want a career? Go for it, just give up sex. Oh, you want sex? Just worship women all day and give up
your career dreams. So choose, we are giving you equal rights. Choose now. Sex or career?
Sorry but that is a ridiculous choice to make, Neel said.
Exactly, Neel. It is indeed a ridiculous choice. Just as ridiculous as the choice given to
womenfly or nest. You want and get both. But a woman must choose?
I had three sips of coffee before Neel had something to say.
I get it. Women want everything. To have a lovely home and be a great mother. To also have a
chance to shine in their careers, Neel said.
Not all, maybe, but for many, yes, I said.
How is it practically possible? Career means long office hours. Home means kids,
responsibilities, Debu said.
Exactly! Have you thought why its not practical? I said.
Why? Debu said.
Because men designed this world. They decided office timings, 9 to 6, five days a week.
Women werent in the workforce then. They are now. These office timings work well for men. They
dont work for mothers, for instance. What are we going to do about it?
We as in us three? Debu said.
No, we as in the whole world, I said. When will we say, lets rejig this to ensure it works
for women? Forget rejig, when will we even acknowledge the issue?
I paused to catch my breath, then leaned forward as if to listen to them. Debu finished his
orange juice in one quick swallow.
You have a point. Conceded. I didnt realize your strong need to have a family too. That is
why I made a mess last time, Neel said.
I imposed my notion of motherhood on you. Ignored your desire to have a good career
alongside. But forgive me and come with me. I will support you, Debu said.
No, I said, my voice coming from somewhere deep within me.
You are making the right choice with me, Radhika, Neel said.
No, Neel, not with you either.
What? he said.
I checked the time. It was 5.28.
I am not coming with you, or with you. There are fundamental things about both of you that
wont change. Debu, you say you will be supportive, but the fact that you couldnt handle even a bit of
my success means its an intrinsic part of you. You cant change that. And I plan to be a lot more
successful than what you saw. So, sorry, no.
But Radhika. . . Debu began.
I placed a finger on my lips to shush him right there.
And Neel, you are amazing, no doubt. The chartered plane, tempting, of course. Now with the
divorce and everything I know you love me too. But you know what, you love only half of me. My
other half is Kusum, the woman you left. You want a party girl. Someone young, who allows you to
cling on to your youth. The same youth you work so hard in the gym for. Well, I wont be this young
girl forever. I dont know what Neel Gupta will do with me then. He likes Radhika, his young vice
president, but will he like Radhika, the diaper-changing wife and mom?
Of course, I. . .
Shh. I am not going to compromise and settle for less. I have made up my mind. Thank you for
listening. Now, no more lectures. I will simply tell you the action plan.
What? Debu said.
Both of you, I need you to leave, right now. This hotel, Goa and my life. You will not bother
me, my family or my guests. No messages, no calls. You are my past, but guess what, I am done with
my past. So please, I said. I pointed to the exit.
But, Debu said.
I am saying fuck off in the nicest way possible. Please do appreciate that. And do fuck off, I
said.
Debu and Neel looked at each other. They looked at me once more and stood up to leave. In
silence they walked out of the restaurant. Together. Out of my life.
Brijesh entered the coffee shop just as they left. He came up to me. He wore grey workout
clothes. He noticed the used crockery and cutlery on the table.
Good morning, wife-to-be, he said. These people? They came to see you?
Good morning, Brijesh, come. We need to talk, I said. He saw my serious expression and sat
opposite me looking a little baffled.
Yeah sure, he said. By the way, white suits you.
Thanks.
Brijesh ordered a plain dosa and coffee.
Feeling better from last night? Brijesh said after the waiter left.
Sort of.
We always feel more anxious at night, Brijesh said. Dont worry. Remember, whatever
happens in life, eventually it is all going to be okay.
You really believe that? I said.
Yes.
Good. So Brijesh, I thought about it all night. This just doesnt seem right. I cant get married
to you today.
What? he said. Are you serious? Some nervousness is understandable but. . .
I am going to inform my parents now. After that I will talk to your parents.
What?
Unless you can talk to them first. I prefer that. Put the blame on me.
Radhika!
I ignored him and continued, I will settle all bills. Nothing needs to be paid from your
familys side. I am so sorry for this and. . .
Brijesh interrupted me.
Who the hell do you think you are? Brijesh said in an out-of-character high pitch.
I looked at him, surprised.
I am sorry. I can understand you are upset, I said after a pause.
You understand? Thats it? My entire extended family is here. They have celebrated with us
for a week. The morning of the wedding what do I tell them? The bride says no? She has cold feet?
Its all my fault. I accept that.
Everyone is here, Radhika. Everyone.
I know.
The waiter arrived with Brijeshs dosa and coffee. Brijesh left them untouched.
Can I ask why? Brijesh said, his voice under control again.
Tears rolled down my cheeks in response.
Why, Radhika?
Those guys who you saw leave. They are my past. My exes.
He looked back at the restaurant exit.
Its okay. They are gone, I said.
You invited them?
I shook my head. In brief, I told him what had happened to me all of last week in Goa. He
listened with full interest, and had a shocked expression at the end of it.
That is some story, he said as what I had told him sank in.
Yeah, thats my week.
What did you decide finally?
I told them to leave. Get out. Out of Goa and my life, forever.
Good. Then whats the issue? Your past is gone.
But I am not in the present either. I am nowhere, really. I need to find myself.
Find yourself? he said, a bit of sarcasm in his voice. You have told me you had two
relationships. As long as they are in the past, I dont care.
No, Brijesh. This wedding stands cancelled. I am sorry, I said and stood up.
He looked at me. He could see from my expression that I offered no scope for negotiation. He
remained silent. I turned around and left the coffee shop.
M
41
y room in Goa resembled a funeral scene. Despite the five-star luxury and the gold around
my aunts necks, people had a sombre expression. I had communicated my decision. My
mother had displayed her hysteria. Dad sat stone-faced, unable, as usual, to react to any conflict
situation. My aunts had gathered around my mother, offering fake sympathy and condolences. I could
sense their glee. I was providing family gossip for months.
Kamla bua had still not given up.
Brijesh said anything to you? Be honest, Kamla bua said.
I told you several times, he has nothing to do with it. He is quite sweet.
So what is the problem, you mad girl? my mother screeched at the top of her voice.
She came and stood in front of me.
Slap! Before she could deliver another slap Kamla bua held her down. I didnt react.
No, Aparna, no. Keep control. Sai Baba will make it all okay, Kamla bua said to my mother.
What will be okay? We are ruined. Look at her, still glaring at me.
Theres no need to hit me, mom, I said, my face red as I fought back tears.
So what should I do to cure you of your madness? Look at Aditi. In third year of college she
was engaged. Married after a simple graduation.
I am not Aditi.
This is what happens when you educate girls too much, Kamla bua said in a low, consoling
voice.
Its her fathers fault, my mother snapped. He never said no to anything. Ahmedabad, New
York, Hong Kong, wherever she wanted to go, he would let her.
Can you keep dad out of this, mom? I said, my voice muffled. I turned to everyone and folded
my hands.
All of you, I have a request. You are all my extended family. Yes, I take full blame for the
debacle that happened. You can judge me all you want. But can you please not judge my parents for
this?
My aunts and uncles looked at each other.
I continued, Treat it like a Goan holiday. Thats it. My treat. I need your support. My bigger
issue is Brijesh and his family. They will be hurt much more. I need grown-ups from my side to be
with me when I tell them.
Nobody gave me a response.
Fine, I will talk to them on my own. Please enjoy your last day in Goa. Those wanting to fly
out earlier, talk to Suraj to change flights, I said.
The tableau continued. I turned to leave.
Wait, I will come, Aditi didi said. I dont understand what you are doing. But I will come.
Cant let my sister do this by herself.
She stood next to me and held my hand. I smiled at her and held back tears.
I will also come with you, Pankaj mama said. Come, Richa, we cant let her go alone.
Richa mami debated between the roles of obedient wife and offended aunt, and chose the
former.
No need, my mother said. She does everything alone anyway.
Dad, you should come, Aditi didi said. My father stood up.
Come, Aparna, my father said in his soft voice. My mother looked at everyone. With much
reluctance, she stood up.
Yes, lets go. Lets get fully shamed, she said.
I rang the bell. Brijesh opened the door. He didnt say a word and stepped aside to let me and my
relatives enter. The room felt ice-cold, and not because of the air conditioning.
Mr and Mrs Gulati, Brijeshs parents and my almost in-laws-to-be, stood with glum faces.
Brijeshs relatives, his fathers brothers along with their respective wives, sat gingerly on the bed.
Brijeshs mothers sistersRohini masi and Gunjan masisat on the sofa. Everyone looked like they
had had knives stabbed in their backs. Brijesh had already told them.
I struggled to figure out where to start. This is where age helps. For my mother seemed to
know exactly what would be a mature reaction. She burst out crying and went straight to Brijeshs
mother to bear-hug her.
Somebodys cast an evil eye, Sulochana, my mother said. Her lone hysterics made everyone
in the room feel even more awkward. Brijeshs mother didnt hug my mother back.
We are ruined. I had no idea my girl would do this to us. What do you do when your own
child is defective? my mother said, howling at top volume.
Sit down, Aparna ji, Brijeshs father said.
I realized I had to take control. I went to the centre of the room and addressed everyone.
Hello everyone, I will just take a minute. To all in this room, I am sorry. I am really, really,
sorry. I am sorry because I was not prepared for this marriage but I said yes. I am sorry because I
brought shame to your relatives. I am sorry because I ruined your happy moment. However, I did this
because I felt going ahead would not be fair on Brijesh and his family.
This is fair? Brijeshs mother said. Her voice had a sharp sting to it.
No. But going ahead would be even more unfair. Between two unfair things, this felt less
unfair.
I fought back tears as I listened to Brijeshs mother.
In this room it is just us close relatives. You realize what we have to go through with all our
acquaintances who are also here? she said.
I do. I am sorry, I said, tears flowing. I folded my hands. I really am sorry, aunty.
Brijesh looked at his mother and then me. He stood silent with arms crossed on his chest.
You look so good together, my father said. Cant we do something?
I shook my head.
Our relatives are here. The arrangements are all done. We can still end this drama, Radhika,
Brijeshs mother said. Nobody will know. The marriage can still happen.
No, aunty, I am sorry, I said.
What kind of a girl is this? Brijeshs mother said.
I told you. I have a defective piece. My other daughter is golden. Such a nice, good bahu she
is, my mother said.
Enough, Aparna aunty, Brijesh said. Everyone in the room looked at him, surprised. She
may regret her decision to marry me. It doesnt make her defective.
Through my tears I looked at Brijesh. Despite what I had done to him, Mr IT guy could still
actually stand up for me. It only made me feel worse.
And mom, she has made up her mind. We may not like it, but she has, Brijesh said.
But, beta, all arrangements are in place and everyone is here and. . . Brijeshs mother said.
Mom, we cant get married just because it is convenient, Brijesh said.
I gestured a thanks to Brijesh. He nodded. He handed me a box of tissues to wipe my tears.
His kindness, even at this moment, killed me.
All of you are still our guests, my father said with folded hands. And from my daughters
side, I say sorry.
I could not see my father grovel. I wanted to leave so I could cry freely.
Suraj will help you if you need anything. All your bills will be settled. Thank you, I said and
ran out of Brijeshs room.
The Gulatis and Mehtas checked out of the Goa hotel at noon the next day. Both sets of families
avoided eye contact. Things had indeed changed from the sangeet night two days ago when people
could not take enough group selfies.
The Mumbai flight for the Gulatis left earlier than ours. They took their places inside the bus.
Brijesh, one second, I said, as he put on his backpack to leave the hotel lobby.
Yeah? he said, his voice curt.
Can we talk for two minutes?
Really? Why? he said.
I kept quiet. He took a deep breath.
All right, he said. But not here, in full view of everyone. Meet me on the beach in five.
Thanks for supporting me in front of the elders yesterday, I said.
We walked on the Marriott beach one final time.
I dont like raised voices, or insulting people, especially in public, Brijesh said.
You had every right to insult me too. You can now. We are not even in public.
He looked at me for a second. He shook his head and gave a sad smile.
I guess I never understood women anyway. I thought I did, a little bit. Clearly, I still have a
long way to go, he said.
You understand people and you understand kindness. You are a good guy, Brijesh. I am the
one who is messed up. I need clarity.
Hope you find it. What do you plan to do, anyway?
For now, I will go back to work. Maybe apply for some visas. Then take a long vacation.
Maybe one of those round-the-world tickets. The ones that let you fly in one direction. Just keep
going.
Well, the world is round. So you cant keep going. You will eventually have to come back
home. Come back to reality.
Thats true, unfortunately, I said.
Bye then, Brijesh said.
Bye, Brijesh.
You arent coming back to the hotel? he said as he turned to leave.
I will. I just want to watch these waves for a few more minutes, I said and looked into the
horizon.

Three months later
El Albergue Hotel,
IOllantaytambo, Peru
sat in the café and sipped my coffee. The tiny blue trains to Machu Pichu came and went at
regular intervals. I downloaded my trip photos from my phone into my laptop as a backup. My
laptop flashed the date, 23 March, with a reminder saying Message B. It had been three months
since the Goa fiasco. Despite the reminder I found it difficult to gather the courage to message him. I
flipped through every picture from my trip to distract myself.
In the past month, I had started eastwards from London. I visited Berlin, Cairo, Beijing and
Sydney before taking a flight to Lima in Peru, South America. From Lima I landed up in
Ollantaytambo, or simply Ollantay, the base point to visit the famous ruins of Machu Pichu. I stayed at
the historic and charming El Albergue hotel, located right at the mini train station that one uses to visit
Machu Pichu.
One hour and two cappuccinos later, I took out my phone.
Radhika, just do it. Whats the worst that will happen?
I sent a WhatsApp message to Brijesh.
Hi.
I waited for another half an hour, until the blue ticks appeared. He had read my message. He
didnt respond. My heart sank. This was all a bad idea anyway.
Hi. Wassup? he typed back a few minutes later.
Today would have been three months. Of our almost wedding anniversary, I replied.
He sent a smiley.
Sorry again, I replied.
Hey, all part of life. How are you doing?
Good. Travelling. Took that trip I told you about.
Round the world?
Yes.
Reached full circle yet?
Almost. I still have two more flights to go.
Cool. Where are you now?
Peru. Came to see Machu Pichu.
Nice.
Where are you right now? I said.
At work. No such luck like you!
Brijesh, I wanted to ask you something.
Sure.
My next stop is San Francisco. I am there in three days.
Oh, cool.
Yeah. Was wondering if you want to meet for a coffee?
He didnt respond for a few minutes. I had a sinking feeling about this. I sent him another
message anyway.
I totally understand if you cant or if you dont want to.
Sorry, my boss had called me. Yeah sure, would love to have coffee.
Really? Great.
Yeah, can we do it in Menlo Park? Easier for me.
Of course. Whatever is closest to your office. Hows Wednesday?
Sure, Philz Coffee at Menlo Park. 4 p.m.
Philz Coffee
Menlo Park
I arrived five minutes early. Philz Coffee is located just outside the sprawling Facebook campus. I
took a seat by the window, looking at the offices of a company that connected a billion and a half
people around the world. I wore a blue-and-white checked dress, which seemed to reflect the
Californian sunshine.
Hi, Brijesh said as he came up to my table. I stood up. We hugged cursorily.
Thanks for meeting me, I said, a little self-conscious.
No issues. Welcome to my city, he said. He wore a black hoodie and blue jeans. His
shoulders seemed broader, as if he had bulked up. He wore a Facebook corporate ID badge around
his neck.
Strange to see you like this, at work, I said.
Yeah, without any relatives. I see you and feel an aunt is going to pop in any minute, he said.
Totally. I am like, where are the buas and the masis? I said.
Yeah, I feel this urge to touch someones feet, he said.
Both of us laughed.
He went up to the counter and came back with two cappuccinos. I spoke after he sat down.
I can never apologize enough, but again, sorry, I said, The one Indian girl whom you finally
came down to marry created such a drama.
He waved his hand.
You dont need to anymore. I am mostly over it. Life goes on. I reflected in the past three
months too. On why you did what you did, and said no to the wedding that morning.
What did you infer?
That frankly you, or for that matter, any girl, doesnt need a man to define her. You need a man
to support, inspire. . .understand you. Help you be the best person you can be, banker, mother, both,
whatever. And until you find a man you trust enough to do that, why settle?
I looked at Brijesh, admiring his wisdom.
You think so? I said.
I do. And you are not just one Indian girl. You are one special Indian girl.
I smiled and gestured a thanks to him. He nodded.
I still blame myself. A lot. For making you look bad in front of your relatives.
Dont. I dont even think about my relatives when I think about Goa, actually.
Thats good. No regrets? I said.
Not really. Okay, just one regret.
What?
You remember that night at the police station?
Oh yes. When we went to Anjuna? That inspector. Our parents rescuing us. Terrible.
Yeah. And all that we did, the grass, driving without a licenceI would have never done all
that without you.
Well, I am bad company. That was a mad, crazy night.
Yeah, so the thing is, I had begun to look forward to a mad, crazy life with you. That didnt
happen so, oh well. . .Thats the regret. He shrugged and smiled.
Our eyes met. I didnt have a suitable response for him. I decided to change the topic instead.
Your shoulders. You look fitter, I said.
I joined a gym. Try to go every day.
Its showing.
Thanks. You look relaxed too. Your face seems. . .clearer. More peaceful.
So is my mind. A month of travel helps calm you down.
Yeah, Im sure. You look nice, he said.
I smiled. We sipped our coffee.
How is work? I said.
Good. But my business idea is taking shape. A service provider for developing Internet of
Things or IoT apps. IoT is the next big thing. A company that helps make IoT apps has scope.
Of course it does.
Just that I need this formal business plan to raise money from VCs. It is a pain. They want
financial models and projections and what not.
I could help if you want, I said.
Really?
Its what I do on a daily basis, I said and smiled.
Oh yeah, of course.
I will need to understand the business. And turn it into a spreadsheet full of numbers. I do it
all the time.
I will share the details with you. How long are you here for?
I have five more days of vacation left. I could make a quick model in the next couple of days.
You would? That would be amazing. Can we work on it over the weekend?
No problem, I said.
We sipped our coffee in silence for a minute before he spoke again. Also, if you are here this
weekend, theres an Arijit Singh concert.
Oh cool. I like him, I said. He had simply informed me about the concert. I couldnt assume
he had asked me to go to it with him.
Yeah, so, he said and took another sip of his coffee. A sliver of foam stuck above his lips.
I pointed to his lip.
What? he said.
I opened the camera on my phone and turned it into selfie mode. I showed him his face and
smiled.
Oh no, he said, embarrassed. He wiped his foam moustache with a tissue.
I gathered the courage to ask him a question.
Brijesh, would you like to come to the Arijit Singh concert with me? I said, my heart beating
fast. I had to be prepared for any response, including a bitter, biting rejection.
Of course, that is what I meant. You will be helping me with the business, so we could go
together to the concert later, right? he said.
I would love that. To go to the concert with you, I said.
Yeah, I would love to spend more time with you too.
Our eyes met again, this time for longer. He took another sip of his coffee. It created an even
bigger foam moustache. He also had some foam stuck to the tip of his nose. I showed him his face in
my phones camera again. He smiled. I smiled. We looked at each other for a few seconds. Then we
laughed. And then we laughed some more.

ON THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND ANIMALS.




INTRODUCTION.

MANY works have been written on Expression, but a greater number on
Physiognomy,--that is, on the recognition of character through the study
of the permanent form of the features. With this latter subject I am
not here concerned. The older treatises,[1] which I have consulted, have
been of little or no service to me. The famous 'Conferences'[2] of the
painter Le Brun, published in 1667, is the best known ancient work,
and contains some good remarks. Another somewhat old essay, namely,
the 'Discours,' delivered 1774-1782, by the well-known Dutch anatomist
Camper,[3] can hardly be considered as having made any marked advance in
the subject. The following works, on the contrary, deserve the fullest
consideration.

Sir Charles Bell, so illustrious for his discoveries in physiology,
published in 1806 the first edition, and in the third edition of his
'Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression.'[4] He may with justice be said,
not only to have laid the foundations of the subject as a branch of
science, but to have built up a noble structure. His work is in every
way deeply interesting; it includes graphic descriptions of the various
emotions, and is admirably illustrated. It is generally admitted that
his service consists chiefly in having shown the intimate relation which
exists between the movements of expression and those of respiration. One
of the most important points, small as it may at first appear, is that
the muscles round the eyes are involuntarily contracted during violent
expiratory efforts, in order to protect these delicate organs from the
pressure of the blood. This fact, which has been fully investigated for
me with the greatest kindness by Professors Donders of Utrecht, throws,
as we shall hereafter see, a flood of light on several of the most
important expressions of the human countenance. The merits of Sir C.
Bell's work have been undervalued or quite ignored by several foreign
writers, but have been fully admitted by some, for instance by M.
Lemoine,[5] who with great justice says:--"Le livre de Ch. Bell devrait
etre medite par quiconque essaye de faire parler le visage de l'homme,
par les philosophes aussi bien que par les artistes, car, sous une
apparence plus legere et sous le pretexte de l'esthetique, c'est un
des plus beaux monuments de la science des rapports du physique et du
moral."

From reasons which will presently be assigned, Sir C. Bell did not
attempt to follow out his views as far as they might have been carried.
He does not try to explain why different muscles are brought into action
under different emotions; why, for instance, the inner ends of the
eyebrows are raised, and the corners of the mouth depressed, by a person
suffering from grief or anxiety.

In 1807 M. Moreau edited an edition of Lavater on Physiognomy,[6] in
which he incorporated several of his own essays, containing excellent
descriptions of the movements of the facial muscles, together with
many valuable remarks. He throws, however, very little light on the
philosophy of the subject. For instance, M. Moreau, in speaking of the
act of frowning, that is, of the contraction of the muscle called by
French writers the _soucilier_ (_corrigator supercilii_), remarks with
truth:--"Cette action des sourciliers est un des symptomes les plus
tranches de l'expression des affections penibles ou concentrees." He
then adds that these muscles, from their attachment and position, are
fitted "a resserrer, a concentrer les principaux traits de la _face_,
comme il convient dans toutes ces passions vraiment oppressives
ou profondes, dans ces affections dont le sentiment semble porter
l'organisation a revenir sur elle-meme, a se contracter et a
_s'amoindrir_, comme pour offrir moins de prise et de surface a des
impressions redoutables ou importunes." He who thinks that remarks of
this kind throw any light on the meaning or origin of the different
expressions, takes a very different view of the subject to what I do.

The earliest edition of this work, referred to in the preface to the
edition of 1820 in ten volumes, as containing the observations of M.
Moreau, is said to have been published in 1807; and I have no doubt that
this is correct, because the 'Notice sur Lavater' at the commencement
of volume i. is dated April 13, 1806. In some bibliographical works,
however, the date of 1805--1809 is given, but it seems impossible that
1805 can be correct. Dr. Duchenne remarks ('Mecanisme de la Physionomie
Humaine,'-8vo edit. 1862, p. 5, and 'Archives Generales de Medecine,'
Jan. et Fev. 1862) that M. Moreau "_a compose pour son ouvrage un
article important_," &c., in the year 1805; and I find in volume i. of
the edition of 1820 passages bearing the dates of December 12, 1805, and
another January 5, 1806, besides that of April 13, 1806, above referred
to. In consequence of some of these passages having thus been COMPOSED
in 1805, Dr. Duchenne assigns to M. Moreau the priority over Sir C.
Bell, whose work, as we have seen, was published in 1806. This is a very
unusual manner of determining the priority of scientific works; but such
questions are of extremely little importance in comparison with their
relative merits. The passages above quoted from M. Moreau and from Le
Brun are taken in this and all other cases from the edition of 1820 of
Lavater, tom. iv. p. 228, and tom. ix. p. 279. In the above passage
there is but a slight, if any, advance in the philosophy of the subject,
beyond that reached by the painter Le Brun, who, in 1667, in describing
the expression of fright, says:--"Le sourcil qui est abaisse d'un cote
et eleve de l'autre, fait voir que la partie elevee semble le vouloir
joindre au cerveau pour le garantir du mal que l'ame apercoit, et le
cote qui est abaisse et qui parait enfle,--nous fait trouver dans cet
etat par les esprits qui viennent du cerveau en abondance, comme polir
couvrir l'aine et la defendre du mal qu'elle craint; la bouche fort
ouverte fait voir le saisissement du coeur, par le sang qui se retire
vers lui, ce qui l'oblige, voulant respirer, a faire un effort qui est
cause que la bouche s'ouvre extremement, et qui, lorsqu'il passe par les
organes de la voix, forme un son qui n'est point articule; que si les
muscles et les veines paraissent enfles, ce n'est que par les esprits
que le cerveau envoie en ces parties-la." I have thought the foregoing
sentences worth quoting, as specimens of the surprising nonsense which
has been written on the subject.

'The Physiology or Mechanism of Blushing,' by Dr. Burgess, appeared
in 1839, and to this work I shall frequently refer in my thirteenth
Chapter.

In 1862 Dr. Duchenne published two editions, in folio and octavo, of his
'Mecanisme de la Physionomie Humaine,' in which he analyses by means of
electricity, and illustrates by magnificent photographs, the movements
of the facial muscles. He has generously permitted me to copy as many of
his photographs as I desired. His works have been spoken lightly of, or
quite passed over, by some of his countrymen. It is possible that Dr.
Duchenne may have exaggerated the importance of the contraction of
single muscles in giving expression; for, owing to the intimate manner
in which the muscles are connected, as may be seen in Henle's anatomical
drawings[7]--the best I believe ever published it is difficult to
believe in their separate action. Nevertheless, it is manifest that Dr.
Duchenne clearly apprehended this and other sources of error, and as it
is known that he was eminently successful in elucidating the physiology
of the muscles of the hand by the aid of electricity, it is probable
that he is generally in the right about the muscles of the face. In my
opinion, Dr. Duchenne has greatly advanced the subject by his treatment
of it. No one has more carefully studied the contraction of each
separate muscle, and the consequent furrows produced on the skin. He
has also, and this is a very important service, shown which muscles are
least under the separate control of the will. He enters very little into
theoretical considerations, and seldom attempts to explain why certain
muscles and not others contract under the influence of certain emotions.
A distinguished French anatomist, Pierre Gratiolet, gave a course of
lectures on Expression at the Sorbonne, and his notes were published
(1865) after his death, under the title of 'De la Physionomie et des
Mouvements d'Expression.' This is a very interesting work, full of
valuable observations. His theory is rather complex, and, as far as it
can be given in a single sentence (p. 65), is as follows:--"Il resulte,
de tous les faits que j'ai rappeles, que les sens, l'imagination et la
pensee ellememe, si elevee, si abstraite qu'on la suppose, ne peuvent
s'exercer sans eveiller un sentiment correlatif, et que ce sentiment
se traduit directement, sympathiquement, symboliquement ou
metaphoriquement, dans toutes les spheres des organs exterieurs, qui la
racontent tous, suivant leur mode d'action propre, comme si chacun d'eux
avait ete directement affecte."

Gratiolet appears to overlook inherited habit, and even to some extent
habit in the individual; and therefore he fails, as it seems to me, to
give the right explanation, or any explanation at all, of many gestures
and expressions. As an illustration of what he calls symbolic movements,
I will quote his remarks (p. 37), taken from M. Chevreul, on a man
playing at billiards. "Si une bille devie legerement de la direction
que le joueur pretend zlui imprimer, ne l'avez-vous pas vu cent fois
la pousser du regard, de la tete et meme des epaules, comme si ces
mouvements, purement symboliques, pouvaient rectifier son trajet? Des
mouvements non moins significatifs se produisent quand la bille manque
d'une impulsion suffisante. Et cliez les joueurs novices, ils sont
quelquefois accuses au point d'eveiller le sourire sur les levres des
spectateurs." Such movements, as it appeirs to me, may be attributed
simply to habit. As often as a man has wished to move an object to one
side, he has always pushed it to that side when forwards, he has pushed
it forwards; and if he has wished to arrest it, he has pulled backwards.
Therefore, when a man sees his ball travelling in a wrong direction, and
he intensely wishes it to go in another direction, he cannot avoid, from
long habit, unconsciously performing movements which in other cases he
has found effectual.

As an instance of sympathetic movements Gratiolet gives (p. 212) the
following case:--"un jeune chien A oreilles droites, auquel son maitre
presente de loin quelque viande appetissante, fixe avec ardeur ses yeux
sur cet objet dont il suit tous les mouvements, et pendant que les yeux
regardent, les deux oreilles se portent en avant comme si cet objet
pouvait etre entendu." Here, instead of speaking of sympathy between
the ears and eyes, it appears to me more simple to believe, that as dogs
during many generations have, whilst intently looking at any object,
pricked their ears in order to perceive any sound; and conversely have
looked intently in the direction of a sound to which they may have
listened, the movements of these organs have become firmly associated
together through long-continued habit.

Dr. Piderit published in 1859 an essay on Expression, which I have not
seen, but in which, as he states, he forestalled Gratiolet in many of
his views. In 1867 he published his 'Wissenschaftliches System der Mimik
und Physiognomik.' It is hardly possible to give in a few sentences a
fair notion of his views; perhaps the two following sentences will tell
as much as can be briefly told: "the muscular movements of expression
are in part related to imaginary objects, and in part to imaginary
sensorial impressions. In this proposition lies the key to the
comprehension of all expressive muscular movements." (s. 25) Again,
"Expressive movements manifest themselves chiefly in the numerous and
mobile muscles of the face, partly because the nerves by which they
are set into motion originate in the most immediate vicinity of the
mind-organ, but partly also because these muscles serve to support the
organs of sense." (s. 26.) If Dr. Piderit had studied Sir C. Bell's
work, he would probably not have said (s. 101) that violent laughter
causes a frown from partaking of the nature of pain; or that with
infants (s. 103) the tears irritate the eyes, and thus excite the
contraction of the surrounding in muscles. Many good remarks are
scattered throughout this volume, to which I shall hereafter refer.

Short discussions on Expression may be found in various works, which
need not here be particularised. Mr. Bain, however, in two of his works
has treated the subject at some length. He says,[8] "I look upon the
expression so-called as part and parcel of the feeling. I believe it to
be a general law of the mind that along with the fact of inward feeling
or consciousness, there is a diffusive action or excitement over the
bodily members." In another place he adds, "A very considerable number
of the facts may be brought under the following principle: namely, that
states of pleasure are connected with an increase, and states of pain
with an abatement, of some, or all, of the vital functions." But the
above law of the diffusive action of feelings seems too general to throw
much light on special expressions.

Mr. Herbert Spencer, in treating of the Feelings in his 'Principles of
Psychology' (1855), makes the following remarks:--"Fear, when strong,
expresses itself in cries, in efforts to hide or escape, in palpitations
and tremblings; and these are just the manifestations that would
accompany an actual experience of the evil feared. The destructive
passions are shown in a general tension of the muscular system, in
gnashing of the teeth and protrusion of the claws, in dilated eyes
and nostrils in growls; and these are weaker forms of the actions that
accompany the killing of prey." Here we have, as I believe, the true
theory of a large number of expressions; but the chief interest and
difficulty of the subject lies in following out the wonderfully complex
results. I infer that some one (but who he is I have not been able to
ascertain) formerly advanced a nearly similar view, for Sir C. Bell
says,[9] "It has been maintained that what are called the external signs
of passion, are only the concomitants of those voluntary movements which
the structure renders necessary." Mr. Spencer has also published[10]
a valuable essay on the physiology of Laughter, in which he insists on
"the general law that feeling passing a certain pitch, habitually
vents itself in bodily action," and that "an overflow of nerve-force
undirected by any motive, will manifestly take first the most habitual
routes; and if these do not suffice, will next overflow into the less
habitual ones." This law I believe to be of the highest importance in
throwing light on our subject.'

All the authors who have written on Expression, with the exception of
Mr. Spencer--the great expounder of the principle of Evolution--appear
to have been firmly convinced that species, man of course included,
came into existence in their present condition. Sir C. Bell, being
thus convinced, maintains that many of our facial muscles are "purely
instrumental in expression;" or are "a special provision" for this sole
object.[12] But the simple fact that the anthropoid apes possess the
same facial muscles as we do,[13] renders it very improbable that these
muscles in our case serve exclusively for expression; for no one, I
presume, would be inclined to admit that monkeys have been endowed with
special muscles solely for exhibiting their hideous grimaces. Distinct
uses, independently of expression, can indeed be assigned with much
probability for almost all the facial muscles.

Sir C. Bell evidently wished to draw as broad a distinction as possible
between man and the lower animals; and he consequently asserts that with
"the lower creatures there is no expression but what may be referred,
more or less plainly, to their acts of volition or necessary instincts."
He further maintains that their faces "seem chiefly capable of
expressing rage and fear."[14] But man himself cannot express love and
humility by external signs, so plainly as does a dog, when with drooping
ears, hanging lips, flexuous body, and wagging tail, he meets his
beloved master. Nor can these movements in the dog be explained by acts
of volition or necessary instincts, any more than the beaming eyes and
smiling cheeks of a man when he meets an old friend. If Sir C. Bell had
been questioned about the expression of affection in the dog, he would
no doubt have answered that this animal had been created with special
instincts, adapting him for association with man, and that all further
enquiry on the subject was superfluous.

Although Gratiolet emphatically denies[15] that any muscle has been
developed solely for the sake of expression, he seems never to have
reflected on the principle of evolution. He apparently looks at each
species as a separate creation. So it is with the other writers on
Expression. For instance, Dr. Duchenne, after speaking of the movements
of the limbs, refers to those which give expression to the face, and
remarks:[16] "Le createur n'a donc pas eu a se preoccuper ici des
besoins de la mecanique; il a pu, selon sa sagesse, ou--que l'on me
pardonne cette maniere de parler--par une divine fantaisie, mettre
en action tel ou tel muscle, un seul ou plusieurs muscles a la fois,
lorsqu'il a voulu que les signes caracteristiques des passions, meme les
plus fugaces, lussent ecrits passagerement sur la face de l'homme. Ce
langage de la physionomie une fois cree, il lui a suffi, pour le
rendre universel et immuable, de donner a tout etre humain la faculte
instinctive d'exprimer toujours ses sendments par la contraction des
memes muscles."

Many writers consider the whole subject of Expression as inexplicable.
Thus the illustrious physiologist Muller, says,[17] "The completely
different expression of the features in different passions shows that,
according to the kind of feeling excited, entirely different groups of
the fibres of the facial nerve are acted on. Of the cause of this we are
quite ignorant."

No doubt as long as man and all other animals are viewed as independent
creations, an effectual stop is put to our natural desire to investigate
as far as possible the causes of Expression. By this doctrine, anything
and everything can be equally well explained; and it has proved as
pernicious with respect to Expression as to every other branch of
natural history. With mankind some expressions, such as the bristling of
the hair under the influence of extreme terror, or the uncovering of the
teeth under that of furious rage, can hardly be understood, except
on the belief that man once existed in a much lower and animal-like
condition. The community of certain expressions in distinct though
allied species, as in the movements of the same facial muscles during
laughter by man and by various monkeys, is rendered somewhat more
intelligible, if we believe in their descent from a common progenitor.
He who admits on general grounds that the structure and habits of all
animals have been gradually evolved, will look at the whole subject of
Expression in a new and interesting light.

The study of Expression is difficult, owing to the movements being often
extremely slight, and of a fleeting nature. A difference may be clearly
perceived, and yet it may be impossible, at least I have found it so, to
state in what the difference consists. When we witness any deep emotion,
our sympathy is so strongly excited, that close observation is forgotten
or rendered almost impossible; of which fact I have had many curious
proofs. Our imagination is another and still more serious source of
error; for if from the nature of the circumstances we expect to see
any expression, we readily imagine its presence. Notwithstanding Dr.
Duchenne's great experience, he for a long time fancied, as he states,
that several muscles contracted under certain emotions, whereas he
ultimately convinced himself that the movement was confined to a single
muscle.

In order to acquire as good a foundation as possible, and to ascertain,
independently of common opinion, how far particular movements of the
features and gestures are really expressive of certain states of the
mind, I have found the following means the most serviceable. In the
first place, to observe infants; for they exhibit many emotions, as Sir
C. Bell remarks, "with extraordinary force;" whereas, in after life,
some of our expressions "cease to have the pure and simple source from
which they spring in infancy."[18]

In the second place, it occurred to me that the insane ought to
be studied, as they are liable to the strongest passions, and give
uncontrolled vent to them. I had, myself, no opportunity of doing this,
so I applied to Dr. Maudsley and received from him an introduction
to Dr. J. Crichton Browne, who has charge of an immense asylum near
Wakefield, and who, as I found, had already attended to the subject.
This excellent observer has with unwearied kindness sent me copious
notes and descriptions, with valuable suggestions on many points; and I
can hardly over-estimate the value of his assistance. I owe also, to the
kindness of Mr. Patrick Nicol, of the Sussex Lunatic Asylum, interesting
statements on two or three points.

Thirdly Dr. Duchenne galvanized, as we have already seen, certain
muscles in the face of an old man, whose skin was little sensitive, and
thus produced various expressions which were photographed on a large
scale. It fortunately occurred to me to show several of the best plates,
without a word of explanation, to above twenty educated persons of
various ages and both sexes, asking them, in each case, by what emotion
or feeling the old man was supposed to be agitated; and I recorded their
answers in the words which they used. Several of the expressions were
instantly recognised by almost everyone, though described in not exactly
the same terms; and these may, I think, be relied on as truthful,
and will hereafter be specified. On the other hand, the most widely
different judgments were pronounced in regard to some of them. This
exhibition was of use in another way, by convincing me how easily we
may be misguided by our imagination; for when I first looked through
Dr. Duchenne's photographs, reading at the same time the text, and
thus learning what was intended, I was struck with admiration at the
truthfulness of all, with only a few exceptions. Nevertheless, if I had
examined them without any explanation, no doubt I should have been as
much perplexed, in some cases, as other persons have been.

Fourthly, I had hoped to derive much aid from the great masters in
painting and sculpture, who are such close observers. Accordingly, I
have looked at photographs and engravings of many well-known works; but,
with a few exceptions, have not thus profited. The reason no doubt
is, that in works of art, beauty is the chief object; and strongly
contracted facial muscles destroy beauty.[19] The story of the
composition is generally told with wonderful force and truth by
skilfully given accessories.

Fifthly, it seemed to me highly important to ascertain whether the same
expressions and gestures prevail, as has often been asserted without
much evidence, with all the races of mankind, especially with those who
have associated but little with Europeans. Whenever the same movements
of the features or body express the same emotions in several distinct
races of man, we may infer with much probability, that such expressions
are true ones,--that is, are innate or instinctive. Conventional
expressions or gestures, acquired by the individual during early life,
would probably have differed in the different races, in the same manner
as do their languages. Accordingly I circulated, early in the year
1867, the following printed queries with a request, which has been
fully responded to, that actual observations, and not memory, might be
trusted. These queries were written after a considerable interval of
time, during which my attention had been otherwise directed, and I can
now see that they might have been greatly improved. To some of the later
copies, I appended, in manuscript, a few additional remarks:--

(1.) Is astonishment expressed by the eyes and mouth being opened wide,
and by the eyebrows being raised?

(2.) Does shame excite a blush when the colour of the skin allows it to
be visible? and especially how low down the body does the blush extend?

(3.) When a man is indignant or defiant does he frown, hold his body and
head erect, square his shoulders and clench his fists?

(4) When considering deeply on any subject, or trying to understand any
puzzle, does he frown, or wrinkle the skin beneath the lower eyelids?

(5.) When in low spirits, are the corners of the mouth depressed, and
the inner corner of the eyebrows raised by that muscle which the French
call the "Grief muscle"? The eyebrow in this state becomes slightly
oblique, with a little swelling at the Inner end; and the forehead
is transversely wrinkled in the middle part, but not across the whole
breadth, as when the eyebrows are raised in surprise. (6.) When in good
spirits do the eyes sparkle, with the skin a little wrinkled round and
under them, and with the mouth a little drawn back at the corners?

(7.) When a man sneers or snarls at another, is the corner of the upper
lip over the canine or eye tooth raised on the side facing the man whom
he addresses?

(8) Can a dogged or obstinate expression be recognized, which is chiefly
shown by the mouth being firmly closed, a lowering brow and a slight
frown?

(9.) Is contempt expressed by a slight protrusion of the lips and by
turning up the nose, and with a slight expiration?

(10) Is disgust shown by the lower lip being turned down, the upper
lip slightly raised, with a sudden expiration, something like incipient
vomiting, or like something spit out of the mouth?

(11.) Is extreme fear expressed in the same general manner as with
Europeans?

(12.) Is laughter ever carried to such an extreme as to bring tears into
the eyes?

(13.) When a man wishes to show that he cannot prevent something being
done, or cannot himself do something, does he shrug his shoulders, turn
inwards his elbows, extend outwards his hands and open the palms; with
the eyebrows raised?

(14) Do the children when sulky, pout or greatly protrude the lips?

(15.) Can guilty, or sly, or jealous expressions be recognized? though I
know not how these can be defined.

(16.) Is the head nodded vertically in affirmation, and shaken laterally
in negation?


Observations on natives who have had little communication with Europeans
would be of course the most valuable, though those made on any natives
would be of much interest to me. General remarks on expression are of
comparatively little value; and memory is so deceptive that I earnestly
beg it may not be trusted. A definite description of the countenance
under any emotion or frame of mind, with a statement of the
circumstances under which it occurred, would possess much value.

To these queries I have received thirty-six answers from different
observers, several of them missionaries or protectors of the aborigines,
to all of whom I am deeply indebted for the great trouble which they
have taken, and for the valuable aid thus received. I will specify their
names, &c., towards the close of this chapter, so as not to interrupt my
present remarks. The answers relate to several of the most distinct
and savage races of man. In many instances, the circumstances have been
recorded under which each expression was observed, and the expression
itself described. In such cases, much confidence may be placed in the
answers. When the answers have been simply yes or no, I have always
received them with caution. It follows, from the information thus
acquired, that the same state of mind is expressed throughout the world
with remarkable uniformity; and this fact is in itself interesting
as evidence of the close similarity in bodily structure and mental
disposition of all the races, of mankind.

Sixthly, and lastly, I have attended as closely as I could, to the
expression of the several passions in some of the commoner animals; and
this I believe to be of paramount importance, not of course for deciding
how far in man certain expressions are characteristic of certain states
of mind, but as affording the safest basis for generalisation on the
causes, or origin, of the various movements of Expression. In observing
animals, we are not so likely to be biassed by our imagination; and we
may feel safe that their expressions are not conventional.

From the reasons above assigned, namely, the fleeting nature of some
expressions (the changes in the features being often extremely slight);
our sympathy being easily aroused when we behold any strong emotion,
and our attention thus distracted; our imagination deceiving us, from
knowing in a vague manner what to expect, though certainly few of us
know what the exact changes in the countenance are; and lastly, even our
long familiarity with the subject,--from all these causes combined, the
observation of Expression is by no means easy, as many persons, whom I
have asked to observe certain points, have soon discovered. Hence it is
difficult to determine, with certainty, what are the movements of the
features and of the body, which commonly characterize certain states of
the mind. Nevertheless, some of the doubts and difficulties have, as
I hope, been cleared away by the observation of infants,--of the
insane,--of the different races of man,--of works of art,--and lastly,
of the facial muscles under the action of galvanism, as effected by Dr.
Duchenne.

But there remains the much greater difficulty of understanding the
cause or origin of the several expressions, and of judging whether any
theoretical explanation is trustworthy. Besides, judging as well as we
can by our reason, without the aid of any rules, which of two or more
explanations is the most satisfactory, or are quite unsatisfactory, I
see only one way of testing our conclusions. This is to observe whether
the same principle by which one expression can, as it appears, be
explained, is applicable in other allied cases; and especially, whether
the same general principles can be applied with satisfactory results,
both to man and the lower animals. This latter method, I am inclined to
think, is the most serviceable of all. The difficulty of judging of the
truth of any theoretical explanation, and of testing it by some distinct
line of investigation, is the great drawback to that interest which the
study seems well fitted to excite.

Finally, with respect to my own observations, I may state that they were
commenced in the year 1838; and from that time to the present day, I
have occasionally attended to the subject. At the above date, I was
already inclined to believe in the principle of evolution, or of the
derivation of species from other and lower forms. Consequently, when I
read Sir C. Bell's great work, his view, that man had been created with
certain muscles specially adapted for the expression of his feelings,
struck me as unsatisfactory. It seemed probable that the habit of
expressing our feelings by certain movements, though now rendered
innate, had been in some manner gradually acquired. But to discover how
such habits had been acquired was perplexing in no small degree. The
whole subject had to be viewed under a new aspect, and each expression
demanded a rational explanation. This belief led me to attempt the
present work, however imperfectly it may have been executed.--------

I will now give the names of the gentlemen to whom, as I have said, I am
deeply indebted for information in regard to the expressions exhibited
by various races of man, and I will specify some of the circumstances
under which the observations were in each case made. Owing to the great
kindness and powerful influence of Mr. Wilson, of Hayes Place, Kent, I
have received from Australia no less than thirteen sets of answers to
my queries. This has been particularly fortunate, as the Australian
aborigines rank amongst the most distinct of all the races of man. It
will be seen that the observations have been chiefly made in the south,
in the outlying parts of the colony of Victoria; but some excellent
answers have been received from the north.

Mr. Dyson Lacy has given me in detail some valuable observations, made
several hundred miles in the interior of Queensland. To Mr. R. Brough
Smyth, of Melbourne, I am much indebted for observations made
by himself, and for sending me several of the following letters,
namely:--From the Rev. Mr. Hagenauer, of Lake Wellington, a missionary
in Gippsland, Victoria, who has had much experience with the natives.
From Mr. Samuel Wilson, a landowner, residing at Langerenong, Wimmera,
Victoria. From the Rev. George Taplin, superintendent of the native
Industrial Settlement at Port Macleay. From Mr. Archibald G. Lang, of
Coranderik, Victoria, a teacher at a school where aborigines, old and
young, are collected from all parts of the colony. From Mr. H. B.
Lane, of Belfast, Victoria, a police magistrate and warden, whose
observations, as I am assured, are highly trustworthy. From Mr.
Templeton Bunnett, of Echuca, whose station is on the borders of
the colony of Victoria, and who has thus been able to observe many
aborigines who have had little intercourse with white men. He compared
his observations with those made by two other gentlemen long resident
in the neighbourhood. Also from Mr. J. Bulmer, a missionary in a remote
part of Gippsland, Victoria.

I am also indebted to the distinguished botanist, Dr. Ferdinand Muller,
of Victoria, for some observations made by himself, and for sending me
others made by Mrs. Green, as well as for some of the foregoing letters.

In regard to the Maoris of New Zealand, the Rev. J. W. Stack has
answered only a few of my queries; but the answers have been remarkably
full, clear, and distinct, with the circumstances recorded under which
the observations were made.

The Rajah Brooke has given me some information with respect to the Dyaks
of Borneo.

Respecting the Malays, I have been highly successful; for Mr. F. Geach
(to whom I was introduced by Mr. Wallace), during his residence as a
mining engineer in the interior of Malacca, observed many natives, who
had never before associated with white men. He wrote me two long
letters with admirable and detailed observations on their expression. He
likewise observed the Chinese immigrants in the Malay archipelago.

The well-known naturalist, H. M. Consul, Mr. Swinhoe, also observed
for me the Chinese in their native country; and he made inquiries from
others whom he could trust.

In India Mr. H. Erskine, whilst residing in his official capacity in the
Admednugur District in the Bombay Presidency, attended to the expression
of the inhabitants, but found much difficulty in arriving at any safe
conclusions, owing to their habitual concealment of all emotions in
the presence of Europeans. He also obtained information for me from
Mr. West, the Judge in Canara, and he consulted some intelligent native
gentlemen on certain points. In Calcutta Mr. J. Scott, curator of the
Botanic Gardens, carefully observed the various tribes of men therein
employed during a considerable period, and no one has sent me such full
and valuable details. The habit of accurate observation, gained by his
botanical studies, has been brought to bear on our present subject. For
Ceylon I am much indebted to the Rev. S. O. Glenie for answers to some
of my queries.

Turning to Africa, I have been unfortunate with respect to the negroes,
though Mr. Winwood Reade aided me as far as lay in his power. It would
have been comparatively easy to have obtained information in regard to
the negro slaves in America; but as they have long associated with
white men, such observations would have possessed little value. In the
southern parts of the continent Mrs. Barber observed the Kafirs and
Fingoes, and sent me many distinct answers. Mr. J. P. Mansel Weale also
made some observations on the natives, and procured for me a curious
document, namely, the opinion, written in English, of Christian
Gaika, brother of the Chief Sandilli, on the expressions of his
fellow-countrymen. In the northern regions of Africa Captain Speedy,
who long resided with the Abyssinians, answered my queries partly from
memory and partly from observations made on the son of King Theodore,
who was then under his charge. Professor and Mrs. Asa Gray attended
to some points in the expressions of the natives, as observed by them
whilst ascending the Nile.

On the great American continent Mr. Bridges, a catechist residing
with the Fuegians, answered some few questions about their expression,
addressed to him many years ago. In the northern half of the continent
Dr. Rothrock attended to the expressions of the wild Atnah and Espyox
tribes on the Nasse River, in North-Western America. Mr. Washington
Matthews Assistant-Surgeon in the United States Army, also observed
with special care (after having seen my queries, as printed in the
'Smithsonian Report') some of the wildest tribes in the Western parts
of the United States, namely, the Tetons, Grosventres, Mandans, and
Assinaboines; and his answers have proved of the highest value.

Lastly, besides these special sources of information, I have collected
some few facts incidentally given in books of travels.----

[Illustration: Muscles of the human face. Fig 1-2]

[Illustration: Muscles of the human face. Fig 3]

As I shall often have to refer, more especially in the latter part of
this volume, to the muscles of the human face, I have had a diagram
(fig. 1) copied and reduced from Sir C. Bell's work, and two others,
with more accurate details (figs. 2 and 3), from Herde's well-known
'Handbuch der Systematischen Anatomie des Menschen.' The same letters
refer to the same muscles in all three figures, but the names are given
of only the more important ones to which I shall have to allude. The
facial muscles blend much together, and, as I am informed, hardly appear
on a dissected face so distinct as they are here represented. Some
writers consider that these muscles consist of nineteen pairs, with one
unpaired;[20] but others make the number much larger, amounting even to
fifty-five, according to Moreau. They are, as is admitted by everyone
who has written on the subject, very variable in structure; and Moreau
remarks that they are hardly alike in half-a-dozen subjects.[21] They
are also variable in function. Thus the power of uncovering the canine
tooth on one side differs much in different persons. The power of
raising the wings of the nostrils is also, according to Dr. Piderit,[22]
variable in a remarkable degree; and other such cases could be given.

Finally, I must have the pleasure of expressing my obligations to Mr.
Rejlander for the trouble which he has taken in photographing for me
various expressions and gestures. I am also indebted to Herr Kindermann,
of Hamburg, for the loan of some excellent negatives of crying infants;
and to Dr. Wallich for a charming one of a smiling girl. I have already
expressed my obligations to Dr. Duchenne for generously permitting me
to have some of his large photographs copied and reduced. All these
photographs have been printed by the Heliotype process, and the accuracy
of the copy is thus guaranteed. These plates are referred to by Roman
numerals.

I am also greatly indebted to Mr. T. W. Wood for the extreme pains which
he has taken in drawing from life the expressions of various animals. A
distinguished artist, Mr. Riviere, has had the kindness to give me
two drawings of dogs--one in a hostile and the other in a humble and
caressing frame of mind. Mr. A. May has also given me two similar
sketches of dogs. Mr. Cooper has taken much care in cutting the blocks.
Some of the photographs and drawings, namely, those by Mr. May, and
those by Mr. Wolf of the Cynopithecus, were first reproduced by Mr.
Cooper on wood by means of photography, and then engraved: by this means
almost complete fidelity is ensured.



CHAPTER I. -- GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EXPRESSION.

The three chief principles stated--The first principle--Serviceable
actions become habitual in association with certain states of the mind,
and are performed whether or not of service in each particular
case--The force of habit--Inheritance--Associated habitual movements in
man--Reflex actions--Passage of habits into reflex actions--Associated
habitual movements in the lower animals--Concluding remarks.


I WILL begin by giving the three Principles, which appear to me to
account for most of the expressions and gestures involuntarily used by
man and the lower animals, under the influence of various emotions and
sensations.[101] I arrived, however, at these three Principles only at
the close of my observations. They will be discussed in the present and
two following chapters in a general manner. Facts observed both with man
and the lower animals will here be made use of; but the latter facts
are preferable, as less likely to deceive us. In the fourth and fifth
chapters, I will describe the special expressions of some of the lower
animals; and in the succeeding chapters those of man. Everyone will thus
be able to judge for himself, how far my three principles throw light on
the theory of the subject. It appears to me that so many expressions are
thus explained in a fairly satisfactory manner, that probably all will
hereafter be found to come under the same or closely analogous heads.
I need hardly premise that movements or changes in any part of the
body,--as the wagging of a dog's tail, the drawing back of a horse's
ears, the shrugging of a man's shoulders, or the dilatation of
the capillary vessels of the skin,--may all equally well serve for
expression. The three Principles are as follows.

I. _The principle of serviceable associated Habits_.--Certain complex
actions are of direct or indirect service under certain states of the
mind, in order to relieve or gratify certain sensations, desires, &c.;
and whenever the same state of mind is induced, however feebly, there
is a tendency through the force of habit and association for the same
movements to be performed, though they may not then be of the least use.
Some actions ordinarily associated through habit with certain states of
the mind may be partially repressed through the will, and in such cases
the muscles which are least under the separate control of the will are
the most liable still to act, causing movements which we recognize as
expressive. In certain other cases the checking of one habitual movement
requires other slight movements; and these are likewise expressive.

II. _The principle of Antithesis_.--Certain states of the mind lead
to certain habitual actions, which are of service, as under our first
principle. Now when a directly opposite state of mind is induced, there
is a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance of movements
of a directly opposite nature, though these are of no use; and such
movements are in some cases highly expressive.

III. _The principle of actions due to the constitution of the Nervous
System, independently from the first of the Will, and independently to
a certain extent of Habit_.--When the sensorium is strongly excited,
nerve-force is generated in excess, and is transmitted in certain
definite directions, depending on the connection of the nerve-cells,
and partly on habit: or the supply of nerve-force may, as it appears, be
interrupted. Effects are thus produced which we recognize as expressive.
This third principle may, for the sake of brevity, be called that of the
direct action of the nervous system.


With respect to our _first Principle_, it is notorious how powerful is
the force of habit. The most complex and difficult movements can in
time be performed without the least effort or consciousness. It is not
positively known how it comes that habit is so efficient in facilitating
complex movements; but physiologists admit[102] "that the conducting
power of the nervous fibres increases with the frequency of their
excitement." This applies to the nerves of motion and sensation, as
well as to those connected with the act of thinking. That some physical
change is produced in the nerve-cells or nerves which are habitually
used can hardly be doubted, for otherwise it is impossible to understand
how the tendency to certain acquired movements is inherited. That they
are inherited we see with horses in certain transmitted paces, such as
cantering and ambling, which are not natural to them,--in the pointing
of young pointers and the setting of young setters--in the peculiar
manner of flight of certain breeds of the pigeon, &c. We have analogous
cases with mankind in the inheritance of tricks or unusual gestures, to
which we shall presently recur. To those who admit the gradual evolution
of species, a most striking instance of the perfection with which the
most difficult consensual movements can be transmitted, is afforded by
the humming-bird Sphinx-moth (_Macroglossa_); for this moth, shortly
after its emergence from the cocoon, as shown by the bloom on its
unruffled scales, may be seen poised stationary in the air, with its
long hair-like proboscis uncurled and inserted into the minute orifices
of flowers; and no one, I believe, has ever seen this moth learning to
perform its difficult task, which requires such unerring aim.

When there exists an inherited or instinctive tendency to the
performance of an action, or an inherited taste for certain kinds of
food, some degree of habit in the individual is often or generally
requisite. We find this in the paces of the horse, and to a certain
extent in the pointing of dogs; although some young dogs point
excellently the first time they are taken out, yet they often associate
the proper inherited attitude with a wrong odour, and even with
eyesight. I have heard it asserted that if a calf be allowed to suck
its mother only once, it is much more difficult afterwards to rear it by
hand.[103] Caterpillars which have been fed on the leaves of one kind
of tree, have been known to perish from hunger rather than to eat the
leaves of another tree, although this afforded them their proper food,
under a state of nature;[104] and so it is in many other cases.

The power of Association is admitted by everyone. Mr. Bain remarks, that
"actions, sensations and states of feeling, occurring together or in
close succession, tend to grow together, or cohere, in such a way that
when any one of them is afterwards presented to the mind, the others are
apt to be brought up in idea."[105] It is so important for our purpose
fully to recognize that actions readily become associated with other
actions and with various states of the mind, that I will give a good
many instances, in the first place relating to man, and afterwards to
the lower animals. Some of the instances are of a very trifling nature,
but they are as good for our purpose as more important habits. It is
known to everyone how difficult, or even impossible it is, without
repeated trials, to move the limbs in certain opposed directions which
have never been practised. Analogous cases occur with sensations, as
in the common experiment of rolling a marble beneath the tips of two
crossed fingers, when it feels exactly like two marbles. Everyone
protects himself when falling to the ground by extending his arms,
and as Professor Alison has remarked, few can resist acting thus, when
voluntarily falling on a soft bed. A man when going out of doors puts
on his gloves quite unconsciously; and this may seem an extremely simple
operation, but he who has taught a child to put on gloves, knows that
this is by no means the case.

When our minds are much affected, so are the movements of our bodies;
but here another principle besides habit, namely the undirected overflow
of nerve-force, partially comes into play. Norfolk, in speaking of
Cardinal Wolsey, says--

    "Some strange commotion
     Is in his brain; he bites his lip and starts;
     Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,
     Then, lays his finger on his temple: straight,
     Springs out into fast gait; then, stops again,
     Strikes his breast hard; and anon, he casts
     His eye against the moon: in most strange postures
     We have seen him set himself."--_Hen. VIII_., act 3, sc. 2.


A vulgar man often scratches his head when perplexed in mind; and I
believe that he acts thus from habit, as if he experienced a slightly
uncomfortable bodily sensation, namely, the itching of his head, to
which he is particularly liable, and which he thus relieves. Another man
rubs his eyes when perplexed, or gives a little cough when embarrassed,
acting in either case as if he felt a slightly uncomfortable sensation
in his eyes or windpipe.[106]

From the continued use of the eyes, these organs are especially liable
to be acted on through association under various states of the mind,
although there is manifestly nothing to be seen. A man, as Gratiolet
remarks, who vehemently rejects a proposition, will almost certainly
shut his eyes or turn away his face; but if he accepts the proposition,
he will nod his head in affirmation and open his eyes widely. The man
acts in this latter case as if he clearly saw the thing, and in the
former case as if he did not or would not see it. I have noticed that
persons in describing a horrid sight often shut their eyes momentarily
and firmly, or shake their heads, as if not to see or to drive away
something disagreeable; and I have caught myself, when thinking in the
dark of a horrid spectacle, closing my eyes firmly. In looking suddenly
at any object, or in looking all around, everyone raises his eyebrows,
so that the eyes may be quickly and widely opened; and Duchenne remarks
that[107] a person in trying to remember something often raises his
eyebrows, as if to see it. A Hindoo gentleman made exactly the same
remark to Mr. Erskine in regard to his countrymen. I noticed a young
lady earnestly trying to recollect a painter's name, and she first
looked to one corner of the ceiling and then to the opposite corner,
arching the one eyebrow on that side; although, of course, there was
nothing to be seen there.

In most of the foregoing cases, we can understand how the associated
movements were acquired through habit; but with some individuals,
certain strange gestures or tricks have arisen in association with
certain states of the mind, owing to wholly inexplicable causes, and are
undoubtedly inherited. I have elsewhere given one instance from my own
observation of an extraordinary and complex gesture, associated with
pleasurable feelings, which was transmitted from a father to his
daughter, as well as some other analogous facts.[108]

Another curious instance of an odd inherited movement, associated
with the wish to obtain an object, will be given in the course of this
volume.

There are other actions which are commonly performed under certain
circumstances, independently of habit, and which seem to be due to
imitation or some sort of sympathy. Thus persons cutting anything with a
pair of scissors may be seen to move their jaws simultaneously with the
blades of the scissors. Children learning to write often twist about
their tongues as their fingers move, in a ridiculous fashion. When a
public singer suddenly becomes a little hoarse, many of those present
may be heard, as I have been assured by a gentleman on whom I can rely,
to clear their throats; but here habit probably comes into play, as we
clear our own throats under similar circumstances. I have also been told
that at leaping matches, as the performer makes his spring, many of
the spectators, generally men and boys, move their feet; but here again
habit probably comes into play, for it is very doubtful whether women
would thus act.

_Reflex actions_--Reflex actions, in the strict sense of the term,
are due to the excitement of a peripheral nerve, which transmits its
influence to certain nerve-cells, and these in their turn excite certain
muscles or glands into action; and all this may take place without any
sensation or consciousness on our part, though often thus accompanied.
As many reflex actions are highly expressive, the subject must here
be noticed at some little length. We shall also see that some of them
graduate into, and can hardly be distinguished from actions which have
arisen through habit? Coughing and sneezing are familiar instances of
reflex actions. With infants the first act of respiration is often a
sneeze, although this requires the co-ordinated movement of numerous
muscles. Respiration is partly voluntary, but mainly reflex, and is
performed in the most natural and best manner without the interference
of the will. A vast number of complex movements are reflex. As good an
instance as can be given is the often-quoted one of a decapitated
frog, which cannot of course feel, and cannot consciously perform, any
movement. Yet if a drop of acid be placed on the lower surface of the
thigh of a frog in this state, it will rub off the drop with the upper
surface of the foot of the same leg. If this foot be cut off, it cannot
thus act. "After some fruitless efforts, therefore, it gives up trying
in that way, seems restless, as though, says Pfluger, it was seeking
some other way, and at last it makes use of the foot of the other leg
and succeeds in rubbing off the acid. Notably we have here not merely
contractions of muscles, but combined and harmonized contractions in
due sequence for a special purpose. These are actions that have all the
appearance of being guided by intelligence and instigated by will in
an animal, the recognized organ of whose intelligence and will has been
removed."[110]

We see the difference between reflex and voluntary movements in very
young children not being able to perform, as I am informed by Sir
Henry Holland, certain acts somewhat analogous to those of sneezing and
coughing, namely, in their not being able to blow their noses (i. e. to
compress the nose and blow violently through the passage), and in their
not being able to clear their throats of phlegm. They have to learn to
perform these acts, yet they are performed by us, when a little older,
almost as easily as reflex actions. Sneezing and coughing, however,
can be controlled by the will only partially or not at all; whilst
the clearing the throat and blowing the nose are completely under our
command.

When we are conscious of the presence of an irritating particle in our
nostrils or windpipe--that is, when the same sensory nerve-cells are
excited, as in the case of sneezing and coughing--we can voluntarily
expel the particle by forcibly driving air through these passages; but
we cannot do this with nearly the same force, rapidity, and precision,
as by a reflex action. In this latter case the sensory nerve-cells
apparently excite the motor nerve-cells without any waste of power
by first communicating with the cerebral hemispheres--the seat of our
consciousness and volition. In all cases there seems to exist a profound
antagonism between the same movements, as directed by the will and by a
reflex stimulant, in the force with which they are performed and in
the facility with which they are excited. As Claude Bernard asserts,
"L'influence du cerveau tend donc a entraver les mouvements reflexes, a
limiter leur force et leur etendue."[111]

The conscious wish to perform a reflex action sometimes stops or
interrupts its performance, though the proper sensory nerves may be
stimulated. For instance, many years ago I laid a small wager with a
dozen young men that they would not sneeze if they took snuff, although
they all declared that they invariably did so; accordingly they all took
a pinch, but from wishing much to succeed, not one sneezed, though their
eyes watered, and all, without exception, had to pay me the wager. Sir
H. Holland remarks[112] that attention paid to the act of swallowing
interferes with the proper movements; from which it probably follows, at
least in part, that some persons find it so difficult to swallow a pill.

Another familiar instance of a reflex action is the involuntary closing
of the eyelids when the surface of the eye is touched. A similar winking
movement is caused when a blow is directed towards the face; but this
is an habitual and not a strictly reflex action, as the stimulus is
conveyed through the mind and not by the excitement of a peripheral
nerve. The whole body and head are generally at the same time drawn
suddenly backwards. These latter movements, however, can be prevented,
if the danger does not appear to the imagination imminent; but our
reason telling us that there is no danger does not suffice. I may
mention a trifling fact, illustrating this point, and which at the time
amused me. I put my face close to the thick glass-plate in front of a
puff-adder in the Zoological Gardens, with the firm determination of not
starting back if the snake struck at me; but, as soon as the blow was
struck, my resolution went for nothing, and I jumped a yard or two
backwards with astonishing rapidity. My will and reason were powerless
against the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced.

The violence of a start seems to depend partly on the vividness of the
imagination, and partly on the condition, either habitual or temporary,
of the nervous system. He who will attend to the starting of his horse,
when tired and fresh, will perceive how perfect is the gradation from a
mere glance at some unexpected object, with a momentary doubt whether it
is dangerous, to a jump so rapid and violent, that the animal probably
could not voluntarily whirl round in so rapid a manner. The nervous
system of a fresh and highly-fed horse sends its order to the motory
system so quickly, that no time is allowed for him to consider whether
or not the danger is real. After one violent start, when he is excited
and the blood flows freely through his brain, he is very apt to start
again; and so it is, as I have noticed, with young infants.

A start from a sudden noise, when the stimulus is conveyed through
the auditory nerves, is always accompanied in grown-up persons by the
winking of the eyelids.[113] I observed, however, that though my infants
started at sudden sounds, when under a fortnight old, they certainly did
not always wink their eyes, and I believe never did so. The start of an
older infant apparently represents a vague catching hold of something to
prevent falling. I shook a pasteboard box close before the eyes of one
of my infants, when 114 days old, and it did not in the least wink; but
when I put a few comfits into the box, holding it in the same position
as before, and rattled them, the child blinked its eyes violently
every time, and started a little. It was obviously impossible that a
carefully-guarded infant could have learnt by experience that a rattling
sound near its eyes indicated danger to them. But such experience
will have been slowly gained at a later age during a long series of
generations; and from what we know of inheritance, there is nothing
improbable in the transmission of a habit to the offspring at an earlier
age than that at which it was first acquired by the parents.

From the foregoing remarks it seems probable that some actions, which
were at first performed consciously, have become through habit and
association converted into reflex actions, and are now so firmly fixed
and inherited, that they are performed, even when not of the least
use,[114] as often as the same causes arise, which originally excited
them in us through the volition. In such cases the sensory nerve-cells
excite the motor cells, without first communicating with those cells
on which our consciousness and volition depend. It is probable
that sneezing and coughing were originally acquired by the habit of
expelling, as violently as possible, any irritating particle from the
sensitive air-passages. As far as time is concerned, there has been more
than enough for these habits to have become innate or converted into
reflex actions; for they are common to most or all of the higher
quadrupeds, and must therefore have been first acquired at a very remote
period. Why the act of clearing the throat is not a reflex action, and
has to be learnt by our children, I cannot pretend to say; but we can
see why blowing the nose on a handkerchief has to be learnt.

It is scarcely credible that the movements of a headless frog, when
it wipes off a drop of acid or other object from its thigh, and which
movements are so well coordinated for a special purpose, were not at
first performed voluntarily, being afterwards rendered easy through
long-continued habit so as at last to be performed unconsciously, or
independently of the cerebral hemispheres.

So again it appears probable that starting was originally acquired by
the habit of jumping away as quickly as possible from danger, whenever
any of our senses gave us warning. Starting, as we have seen, is
accompanied by the blinking of the eyelids so as to protect the eyes,
the most tender and sensitive organs of the body; and it is, I believe,
always accompanied by a sudden and forcible inspiration, which is the
natural preparation for any violent effort. But when a man or horse
starts, his heart beats wildly against his ribs, and here it may be
truly said we have an organ which has never been under the control of
the will, partaking in the general reflex movements of the body. To this
point, however, I shall return in a future chapter.

The contraction of the iris, when the retina is stimulated by a bright
light, is another instance of a movement, which it appears cannot
possibly have been at first voluntarily performed and then fixed by
habit; for the iris is not known to be under the conscious control of
the will in any animal. In such cases some explanation, quite distinct
from habit, will have to be discovered. The radiation of nerve-force
from strongly-excited nerve-cells to other connected cells, as in the
case of a bright light on the retina causing a sneeze, may perhaps aid
us in understanding how some reflex actions originated. A radiation of
nerve-force of this kind, if it caused a movement tending to lessen
the primary irritation, as in the case of the contraction of the iris
preventing too much light from falling on the retina, might afterwards
have been taken advantage of and modified for this special purpose.

It further deserves notice that reflex actions are in all probability
liable to slight variations, as are all corporeal structures and
instincts; and any variations which were beneficial and of sufficient
importance, would tend to be preserved and inherited. Thus reflex
actions, when once gained for one purpose, might afterwards be modified
independently of the will or habit, so as to serve for some distinct
purpose. Such cases would be parallel with those which, as we have every
reason to believe, have occurred with many instincts; for although
some instincts have been developed simply through long-continued and
inherited habit, other highly complex ones have been developed through
the preservation of variations of pre-existing instincts--that is,
through natural selection.

I have discussed at some little length, though as I am well aware, in a
very imperfect manner, the acquirement of reflex actions, because they
are often brought into play in connection with movements expressive of
our emotions; and it was necessary to show that at least some of them
might have been Erst acquired through the will in order to satisfy a
desire, or to relieve a disagreeable sensation.

_Associated habitual movements in the lower animals_.--I have already
given in the case of Man several instances of movements associated with
various states of the mind or body, which are now purposeless, but
which were originally of use, and are still of use under certain
circumstances. As this subject is very important for us, I will here
give a considerable number of analogous facts, with reference to
animals; although many of them are of a very trifling nature. My object
is to show that certain movements were originally performed for a
definite end, and that, under nearly the same circumstances, they are
still pertinaciously performed through habit when not of the least use.
That the tendency in most of the following cases is inherited, we may
infer from such actions being performed in the same manner by all the
individuals, young and old, of he same species. We shall also see
that they are excited by the most diversified, often circuitous, and
sometimes mistaken associations.

Dogs, when they wish to go to sleep on a carpet or other hard surface,
generally turn round and round and scratch the ground with their
fore-paws in a senseless manner, as if they intended to trample down the
grass and scoop out a hollow, as no doubt their wild parents did, when
they lived on open grassy plains or in the woods. Jackals, fennecs, and
other allied animals in the Zoological Gardens, treat their straw in
this manner; but it is a rather odd circumstance that the keepers, after
observing for some months, have never seen the wolves thus behave. A
semi-idiotic dog--and an animal in this condition would be particularly
liable to follow a senseless habit--was observed by a friend to turn
completely round on a carpet thirteen times before going to sleep.


Many carnivorous animals, as they crawl towards their prey and prepare
to rush or spring on it, lower their heads and crouch, partly, as it
would appear, to hide themselves, and partly to get ready for their
rush; and this habit in an exaggerated form has become hereditary in our
pointers and setters. Now I have noticed scores of times that when two
strange dogs meet on an open road, the one which first sees the other,
though at the distance of one or two hundred yards, after the first
glance always lowers its bead, generally crouches a little, or even lies
down; that is, he takes the proper attitude for concealing himself and
for making a rush or spring although the road
is quite open and the distance great. Again, dogs of
all kinds when intently watching and slowly approaching their prey,
frequently keep one of their fore-legs doubled up for a long time, ready
for the next cautious step; and this is eminently characteristic of the
pointer. But from habit they behave in exactly the same manner whenever
their attention is aroused (fig. 4). I have seen a dog at the foot of a
high wall, listening attentively to a sound on the opposite side, with
one leg doubled up; and in this case there could have been no intention
of making a cautious approach.

[Illustration: Small dog watching a cat on a table. Figure 4]

{illust. caption = for making a rush or FIG. 4.--Small dog watching a
cat on a table. From a photograph taken  by Mr. Rejlander.}

Dogs after voiding their excrement often make with all four feet a
few scratches backwards, even on a bare stone pavement, as if for the
purpose of covering up their excrement with earth, in nearly the same
manner as do cats. Wolves and jackals behave in the Zoological Gardens
in exactly the same manner, yet, as I am assured by the keepers, neither
wolves, jackals, nor foxes, when they have the means of doing so, ever
cover up their excrement, any more than do dogs. All these animals,
however, bury superfluous food. Hence, if we rightly understand the
meaning of the above cat-like habit, of which there can be little
doubt, we have a purposeless remnant of an habitual movement, which was
originally followed by some remote progenitor of the dog-genus for a
definite purpose, and which has been retained for a prodigious length of
time.

Dogs and jackals[115] take much pleasure in rolling and rubbing their
necks and backs on carrion. The odour seems delightful to them, though
dogs at least do not eat carrion. Mr. Bartlett has observed wolves for
me, and has given them carrion, but has never seen them roll on it. I
have heard it remarked, and I believe it to be true, that the larger
dogs, which are probably descended from wolves, do not so often roll in
carrion as do smaller dogs, which are probably descended from jackals.
When a piece of brown biscuit is offered to a terrier of mine and she is
not hungry (and I have heard of similar instances), she first tosses
it about and worries it, as if it were a rat or other prey; she then
repeatedly rolls on it precisely as if it were a piece of carrion, and
at last eats it. It would appear that an imaginary relish has to be
given to the distasteful morsel; and to effect this the dog acts in
his habitual manner, as if the biscuit was a live animal or smelt like
carrion, though he knows better than we do that this is not the case.
I have seen this same terrier act in the same manner after killing a
little bird or mouse.

Dogs scratch themselves by a rapid movement of one of their hind-feet;
and when their backs are rubbed with a stick, so strong is the habit,
that they cannot help rapidly scratching the air or the ground in a
useless and ludicrous manner. The terrier just alluded to, when thus
scratched with a stick, will sometimes show her delight by another
habitual movement, namely, by licking the air as if it were my hand.

Horses scratch themselves by nibbling those parts of their bodies which
they can reach with their teeth; but more commonly one horse shows
another where he wants to be scratched, and they then nibble each other.
A friend whose attention I had called to the subject, observed that when
he rubbed his horse's neck, the animal protruded his head, uncovered his
teeth, and moved his jaws, exactly as if nibbling another horse's
neck, for he could never have nibbled his own neck. If a horse is much
tickled, as when curry-combed, his wish to bite something becomes so
intolerably strong, that he will clatter his teeth together, and though
not vicious, bite his groom. At the same time from habit he closely
depresses his ears, so as to protect them from being bitten, as if he
were fighting with another horse.

A horse when eager to start on a journey makes the nearest approach
which he can to the habitual movement of progression by pawing the
ground. Now when horses in their stalls are about to be fed and are
eager for their corn, they paw the pavement or the straw. Two of
my horses thus behave when they see or hear the corn given to
their neighbours. But here we have what may almost be called a true
expression, as pawing the ground is universally recognized as a sign of
eagerness.

Cats cover up their excrements of both kinds with earth; and my
grandfather[117]{sic} saw a kitten scraping ashes over a spoonful of
pure water spilt on the hearth; so that here an habitual or instinctive
action was falsely excited, not by a previous act or by odour, but by
eyesight. It is well known that cats dislike wetting their feet, owing,
it is probable, to their having aboriginally inhabited the dry country
of Egypt; and when they wet their feet they shake them violently. My
daughter poured some water into a glass close to the head of a kitten;
and it immediately shook its feet in the usual manner; so that here we
have an habitual movement falsely excited by an associated sound instead
of by the sense of touch.

Kittens, puppies, young pigs and probably many other young animals,
alternately push with their forefeet against the mammary glands of their
mothers, to excite a freer secretion of milk, or to make it flow. Now it
is very common with young cats, and not at all rare with old cats of
the common and Persian breeds (believed by some naturalists to be
specifically extinct), when comfortably lying on a warm shawl or
other soft substance, to pound it quietly and alternately with their
fore-feet; their toes being spread out and claws slightly protruded,
precisely as when sucking their mother. That it is the same movement is
clearly shown by their often at the same time taking a bit of the shawl
into their mouths and sucking it; generally closing their eyes and
purring from delight. This curious movement is commonly excited only in
association with the sensation of a warm soft surface; but I have seen
an old cat, when pleased by having its back scratched, pounding the air
with its feet in the same manner; so that this action has almost become
the expression of a pleasurable sensation.

Having referred to the act of sucking, I may add that this complex
movement, as well as the alternate protrusion of the fore-feet, are
reflex actions; for they are performed if a finger moistened with milk
is placed in the mouth of a puppy, the front part of whose brain has
been removed.[117] It has recently been stated in France, that the
action of sucking is excited solely through the sense of smell, so that
if the olfactory nerves of a puppy are destroyed, it never sucks. In
like manner the wonderful power which a chicken possesses only a few
hours after being hatched, of picking up small particles of food,
seems to be started into action through the sense of hearing; for with
chickens hatched by artificial heat, a good observer found that "making
a noise with the finger-nail against a board, in imitation of the
hen-mother, first taught them to peck at their meat."[118]

I will give only one other instance of an habitual and purposeless
movement. The Sheldrake (_Tadorna_) feeds on the sands left uncovered
by the tide, and when a worm-cast is discovered, "it begins patting the
ground with its feet, dancing as it were, over the hole;" and this makes
the worm come to the surface. Now Mr. St. John says, that when his tame
Sheldrakes "came to ask for food, they patted the ground in an impatient
and rapid manner."[119] This therefore may almost be considered as their
expression of hunger. Mr. Bartlett informs me that the Flamingo and the
Kagu (_Rhinochetus jubatus_) when anxious to be fed, beat the ground
with their feet in the same odd manner. So again Kingfishers, when they
catch a fish, always beat it until it is killed; and in the Zoological
Gardens they always beat the raw meat, with which they are sometimes
fed, before devouring it.

We have now, I think, sufficiently shown the truth of our first
Principle, namely, that when any sensation, desire, dislike, &c., has
led during a long series of generations to some voluntary movement,
then a tendency to the performance of a similar movement will almost
certainly be excited, whenever the same, or any analogous or associated
sensation &c., although very weak, is experienced; notwithstanding that
the movement in this case may not be of the least use. Such habitual
movements are often, or generally inherited; and they then differ but
little from reflex actions. When we treat of the special expressions
of man, the latter part of our first Principle, as given at the
commencement of this chapter, will be seen to hold good; namely, that
when movements, associated through habit with certain states of the
mind, are partially repressed by the will, the strictly involuntary
muscles, as well as those which are least under the separate control
of the will, are liable still to act; and their action is often highly
expressive. Conversely, when the will is temporarily or permanently
weakened, the voluntary muscles fail before the involuntary. It is a
fact familiar to pathologists, as Sir C. Bell remarks,[120] "that when
debility arises from affection of the brain, the influence is greatest
on those muscles which are, in their natural condition, most under the
command of the will." We shall, also, in our future chapters, consider
another proposition included in our first Principle; namely, that
the checking of one habitual movement sometimes requires other slight
movements; these latter serving as a means of expression.



CHAPTER II. -- GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EXPRESSION--_continued_.

The Principle of Antithesis--Instances in the dog and cat--Origin of
the principle--Conventional signs--The principle of antithesis has not
arisen from opposite actions being consciously performed under opposite
impulses.


WE will now consider our second Principle, that of Antithesis. Certain
states of the mind lead, as we have seen in the last chapter, to certain
habitual movements which were primarily, or may still be, of service;
and we shall find that when a directly opposite state of mind is
induced, there is a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance
of movements of a directly opposite nature, though these have never been
of any service. A few striking instances of antithesis will be given,
when we treat of the special expressions of man; but as, in these
cases, we are particularly liable to confound conventional or artificial
gestures and expressions with those which are innate or universal, and
which alone deserve to rank as true expressions, I will in the present
chapter almost confine myself to the lower animals.

[Illustration: Dog in a hostile frame of mind.  Fig. 5]

[Illustration:   Fig. 6]

[Illustration: Dog in a hostile frame of mind.  Fig. 7]


When a dog approaches a strange dog or man in a savage or hostile frame
of mind be walks upright and very stiffly; his head is slightly raised,
or not much lowered; the tail is held erect, and quite rigid; the
hairs bristle, especially along the neck and back; the pricked ears are
directed forwards, and the eyes have a fixed stare: (see figs. 5 and
7). These actions, as will hereafter be explained, follow from the
dog's intention to attack his enemy, and are thus to a large extent
intelligible. As he prepares to spring with a savage growl on his enemy,
the canine teeth are uncovered, and the ears are pressed close backwards
on the head; but with these latter actions, we are not here concerned.
Let us now suppose that the dog suddenly discovers that the man he is
approaching, is not a stranger, but his master; and let it be observed
how completely and instantaneously his whole bearing is reversed.
Instead of walking upright, the body sinks downwards or even crouches,
and is thrown into flexuous movements; his tail, instead of being held
stiff and upright, is lowered and wagged from side to side; his hair
instantly becomes smooth; his ears are depressed and drawn backwards,
but not closely to the head; and his lips hang loosely. From the drawing
back of the ears, the eyelids become elongated, and the eyes no longer
appear round and staring. It should be added that the animal is at
such times in an excited condition from joy; and nerve-force will be
generated in excess, which naturally leads to action of some kind. Not
one of the above movements, so clearly expressive of affection, are of
the least direct service to the animal. They are explicable, as far as
I can see, solely from being in complete opposition or antithesis to the
attitude and movements which, from intelligible causes, are assumed when
a dog intends to fight, and which consequently are expressive of anger.
I request the reader to look at the four accompanying sketches, which
have been given in order to recall vividly the appearance of a dog under
these two states of mind. It is, however, not a little difficult to
represent affection in a dog, whilst caressing his master and wagging
his tail, as the essence of the expression lies in the continuous
flexuous movements.

[Illustration: Dog Carressing his master.  Fig. 8]

We will now turn to the cat. When this animal is threatened by a dog, it
arches its back in a surprising manner, erects its hair, opens its mouth
and spits. But we are not here concerned with this well-known attitude,
expressive of terror combined with anger; we are concerned only with
that of rage or anger. This is not often seen, but may be observed when
two cats are fighting together; and I have seen it well exhibited by a
savage cat whilst plagued by a boy. The attitude is almost exactly the
same as that of a tiger disturbed and growling over its food, which
every one must have beheld in menageries. The animal assumes a crouching
position, with the body extended; and the whole tail, or the tip alone,
is lashed or curled from side to side. The hair is not in the least
erect. Thus far, the attitude and movements are nearly the same as when
the animal is prepared to spring on its prey, and when, no doubt, it
feels savage. But when preparing to fight, there is this difference,
that the ears are closely pressed backwards; the mouth is partially
opened, showing the teeth; the fore feet are occasionally struck out
with protruded claws; and the animal occasionally utters a fierce growl.
(See figs. 9 and 10.) All, or almost all these actions naturally follow
(as hereafter to be explained), from the cat's manner and intention of
attacking its enemy.

[Illustration: Cat, savage, and prepared to fight. Fig. 9]

[Illustration: Cat in an affectionate frame of mind. Fig. 10]

Let us now look at a cat in a directly opposite frame of mind, whilst
feeling affectionate and caressing her master; and mark how opposite
is her attitude in every respect. She now stands upright with her back
slightly arched, which makes the hair appear rather rough, but it does
not bristle; her tail, instead of being extended and lashed from side
to side, is held quite still and perpendicularly upwards; her ears are
erect and pointed; her mouth is closed; and she rubs against her master
with a purr instead of a growl. Let it further be observed how widely
different is the whole bearing of an affectionate cat from that of a
dog, when with his body crouching and flexuous, his tail lowered and
wagging, and ears depressed, he caresses his master. This contrast in
the attitudes and movements of these two carnivorous animals, under the
same pleased and affectionate frame of mind, can be explained, as it
appears to me, solely by their movements standing in complete antithesis
to those which are naturally assumed, when these animals feel savage and
are prepared either to fight or to seize their prey.

In these cases of the dog and cat, there is every reason to believe that
the gestures both of hostility and affection are innate or inherited;
for they are almost identically the same in the different races of the
species, and in all the individuals of the same race, both young and
old.

I will here give one other instance of antithesis in expression. I
formerly possessed a large dog, who, like every other dog, was much
pleased to go out walking. He showed his pleasure by trotting gravely
before me with high steps, head much raised, moderately erected ears,
and tail carried aloft but not stiffly. Not far from my house a path
branches off to the right, leading to the hot-house, which I used often
to visit for a few moments, to look at my experimental plants. This was
always a great disappointment to the dog, as he did not know whether I
should continue my walk; and the instantaneous and complete change of
expression which came over him as soon as my body swerved in the least
towards the path (and I sometimes tried this as an experiment) was
laughable. His look of dejection was known to every member of the
family, and was called his _hot-house face_. This consisted in the head
drooping much, the whole body sinking a little and remaining motionless;
the ears and tail falling suddenly down, but the tail was by no means
wagged. With the falling of the ears and of his great chaps, the eyes
became much changed in appearance, and I fancied that they looked less
bright. His aspect was that of piteous, hopeless dejection; and it was,
as I have said, laughable, as the cause was so slight. Every detail
in his attitude was in complete opposition to his former joyful yet
dignified bearing; and can be explained, as it appears to me, in no
other way, except through the principle of antithesis. Had not the
change been so instantaneous, I should have attributed it to his
lowered spirits affecting, as in the case of man, the nervous system and
circulation, and consequently the tone of his whole muscular frame; and
this may have been in part the cause.

We will now consider how the principle of antithesis in expression has
arisen. With social animals, the power of intercommunication between
the members of the same community,--and with other species, between the
opposite sexes, as well as between the young and the old,--is of the
highest importance to them. This is generally effected by means of the
voice, but it is certain that gestures and expressions are to a certain
extent mutually intelligible. Man not only uses inarticulate cries,
gestures, and expressions, but has invented articulate language; if,
indeed, the word INVENTED can be applied to a process, completed by
innumerable steps, half-consciously made. Any one who has watched
monkeys will not doubt that they perfectly understand each other's
gestures and expression, and to a large extent, as Rengger asserts,[201]
those of man. An animal when going to attack another, or when afraid of
another, often makes itself appear terrible, by erecting its hair,
thus increasing the apparent bulk of its body, by showing its teeth, or
brandishing its horns, or by uttering fierce sounds.

As the power of intercommunication is certainly of high service to many
animals, there is no _a priori_ improbability in the supposition, that
gestures manifestly of an opposite nature to those by which certain
feelings are already expressed, should at first have been voluntarily
employed under the influence of an opposite state of feeling. The fact
of the gestures being now innate, would be no valid objection to the
belief that they were at first intentional; for if practised during many
generations, they would probably at last be inherited. Nevertheless it
is more than doubtful, as we shall immediately see, whether any of
the cases which come under our present head of antithesis, have thus
originated.

With conventional signs which are not innate, such as those used by the
deaf and dumb and by savages, the principle of opposition or antithesis
has been partially brought into play. The Cistercian monks thought it
sinful to speak, and as they could not avoid holding some communication,
they invented a gesture language, in which the principle of opposition
seems to have been employed.[202] Dr. Scott, of the Exeter Deaf and Dumb
Institution, writes to me that "opposites are greatly used in teaching
the deaf and dumb, who have a lively sense of them." Nevertheless I
have been surprised how few unequivocal instances can be adduced. This
depends partly on all the signs having commonly had some natural origin;
and partly on the practice of the deaf and dumb and of savages to
contract their signs as much as possible for the sake of rapidity?[203]
Hence their natural source or origin often becomes doubtful or is
completely lost; as is likewise the case with articulate language.

Many signs, moreover, which plainly stand in opposition to each other,
appear to have had on both sides a significant origin. This seems
to hold good with the signs used by the deal and dumb for light and
darkness, for strength and weakness, &c. In a future chapter I shall
endeavour to show that the opposite gestures of affirmation and
negation, namely, vertically nodding and laterally shaking the head,
have both probably had a natural beginning. The waving of the hand from
right to left, which is used as a negative by some savages, may have
been invented in imitation of shaking the head; but whether the opposite
movement of waving the hand in a straight line from the face, which
is used in affirmation, has arisen through antithesis or in some quite
distinct manner, is doubtful.

If we now turn to the gestures which are innate or common to all the
individuals of the same species, and which come under the present head
of antithesis, it is extremely doubtful, whether any of them were at
first deliberately invented and consciously performed. With mankind
the best instance of a gesture standing in direct opposition to other
movements, naturally assumed under an opposite frame of mind, is that
of shrugging the shoulders. This expresses impotence or an
apology,--something which cannot be done, or cannot be avoided. The
gesture is sometimes used consciously and voluntarily, but it is
extremely improbable that it was at first deliberately invented, and
afterwards fixed by habit; for not only do young children sometimes
shrug their shoulders under the above states of mind, but the movement
is accompanied, as will be shown in a future chapter, by various
subordinate movements, which not one man in a thousand is aware of,
unless he has specially attended to the subject.

Dogs when approaching a strange dog, may find it useful to show by their
movements that they are friendly, and do not wish to fight. When two
young dogs in play are growling and biting each other's faces and legs,
it is obvious that they mutually understand each other's gestures and
manners. There seems, indeed, some degree of instinctive knowledge in
puppies and kittens, that they must not use their sharp little teeth
or claws too freely in their play, though this sometimes happens and
a squeal is the result; otherwise they would often injure each other's
eyes. When my terrier bites my hand in play, often snarling at the same
time, if he bites too hard and I say GENTLY, GENTLY, he goes on biting,
but answers me by a few wags of the tail, which seems to say "Never
mind, it is all fun." Although dogs do thus express, and may wish to
express, to other dogs and to man, that they are in a friendly state of
mind, it is incredible that they could ever have deliberately thought
of drawing back and depressing their ears, instead of holding them
erect,--of lowering and wagging their tails, instead of keeping them
stiff and upright, &c., because they knew that these movements stood in
direct opposition to those assumed under an opposite and savage frame of
mind.

Again, when a cat, or rather when some early progenitor of the species,
from feeling affectionate first slightly arched its back, held its tail
perpendicularly upwards and pricked its ears, can it be believed that
the animal consciously wished thus to show that its frame of mind was
directly the reverse of that, when from being ready to fight or to
spring on its prey, it assumed a crouching attitude, curled its tail
from side to side and depressed its ears? Even still less can I believe
that my dog voluntarily put on his dejected attitude and "_hot-house
face_," which formed so complete a contrast to his previous cheerful
attitude and whole bearing. It cannot be supposed that he knew that I
should understand his expression, and that he could thus soften my heart
and make me give up visiting the hot-house.

Hence for the development of the movements which come under the present
head, some other principle, distinct from the will and consciousness,
must have intervened. This principle appears to be that every movement
which we have voluntarily performed throughout our lives has required
the action of certain muscles; and when we have performed a directly
opposite movement, an opposite set of muscles has been habitually
brought into play,--as in turning to the right or to the left, in
pushing away or pulling an object towards us, and in lifting or lowering
a weight. So strongly are our intentions and movements associated
together, that if we eagerly wish an object to move in any direction,
we can hardly avoid moving our bodies in the same direction, although
we may be perfectly aware that this can have no influence. A good
illustration of this fact has already been given in the Introduction,
namely, in the grotesque movements of a young and eager billiard-player,
whilst watching the course of his ball. A man or child in a passion, if
he tells any one in a loud voice to begone, generally moves his arm as
if to push him away, although the offender may not be standing near, and
although there may be not the least need to explain by a gesture what is
meant. On the other hand, if we eagerly desire some one to approach
us closely, we act as if pulling him towards us; and so in innumerable
other instances.

As the performance of ordinary movements of an opposite kind, under
opposite impulses of the will, has become habitual in us and in the
lower animals, so when actions of one kind have become firmly associated
with any sensation or emotion, it appears natural that actions of
a directly opposite kind, though of no use, should be unconsciously
performed through habit and association, under the influence of a
directly opposite sensation or emotion. On this principle alone can I
understand how the gestures and expressions which come under the present
head of antithesis have originated. If indeed they are serviceable to
man or to any other animal, in aid of inarticulate cries or language,
they will likewise be voluntarily employed, and the habit will thus be
strengthened. But whether or not of service as a means of communication,
the tendency to perform opposite movements under opposite sensations or
emotions would, if we may judge by analogy, become hereditary through
long practice; and there cannot be a doubt that several expressive
movements due to the principle of antithesis are inherited.



CHAPTER III. -- GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EXPRESSION--_concluded_.

The principle of direct action of the excited nervous system on the
body, independently of the will and in part of habit--Change of
colour in the hair--Trembling of the muscles--Modified
secretions--Perspiration--Expression of extreme pain--Of rage, great
joy, and terror--Contrast between the emotions which cause and do
not cause expressive movements--Exciting and depressing states of the
mind--Summary.


WE now come to our third Principle, namely, that certain actions which
we recognize as expressive of certain states of the mind, are the direct
result of the constitution of the nervous system, and have been from the
first independent of the will, and, to a large extent, of habit. When
the sensorium is strongly excited nerve-force is generated in excess,
and is transmitted in certain directions, dependent on the connection of
the nerve-cells, and, as far as the muscular system is concerned, on
the nature of the movements which have been habitually practised. Or
the supply of nerve-force may, as it appears, be interrupted. Of course
every movement which we make is determined by the constitution of the
nervous system; but actions performed in obedience to the will, or
through habit, or through the principle of antithesis, are here as far
as possible excluded. Our present subject is very obscure, but, from its
importance, must be discussed at some little length; and it is always
advisable to perceive clearly our ignorance.

The most striking case, though a rare and abnormal one, which can be
adduced of the direct influence of the nervous system, when strongly
affected, on the body, is the loss of colour in the hair, which has
occasionally been observed after extreme terror or grief. One authentic
instance has been recorded, in the case of a man brought out for
execution in India, in which the change of colour was so rapid that it
was perceptible to the eye.[301]

Another good case is that of the trembling of the muscles, which is
common to man and to many, or most, of the lower animals. Trembling is
of no service, often of much disservice, and cannot have been at first
acquired through the will, and then rendered habitual in association
with any emotion. I am assured by an eminent authority that young
children do not tremble, but go into convulsions under the circumstances
which would induce excessive trembling in adults. Trembling is excited
in different individuals in very different degrees and by the most
diversified causes,--by cold to the surface, before fever-fits, although
the temperature of the body is then above the normal standard; in
blood-poisoning, delirium tremens, and other diseases; by general
failure of power in old age; by exhaustion after excessive fatigue;
locally from severe injuries, such as burns; and, in an especial manner,
by the passage of a catheter. Of all emotions, fear notoriously is the
most apt to induce trembling; but so do occasionally great anger and
joy. I remember once seeing a boy who had just shot his first snipe on
the wing, and his hands trembled to such a degree from delight, that he
could not for some time reload his gun; and I have heard of an exactly
similar case with an Australian savage, to whom a gun had been lent.
Fine music, from the vague emotions thus excited, causes a shiver to run
down the backs of some persons. There seems to be very little in
common in the above several physical causes and emotions to account for
trembling; and Sir J. Paget, to whom I am indebted for several of the
above statements, informs me that the subject is a very obscure one. As
trembling is sometimes caused by rage, long before exhaustion can have
set in, and as it sometimes accompanies great joy, it would appear that
any strong excitement of the nervous system interrupts the steady flow
of nerve-force to the muscles.[302]

The manner in which the secretions of the alimentary canal and of
certain glands--as the liver, kidneys, or mammae are affected by strong
emotions, is another excellent instance of the direct action of
the sensorium on these organs, independently of the will or of any
serviceable associated habit. There is the greatest difference in
different persons in the parts which are thus affected, and in the
degree of their affection.

The heart, which goes on uninterruptedly beating night and day in so
wonderful a manner, is extremely sensitive to external stimulants.
The great physiologist, Claude Bernard,[303] has shown bow the least
excitement of a sensitive nerve reacts on the heart; even when a nerve
is touched so slightly that no pain can possibly be felt by the animal
under experiment. Hence when the mind is strongly excited, we might
expect that it would instantly affect in a direct manner the heart; and
this is universally acknowledged and felt to be the case. Claude Bernard
also repeatedly insists, and this deserves especial notice, that when
the heart is affected it reacts on the brain; and the state of the brain
again reacts through the pneumo-gastric nerve on the heart; so that
under any excitement there will be much mutual action and reaction
between these, the two most important organs of the body.

The vaso-motor system, which regulates the diameter of the small
arteries, is directly acted on by the sensorium, as we see when a man
blushes from shame; but in this latter case the checked transmission of
nerve-force to the vessels of the face can, I think, be partly explained
in a curious manner through habit. We shall also be able to throw some
light, though very little, on the involuntary erection of the hair under
the emotions of terror and rage. The secretion of tears depends, no
doubt, on the connection of certain nerve-cells; but here again we can
trace some few of the steps by which the flow of nerve-force through the
requisite channels has become habitual under certain emotions.

A brief consideration of the outward signs of some of the stronger
sensations and emotions will best serve to show us, although vaguely,
in how complex a manner the principle under consideration of the direct
action of the excited nervous system of the body, is combined with the
principle of habitually associated, serviceable movements.

When animals suffer from an agony of pain, they generally writhe about
with frightful contortions; and those which habitually use their voices
utter piercing cries or groans. Almost every muscle of the body
is brought into strong action. With man the mouth may be closely
compressed, or more commonly the lips are retracted, with the teeth
clenched or ground together. There is said to be "gnashing of teeth" in
hell; and I have plainly heard the grinding of the molar teeth of a cow
which was suffering acutely from inflammation of the bowels. The female
hippopotamus in the Zoological Gardens, when she produced her young,
suffered greatly; she incessantly walked about, or rolled on her sides,
opening and closing her jaws, and clattering her teeth together.[304]
With man the eyes stare wildly as in horrified astonishment, or the
brows are heavily contracted. Perspiration bathes the body, and
drops trickle down the face. The circulation and respiration are much
affected. Hence the nostrils are generally dilated and often quiver; or
the breath may be held until the blood stagnates in the purple face.
If the agony be severe and prolonged, these signs all change; utter
prostration follows, with fainting or convulsions.

A sensitive nerve when irritated transmits some influence to the
nerve-cell, whence it proceeds; and this transmits its influence, first
to the corresponding nerve-cell on the opposite side of the body, and
then upwards and downwards along the cerebro-spinal column to other
nerve-cells, to a greater or less extent, according to the strength
of the excitement; so that, ultimately, the whole nervous system maybe
affected.[305] This involuntary transmission of nerve-force may or may
not be accompanied by consciousness. Why the irritation of a nerve-cell
should generate or liberate nerve-force is not known; but that this
is the case seems to be the conclusion arrived at by all the greatest
physiologists, such as Muller, Virchow, Bernard, &c.[306] As Mr. Herbert
Spencer remarks, it may be received as an "unquestionable truth that, at
any moment, the existing quantity of liberated nerve-force, which in an
inscrutable way produces in us the state we call feeling, MUST expend
itself in some direction--MUST generate an equivalent manifestation
of force somewhere;" so that, when the cerebro-spinal system is highly
excited and nerve-force is liberated in excess, it may be expended in
intense sensations, active thought, violent movements, or increased
activity of the glands.[307] Mr. Spencer further maintains that an
"overflow of nerve-force, undirected by any motive, will manifestly
take the most habitual routes; and, if these do not suffice, will next
overflow into the less habitual ones." Consequently the facial and
respiratory muscles, which are the most used, will be apt to be first
brought into action; then those of the upper extremities, next those of
the lower, and finally those of the whole body.[308]

An emotion may be very strong, but it will have little tendency to
induce movements of any kind, if it has not commonly led to voluntary
action for its relief or gratification; and when movements are excited,
their nature is, to a large extent, determined by those which have often
and voluntarily been performed for some definite end under the same
emotion. Great pain urges all animals, and has urged them during endless
generations, to make the most violent and diversified efforts to escape
from the cause of suffering. Even when a limb or other separate part of
the body is hurt, we often see a tendency to shake it, as if to shake
off the cause, though this may obviously be impossible. Thus a habit
of exerting with the utmost force all the muscles will have been
established, whenever great suffering is experienced. As the muscles
of the chest and vocal organs are habitually used, these will be
particularly liable to be acted on, and loud, harsh screams or cries
will be uttered. But the advantage derived from outcries has here
probably come into play in an important manner; for the young of most
animals, when in distress or danger, call loudly to their parents for
aid, as do the members of the same community for mutual aid.

Another principle, namely, the internal consciousness that the power
or capacity of the nervous system is limited, will have strengthened,
though in a subordinate degree, the tendency to violent action under
extreme suffering. A man cannot think deeply and exert his utmost
muscular force. As Hippocrates long ago observed, if two pains are
felt at the same time, the severer one dulls the other. Martyrs, in the
ecstasy of their religious fervour have often, as it would appear, been
insensible to the most horrid tortures. Sailors who are going to be
flogged sometimes take a piece of lead into their mouths, in order to
bite it with their utmost force, and thus to bear the pain. Parturient
women prepare to exert their muscles to the utmost in order to relieve
their sufferings.

We thus see that the undirected radiation of nerve-force from the
nerve-cells which are first affected--the long-continued habit of
attempting by struggling to escape from the cause of suffering--and the
consciousness that voluntary muscular exertion relieves pain, have all
probably concurred in giving a tendency to the most violent, almost
convulsive, movements under extreme suffering; and such movements,
including those of the vocal organs, are universally recognized as
highly expressive of this condition.

As the mere touching of a sensitive nerve reacts in a direct manner on
the heart, severe pain will obviously react on it in like manner, but
far more energetically. Nevertheless, even in this case, we must not
overlook the indirect effects of habit on the heart, as we shall see
when we consider the signs of rage.

When a man suffers from an agony of pain, the perspiration often
trickles down his face; and I have been assured by a veterinary surgeon
that he has frequently seen drops falling from the belly and running
down the inside of the thighs of horses, and from the bodies of cattle,
when thus suffering. He has observed this, when there has been no
struggling which would account for the perspiration. The whole body
of the female hippopotamus, before alluded to, was covered with
red-coloured perspiration whilst giving birth to her young. So it is
with extreme fear; the same veterinary has often seen horses sweating
from this cause; as has Mr. Bartlett with the rhinoceros; and with man
it is a well-known symptom. The cause of perspiration bursting forth in
these cases is quite obscure; but it is thought by some physiologists to
be connected with the failing power of the capillary circulation; and
we know that the vasomotor system, which regulates the capillary
circulation, is much influenced by the mind. With respect to the
movements of certain muscles of the face under great suffering, as well
as from other emotions, these will be best considered when we treat of
the special expressions of man and of the lower animals.

We will now turn to the characteristic symptoms of Rage. Under this
powerful emotion the action of the heart is much accelerated,[309] or it
may be much disturbed. The face reddens, or it becomes purple from the
impeded return of the blood, or may turn deadly pale. The respiration is
laboured, the chest heaves, and the dilated nostrils quiver. The whole
body often trembles. The voice is affected. The teeth are clenched
or ground together, and the muscular system is commonly stimulated to
violent, almost frantic action. But the gestures of a man in this state
usually differ from the purposeless writhings and struggles of one
suffering from an agony of pain; for they represent more or less plainly
the act of striking or fighting with an enemy.

All these signs of rage are probably in large part, and some of them
appear to be wholly, due to the direct action of the excited sensorium.
But animals of all kinds, and their progenitors before them, when
attacked or threatened by an enemy, have exerted their utmost powers in
fighting and in defending themselves. Unless an animal does thus act,
or has the intention, or at least the desire, to attack its enemy, it
cannot properly be said to be enraged. An inherited habit of muscular
exertion will thus have been gained in association with rage; and this
will directly or indirectly affect various organs, in nearly the same
manner as does great bodily suffering.

The heart no doubt will likewise be affected in a direct manner; but it
will also in all probability be affected through habit; and all the more
so from not being under the control of the will. We know that any
great exertion which we voluntarily make, affects the heart, through
mechanical and other principles which need not here be considered; and
it was shown in the first chapter that nerve-force flows readily
through habitually used channels,--through the nerves of voluntary
or involuntary movement, and through those of sensation. Thus even a
moderate amount of exertion will tend to act on the heart; and on the
principle of association, of which so many instances have been given,
we may feel nearly sure that any sensation or emotion, as great pain or
rage, which has habitually led to much muscular action, will immediately
influence the flow of nerve-force to the heart, although there may not
be at the time any muscular exertion.

The heart, as I have said, will be all the more readily affected through
habitual associations, as it is not under the control of the will. A man
when moderately angry, or even when enraged, may command the movements
of his body, but he cannot prevent his heart from beating rapidly. His
chest will perhaps give a few heaves, and his nostrils just quiver, for
the movements of respiration are only in part voluntary. In like manner
those muscles of the face which are least obedient to the will, will
sometimes alone betray a slight and passing emotion. The glands again
are wholly independent of the will, and a man suffering from grief may
command his features, but cannot always prevent the tears from coming
into his eyes. A hungry man, if tempting food is placed before him,
may not show his hunger by any outward gesture, but he cannot check the
secretion of saliva.

Under a transport of Joy or of vivid Pleasure, there is a strong
tendency to various purposeless movements, and to the utterance of
various sounds. We see this in our young children, in their loud
laughter, clapping of hands, and jumping for joy; in the bounding and
barking of a dog when going out to walk with his master; and in the
frisking of a horse when turned out into an open field. Joy quickens the
circulation, and this stimulates the brain, which again reacts on the
whole body. The above purposeless movements and increased heart-action
may be attributed in chief part to the excited state of the
sensorium,[310] and to the consequent undirected overflow, as Mr.
Herbert Spencer insists, of nerve-force. It deserves notice, that it is
chiefly the anticipation of a pleasure, and not its actual enjoyment,
which leads to purposeless and extravagant movements of the body, and to
the utterance of various sounds. We see this in our children when they
expect any great pleasure or treat; and dogs, which have been bounding
about at the sight of a plate of food, when they get it do not show
their delight by any outward sign, not even by wagging their tails.
Now with animals of all kinds, the acquirement of almost all their
pleasures, with the exception of those of warmth and rest, are
associated, and have long been associated with active movements, as in
the hunting or search for food, and in their courtship. Moreover, the
mere exertion of the muscles after long rest or confinement is in itself
a pleasure, as we ourselves feel, and as we see in the play of young
animals. Therefore on this latter principle alone we might perhaps
expect, that vivid pleasure would be apt to show itself conversely in
muscular movements.

With all or almost all animals, even with birds, Terror causes the
body to tremble. The skin becomes pale, sweat breaks out, and the hair
bristles. The secretions of the alimentary canal and of the kidneys are
increased, and they are involuntarily voided, owing to the relaxation
of the sphincter muscles, as is known to be the case with man, and as
I have seen with cattle, dogs, cats, and monkeys. The breathing is
hurried. The heart beats quickly, wildly, and violently; but whether it
pumps the blood more efficiently through the body may be doubted, for
the surface seems bloodless and the strength of the muscles soon fails.
In a frightened horse I have felt through the saddle the beating of
the heart so plainly that I could have counted the beats. The mental
faculties are much disturbed. Utter prostration soon follows, and even
fainting. A terrified canary-bird has been seen not only to tremble and
to turn white about the base of the bill, but to faint;[311] and I once
caught a robin in a room, which fainted so completely, that for a time I
thought it dead.

Most of these symptoms are probably the direct result, independently
of habit, of the disturbed state of the sensorium; but it is doubtful
whether they ought to be wholly thus accounted for. When an animal is
alarmed it almost always stands motionless for a moment, in order to
collect its senses and to ascertain the source of danger, and sometimes
for the sake of escaping detection. But headlong flight soon follows,
with no husbanding of the strength as in fighting, and the animal
continues to fly as long as the danger lasts, until utter prostration,
with failing respiration and circulation, with all the muscles quivering
and profuse sweating, renders further flight impossible. Hence it does
not seem improbable that the principle of associated habit may in part
account for, or at least augment, some of the above-named characteristic
symptoms of extreme terror.


That the principle of associated habit has played an important part
in causing the movements expressive of the foregoing several strong
emotions and sensations, we may, I think, conclude from considering
firstly, some other strong emotions which do not ordinarily require for
their relief or gratification any voluntary movement; and secondly the
contrast in nature between the so-called exciting and depressing states
of the mind. No emotion is stronger than maternal love; but a mother may
feel the deepest love for her helpless infant, and yet not show it by
any outward sign; or only by slight caressing movements, with a gentle
smile and tender eyes. But let any one intentionally injure her infant,
and see what a change! how she starts up with threatening aspect, how
her eyes sparkle and her face reddens, how her bosom heaves, nostrils
dilate, and heart beats; for anger, and not maternal love, has
habitually led to action. The love between the opposite sexes is widely
different from maternal love; and when lovers meet, we know that their
hearts beat quickly, their breathing is hurried, and their faces flush;
for this love is not inactive like that of a mother for her infant.

A man may have his mind filled with the blackest hatred or suspicion, or
be corroded with envy or jealousy, but as these feelings do not at once
lead to action, and as they commonly last for some time, they are not
shown by any outward sign, excepting that a man in this state assuredly
does not appear cheerful or good-tempered. If indeed these feelings
break out into overt acts, rage takes their place, and will be plainly
exhibited. Painters can hardly portray suspicion, jealousy, envy, &c.,
except by the aid of accessories which tell the tale; and poets use
such vague and fanciful expressions as "green-eyed jealousy." Spenser
describes suspicion as "Foul, ill-favoured, and grim, under his eyebrows
looking still askance," &c.; Shakespeare speaks of envy "as lean-faced
in her loathsome case;" and in another place he says, "no black envy
shall make my grave;" and again as "above pale envy's threatening
reach."

Emotions and sensations have often been classed as exciting or
depressing. When all the organs of the body and mind,--those of
voluntary and involuntary movement, of perception, sensation, thought,
&c.,--perform their functions more energetically and rapidly than usual,
a man or animal may be said to be excited, and, under an opposite state,
to be depressed. Anger and joy are from the first exciting emotions, and
they naturally lead, more especially the former, to energetic movements,
which react on the heart and this again on the brain. A physician once
remarked to me as a proof of the exciting nature of anger, that a man
when excessively jaded will sometimes invent imaginary offences and put
himself into a passion, unconsciously for the sake of reinvigorating
himself; and since hearing this remark, I have occasionally recognized
its full truth.

Several other states of mind appear to be at first exciting, but soon
become depressing to an extreme degree. When a mother suddenly loses her
child, sometimes she is frantic with grief, and must be considered to be
in an excited state; she walks wildly about, tears her hair or clothes,
and wrings her hands. This latter action is perhaps due to the principle
of antithesis, betraying an inward sense of helplessness and that
nothing can be done. The other wild and violent movements may be in part
explained by the relief experienced through muscular exertion, and
in part by the undirected overflow of nerve-force from the excited
sensorium. But under the sudden loss of a beloved person, one of the
first and commonest thoughts which occurs, is that something more might
have been done to save the lost one. An excellent observer,[312] in
describing the behaviour of a girl at the sudden death of her father,
says she "went about the house wringing her hands like a creature
demented, saying 'It was her fault;' 'I should never have left him;'
'If I had only sat up with him,'" &c. With such ideas vividly present
before the mind, there would arise, through the principle of associated
habit, the strongest tendency to energetic action of some kind.

As soon as the sufferer is fully conscious that nothing can be done,
despair or deep sorrow takes the place of frantic grief. The sufferer
sits motionless, or gently rocks to and fro; the circulation becomes
languid; respiration is almost forgotten, and deep sighs are drawn.

Pain, if severe, soon induces extreme depression or prostration; but it
is at first a stimulant and excites to action, as we see when we whip a
horse, and as is shown by the horrid tortures inflicted in foreign lands
on exhausted dray-bullocks, to rouse them to renewed exertion. Fear
again is the most depressing of all the emotions; and it soon induces
utter, helpless prostration, as if in consequence of, or in association
with, the most violent and prolonged attempts to escape from the danger,
though no such attempts have actually been made. Nevertheless, even
extreme fear often acts at first as a powerful stimulant. A man or
animal driven through terror to desperation, is endowed with wonderful
strength, and is notoriously dangerous in the highest degree.

On the whole we may conclude that the principle of the direct action
of the sensorium on the body, due to the constitution of the nervous
system, and from the first independent of the will, has been highly
influential in determining many expressions. Good instances are afforded
by the trembling of the muscles, the sweating of the skin, the modified
secretions of the alimentary canal and glands, under various emotions
and sensations. But actions of this kind are often combined with others,
which follow from our first principle, namely, that actions which have
often been of direct or indirect service, under certain states of the
mind, in order to gratify or relieve certain sensations, desires, &c.,
are still performed under analogous circumstances through mere habit
although of no service. We have combinations of this kind, at least in
part, in the frantic gestures of rage and in the writhings of extreme
pain; and, perhaps, in the increased action of the heart and of the
respiratory organs. Even when these and other emotions or sensations
are aroused in a very feeble manner, there will still be a tendency to
similar actions, owing to the force of long-associated habit; and
those actions which are least under voluntary control will generally
be longest retained. Our second principle of antithesis has likewise
occasionally come into play.

Finally, so many expressive movements can be explained, as I trust will
be seen in the course of this volume, through the three principles which
have now been discussed, that we may hope hereafter to see all thus
explained, or by closely analogous principles. It is, however, often
impossible to decide how much weight ought to be attributed, in each
particular case, to one of our principles, and how much to another; and
very many points in the theory of Expression remain inexplicable.



CHAPTER IV. -- MEANS OF EXPRESSION IN ANIMALS.

The emission of Sounds--Vocal sounds--Sounds otherwise
produced--Erection of the dermal appendages, hairs, feathers, &c., under
the emotions of anger and terror--The drawing back of the ears as a
preparation for fighting, and as an expression of anger--Erection of the
ears and raising the head, a sign of attention.


IN this and the following chapter I will describe, but only in
sufficient detail to illustrate my subject, the expressive movements,
under different states of the mind, of some few well-known animals. But
before considering them in due succession, it will save much useless
repetition to discuss certain means of expression common to most of
them.

_The emission of Sounds_.--With many kinds of animals, man included,
the vocal organs are efficient in the highest degree as a means of
expression. We have seen, in the last chapter, that when the sensorium
is strongly excited, the muscles of the body are generally thrown into
violent action; and as a consequence, loud sounds are uttered, however
silent the animal may generally be, and although the sounds may be of no
use. Hares and rabbits for instance, never, I believe, use their vocal
organs except in the extremity of suffering; as, when a wounded hare is
killed by the sportsman, or when a young rabbit is caught by a stoat.
Cattle and horses suffer great pain in silence; but when this is
excessive, and especially when associated with terror, they utter
fearful sounds. I have often recognized, from a distance on the Pampas,
the agonized death-bellow of the cattle, when caught by the lasso and
hamstrung. It is said that horses, when attacked by wolves, utter loud
and peculiar screams of distress.

Involuntary and purposeless contractions of the muscles of the chest and
glottis, excited in the above manner, may have first given rise to the
emission of vocal sounds. But the voice is now largely used by many
animals for various purposes; and habit seems to have played an
important part in its employment under other circumstances. Naturalists
have remarked, I believe with truth, that social animals, from
habitually using their vocal organs as a means of intercommunication,
use them on other occasions much more freely than other animals. But
there are marked exceptions to this rule, for instance, with the rabbit.
The principle, also, of association, which is so widely extended in its
power, has likewise played its part. Hence it follows that the voice,
from having been habitually employed as a serviceable aid under certain
conditions, inducing pleasure, pain, rage, &c., is commonly used
whenever the same sensations or emotions are excited, under quite
different conditions, or in a lesser degree.

The sexes of many animals incessantly call for each other during the
breeding-season; and in not a few cases, the male endeavours thus
to charm or excite the female. This, indeed, seems to have been the
primeval use and means of development of the voice, as I have attempted
to show in my 'Descent of Man.' Thus the use of the vocal organs will
have become associated with the anticipation of the strongest pleasure
which animals are capable of feeling. Animals which live in society
often call to each other when separated, and evidently feel much joy
at meeting; as we see with a horse, on the return of his companion, for
whom he has been neighing. The mother calls incessantly for her lost
young ones; for instance, a cow for her calf; and the young of many
animals call for their mothers. When a flock of sheep is scattered, the
ewes bleat incessantly for their lambs, and their mutual pleasure at
coming together is manifest. Woe betide the man who meddles with the
young of the larger and fiercer quadrupeds, if they hear the cry of
distress from their young. Rage leads to the violent exertion of all the
muscles, including those of the voice; and some animals, when enraged,
endeavour to strike terror into their enemies by its power and
harshness, as the lion does by roaring, and the dog by growling. I infer
that their object is to strike terror, because the lion at the same time
erects the hair of its mane, and the dog the hair along its back, and
thus they make themselves appear as large and terrible as possible.
Rival males try to excel and challenge each other by their voices,
and this leads to deadly contests. Thus the use of the voice will have
become associated with the emotion of anger, however it may be aroused.
We have also seen that intense pain, like rage, leads to violent
outcries, and the exertion of screaming by itself gives some relief; and
thus the use of the voice will have become associated with suffering of
any kind.

The cause of widely different sounds being uttered under different
emotions and sensations is a very obscure subject. Nor does the rule
always hold good that there is any marked difference. For instance with
the dog, the bark of anger and that of joy do not differ much,
though they can be distinguished. It is not probable that any precise
explanation of the cause or source of each particular sound, under
different states of the mind, will ever be given. We now that some
animals, after being domesticated, have acquired the habit of uttering
sounds which were not natural to them.[401] Thus domestic dogs, and even
tamed jackals, have learnt to bark, which is a noise not proper to any
species of the genus, with the exception of the _Canis latrans_ of
North America, which is said to bark. Some breeds, also, of the domestic
pigeon have learnt to coo in a new and quite peculiar manner.

The character of the human voice, under the influence of various
emotions, has been discussed by Mr. Herbert Spencer[402] in his
interesting essay on Music. He clearly shows that the voice alters much
under different conditions, in loudness and in quality, that is, in
resonance and _timbre_, in pitch and intervals. No one can listen to an
eloquent orator or preacher, or to a man calling angrily to another, or
to one expressing astonishment, without being struck with the truth of
Mr. Spencer's remarks. It is curious how early in life the modulation of
the voice becomes expressive. With one of my children, under the age of
two years, I clearly perceived that his humph of assent was rendered by
a slight modulation strongly emphatic; and that by a peculiar whine his
negative expressed obstinate determination. Mr. Spencer further shows
that emotional speech, in all the above respects is intimately related
to vocal music, and consequently to instrumental music; and he attempts
to explain the characteristic qualities of both on physiological
grounds--namely, on "the general law that a feeling is a stimulus to
muscular action." It may be admitted that the voice is affected through
this law; but the explanation appears to me too general and vague to
throw much light on the various differences, with the exception of that
of loudness, between ordinary speech and emotional speech, or singing.

This remark holds good, whether we believe that the various qualities
of the voice originated in speaking under the excitement of strong
feelings, and that these qualities have subsequently been transferred
to vocal music; or whether we believe, as I maintain, that the habit of
uttering musical sounds was first developed, as a means of courtship,
in the early progenitors of man, and thus became associated with the
strongest emotions of which they were capable,--namely, ardent love,
rivalry and triumph. That animals utter musical notes is familiar to
every one, as we may daily hear in the singing of birds. It is a more
remarkable fact that an ape, one of the Gibbons, produces an exact
octave of musical sounds, ascending and descending the scale by
halftones; so that this monkey "alone of brute mammals may be said to
sing."[403] From this fact, and from the analogy of other animals, I
have been led to infer that the progenitors of man probably uttered
musical tones, before they had acquired the power of articulate speech;
and that consequently, when the voice is used under any strong emotion,
it tends to assume, through the principle of association, a musical
character. We can plainly perceive, with some of the lower animals,
that the males employ their voices to please the females, and that
they themselves take pleasure in their own vocal utterances; but why
particular sounds are uttered, and why these give pleasure cannot at
present be explained.

That the pitch of the voice bears some relation to certain states
of feeling is tolerably clear. A person gently complaining of
ill-treatment, or slightly suffering, almost always speaks in a
high-pitched voice. Dogs, when a little impatient, often make a
high piping note through their noses, which at once strikes us as
plaintive;[404] but how difficult it is to know whether the sound is
essentially plaintive, or only appears so in this particular case, from
our having learnt by experience what it means! Rengger, states[405]
that the monkeys (_Cebus azaroe_), which he kept in Paraguay, expressed
astonishment by a half-piping, half-snarling noise; anger or impatience,
by repeating the sound _hu hu_ in a deeper, grunting voice; and fright
or pain, by shrill screams. On the other hand, with mankind, deep groans
and high piercing screams equally express an agony of pain. Laughter
maybe either high or low; so that, with adult men, as Haller long ago
remarked,[406] the sound partakes of the character of the vowels (as
pronounced in German) _O_ and _A_; whilst with children and women, it
has more of the character of _E_ and _I_; and these latter vowel-sounds
naturally have, as Helmholtz has shown, a higher pitch than the former;
yet both tones of laughter equally express enjoyment or amusement.

In considering the mode in which vocal utterances express emotion,
we are naturally led to inquire into the cause of what is called
"expression" in music. Upon this point Mr. Litchfield, who has long
attended to the subject of music, has been so kind as to give me the
following remarks:--"The question, what is the essence of musical
'expression' involves a number of obscure points, which, so far as I am
aware, are as yet unsolved enigmas. Up to a certain point, however,
any law which is found to hold as to the expression of the emotions by
simple sounds must apply to the more developed mode of expression in
song, which may be taken as the primary type of all music. A great part
of the emotional effect of a song depends on the character of the action
by which the sounds are produced. In songs, for instance, which express
great vehemence of passion, the effect often chiefly depends on the
forcible utterance of some one or two characteristic passages which
demand great exertion of vocal force; and it will be frequently noticed
that a song of this character fails of its proper effect when sung by a
voice of sufficient power and range to give the characteristic passages
without much exertion. This is, no doubt, the secret of the loss of
effect so often produced by the transposition of a song from one key
to another. The effect is thus seen to depend not merely on the actual
sounds, but also in part on the nature of the action which produces the
sounds. Indeed it is obvious that whenever we feel the 'expression' of
a song to be due to its quickness or slowness of movement--to smoothness
of flow, loudness of utterance, and so on--we are, in fact, interpreting
the muscular actions which produce sound, in the same way in which we
interpret muscular action generally. But this leaves unexplained
the more subtle and more specific effect which we call the MUSICAL
expression of the song--the delight given by its melody, or even by the
separate sounds which make up the melody. This is an effect indefinable
in language--one which, so far as I am aware, no one has been able to
analyse, and which the ingenious speculation of Mr. Herbert Spencer as
to the origin of music leaves quite unexplained. For it is certain that
the MELODIC effect of a series of sounds does not depend in the least on
their loudness or softness, or on their ABSOLUTE pitch. A tune is always
the same tune, whether it is sung loudly or softly, by a child or a man;
whether it is played on a flute or on a trombone. The purely musical
effect of any sound depends on its place in what is technically called
a 'scale;' the same sound producing absolutely different effects on the
ear, according as it is heard in connection with one or another series
of sounds.

"It is on this RELATIVE association of the sounds that all the
essentially characteristic effects which are summed up in the phrase
'musical expression,' depend. But why certain associations of sounds
have such-and-such effects, is a problem which yet remains to be solved.
These effects must indeed, in some way or other, be connected with the
well-known arithmetical relations between the rates of vibration of
the sounds which form a musical scale. And it is possible--but this is
merely a suggestion--that the greater or less mechanical facility with
which the vibrating apparatus of the human larynx passes from one state
of vibration to another, may have been a primary cause of the greater or
less pleasure produced by various sequences of sounds."

But leaving aside these complex questions and confining ourselves to the
simpler sounds, we can, at least, see some reasons for the association
of certain kinds of sounds with certain states of mind. A scream, for
instance, uttered by a young animal, or by one of the members of a
community, as a call for assistance, will naturally be loud, prolonged,
and high, so as to penetrate to a distance. For Helmholtz has shown[407]
that, owing to the shape of the internal cavity of the human ear and its
consequent power of resonance, high notes produce a particularly strong
impression. When male animals utter sounds in order to please the
females, they would naturally employ those which are sweet to the ears
of the species; and it appears that the same sounds are often pleasing
to widely different animals, owing to the similarity of their nervous
systems, as we ourselves perceive in the singing of birds and even in
the chirping of certain tree-frogs giving us pleasure. On the other
hand, sounds produced in order to strike terror into an enemy, would
naturally be harsh or displeasing.

Whether the principle of antithesis has come into play with sounds, as
might perhaps have been expected, is doubtful. The interrupted, laughing
or tittering sounds made by man and by various kinds of monkeys when
pleased, are as different as possible from the prolonged screams of
these animals when distressed. The deep grunt of satisfaction uttered
by a pig, when pleased with its food, is widely different from its harsh
scream of pain or terror. But with the dog, as lately remarked, the
bark of anger and that of joy are sounds which by no means stand in
opposition to each other; and so it is in some other cases.

There is another obscure point, namely, whether the sounds which are
produced under various states of the mind determine the shape of the
mouth, or whether its shape is not determined by independent causes, and
the sound thus modified. When young infants cry they open their mouths
widely, and this, no doubt, is necessary for pouring forth a full volume
of sound; but the mouth then assumes, from a quite distinct cause, an
almost quadrangular shape, depending, as will hereafter be explained, on
the firm closing of the eyelids, and consequent drawing up of the upper
lip. How far this square shape of the mouth modifies the wailing or
crying sound, I am not prepared to say; but we know from the researches
of Helmholtz and others that the form of the cavity of the mouth and
lips determines the nature and pitch of the vowel sounds which are
produced.

It will also be shown in a future chapter that, under the feeling of
contempt or disgust, there is a tendency, from intelligible causes, to
blow out of the mouth or nostrils, and this produces sounds like pooh
or pish. When any one is startled or suddenly astonished, there is an
instantaneous tendency, likewise from an intelligible cause, namely, to
be ready for prolonged exertion, to open the mouth widely, so as to draw
a deep and rapid inspiration. When the next full expiration follows,
the mouth is slightly closed, and the lips, from causes hereafter to be
discussed, are somewhat protruded; and this form of the mouth, if the
voice be at all exerted, produces, according to Helmholtz, the sound of
the vowel _O_. Certainly a deep sound of a prolonged _Oh!_ may be
heard from a whole crowd of people immediately after witnessing any
astonishing spectacle. If, together with surprise, pain be felt, there
is a tendency to contract all the muscles of the body, including those
of the face, and the lips will then be drawn back; and this will perhaps
account for the sound becoming higher and assuming the character of
_Ah!_ or _Ach!_ As fear causes all the muscles of the body to tremble,
the voice naturally becomes tremulous, and at the same time husky from
the dryness of the mouth, owing to the salivary glands failing to act.
Why the laughter of man and the tittering of monkeys should be a rapidly
reiterated sound, cannot be explained. During the utterance of these
sounds, the mouth is transversely elongated by the corners being drawn
backwards and upwards; and of this fact an explanation will be attempted
in a future chapter. But the whole subject of the differences of the
sounds produced under different states of the mind is so obscure, that I
have succeeded in throwing hardly any light on it; and the remarks which
I have made, have but little significance.

[Illustration: Sound producing quills from tail of a porcupine. Fig. 11]

All the sounds hitherto noticed depend on the respiratory organs; but
sounds produced by wholly different means are likewise expressive.
Rabbits stamp loudly on the ground as a signal to their comrades; and
if a man knows how to do so properly, he may on a quiet evening hear the
rabbits answering him all around. These animals, as well as some others,
also stamp on the ground when made angry. Porcupines rattle their quills
and vibrate their tails when angered; and one behaved in this manner
when a live snake was placed in its compartment. The quills
on the tail are very different from those on the body: they are short,
hollow, thin like a goose-quill, with their ends transversely truncated,
so that they are open; they are supported on long, thin, elastic
foot-stalks. Now, when the tail is rapidly shaken, these hollow quills
strike against each other and produce, as I heard in the presence of Mr.
Bartlett, a peculiar continuous sound. We can, I think, understand
why porcupines have been provided, through the modification of their
protective spines, with this special sound-producing instrument. They
are nocturnal animals, and if they scented or heard a prowling beast of
prey, it would be a great advantage to them in the dark to give warning
to their enemy what they were, and that they were furnished with
dangerous spines. They would thus escape being attacked. They are, as
I may add, so fully conscious of the power of their weapons, that when
enraged they will charge backwards with their spines erected, yet still
inclined backwards.

Many birds during their courtship produce diversified sounds by means of
specially adapted feathers. Storks, when excited, make a loud clattering
noise with their beaks. Some snakes produce a grating or rattling noise.
Many insects stridulate by rubbing together specially modified parts of
their hard integuments. This stridulation generally serves as a
sexual charm or call; but it is likewise used to express different
emotions.[408] Every one who has attended to bees knows that their
humming changes when they are angry; and this serves as a warning that
there is danger of being stung. I have made these few remarks because
some writers have laid so much stress on the vocal and respiratory
organs as having been specially adapted for expression, that it was
advisable to show that sounds otherwise produced serve equally well for
the same purpose.

_Erection of the dermal appendages_.--Hardly any expressive movement is
so general as the involuntary erection of the hairs, feathers and
other dermal appendages; for it is common throughout three of the great
vertebrate classes. These appendages are erected under the excitement
of anger or terror; more especially when these emotions are combined, or
quickly succeed each other. The action serves to make the animal appear
larger and more frightful to its enemies or rivals, and is generally
accompanied by various voluntary movements adapted for the same purpose,
and by the utterance of savage sounds. Mr. Bartlett, who has had such
wide experience with animals of all kinds, does not doubt that this is
the case; but it is a different question whether the power of erection
was primarily acquired for this special purpose.

I will first give a considerable body of facts showing how general this
action is with mammals, birds and reptiles; retaining what I have to
say in regard to man for a future chapter. Mr. Sutton, the intelligent
keeper in the Zoological Gardens, carefully observed for me the
Chimpanzee and Orang; and he states that when they are suddenly
frightened, as by a thunderstorm, or when they are made angry, as by
being teased, their hair becomes erect. I saw a chimpanzee who was
alarmed at the sight of a black coalheaver, and the hair rose all over
his body; he made little starts forward as if to attack the man,
without any real intention of doing so, but with the hope, as the keeper
remarked, of frightening him. The Gorilla, when enraged, is described by
Mr. Ford[409] as having his crest of hair "erect and projecting forward,
his nostrils dilated, and his under lip thrown down; at the same time
uttering his characteristic yell, designed, it would seem, to terrify
his antagonists." I saw the hair on the Anubis baboon, when angered
bristling along the back, from the neck to the loins, but not on
the rump or other parts of the body. I took a stuffed snake into the
monkey-house, and the hair on several of the species instantly became
erect; especially on their tails, as I particularly noticed with the
_Cereopithecus nictitans_. Brehm states[410] that the _Midas aedipus_
(belonging to the American division) when excited erects its mane, in
order, as he adds, to make itself as frightful as possible.

With the Carnivora the erection of the hair seems to be almost
universal, often accompanied by threatening movements, the uncovering of
the teeth and the utterance of savage growls. In the Herpestes, I have
seen the hair on end over nearly the whole body, including the tail; and
the dorsal crest is erected in a conspicuous manner by the Hyaena and
Proteles. The enraged lion erects his mane. The bristling of the hair
along the neck and back of the dog, and over the whole body of the
cat, especially on the tail, is familiar to every one. With the cat it
apparently occurs only under fear; with the dog, under anger and fear;
but not, as far as I have observed, under abject fear, as when a dog is
going to be flogged by a severe gamekeeper. If, however, the dog shows
fight, as sometimes happens, up goes his hair. I have often noticed that
the hair of a dog is particularly liable to rise, if he is half angry
and half afraid, as on beholding some object only indistinctly seen in
the dusk.

I have been assured by a veterinary surgeon that he has often seen the
hair erected on horses and cattle, on which he had operated and was
again going to operate. When I showed a stuffed snake to a Peccary, the
hair rose in a wonderful manner along its back; and so it does with
the boar when enraged. An Elk which gored a man to death in the United
States, is described as first brandishing his antlers, squealing with
rage and stamping on the ground; "at length his hair was seen to rise
and stand on end," and then he plunged forward to the attack.[411] The
hair likewise becomes erect on goats, and, as I hear from Mr. Blyth, on
some Indian antelopes. I have seen it erected on the hairy Ant-eater;
and on the Agouti, one of the Rodents. A female Bat,[412] which reared
her young under confinement, when any one looked into the cage "erected
the fur on her back, and bit viciously at intruding fingers."

Birds belonging to all the chief Orders ruffle their feathers when angry
or frightened. Every one must have seen two cocks, even quite young
birds, preparing to fight with erected neck-hackles; nor can these
feathers when erected serve as a means of defence, for cock-fighters
have found by experience that it is advantageous to trim them. The male
Ruff (_Machetes pugnax_) likewise erects its collar of feathers when
fighting. When a dog approaches a common hen with her chickens, she
spreads out her wings, raises her tail, ruffles all her feathers, and
looking as ferocious as possible, dashes at the intruder. The tail is
not always held in exactly the same position; it is sometimes so much
erected, that the central feathers, as in the accompanying drawing,
almost touch the back. Swans, when angered, likewise raise their wings
and tail, and erect their feathers. They open their beaks, and make by
paddling little rapid starts forwards, against any one who approaches
the water's edge too closely. Tropic birds[413] when disturbed on their
nests are said not to fly away, but "merely to stick out their feathers
and scream." The Barn-owl, when approached "instantly swells out its
plumage, extends its wings and tail, hisses and clacks its mandibles
with force and rapidity."[414] So do other kinds of owls. Hawks, as I am
informed by Mr. Jenner Weir, likewise ruffle their feathers, and spread
out their wings and tail under similar circumstances. Some kinds of
parrots erect their feathers; and I have seen this action in the
Cassowary, when angered at the sight of an Ant-eater. Young cuckoos in
the nest, raise their feathers, open their mouths widely, and make
themselves as frightful as possible.

[Illustration: Swan driving away an intruder. Fig 13]

{illust. caption = FIG. 13.--Swan driving away an intruder. Drawn from
life by Mr. Wood.}

Small birds, also, as I hear from Mr. Weir, such as various finches,
buntings and warblers, when angry, ruffle all their feathers, or only
those round the neck; or they spread out their wings and tail-feathers.
With their plumage in this state, they rush at each other with open
beaks and threatening gestures. Mr. Weir concludes from his large
experience that the erection of the feathers is caused much more by
anger than by fear. He gives as an instance a hybrid goldfinch of a most
irascible disposition, which when approached too closely by a servant,
instantly assumes the appearance of a ball of ruffled feathers. He
believes that birds when frightened, as a general rule, closely adpress
all their feathers, and their consequently diminished size is often
astonishing. As soon as they recover from their fear or surprise, the
first thing which they do is to shake out their feathers. The best
instances of this adpression of the feathers and apparent shrinking of
the body from fear, which Mr. Weir has noticed, has been in the quail
and grass-parrakeet.[415] The habit is intelligible in these birds from
their being accustomed, when in danger, either to squat on the ground or
to sit motionless on a branch, so as to escape detection. Though, with
birds, anger may be the chief and commonest cause of the erection of the
feathers, it is probable that young cuckoos when looked at in the nest,
and a hen with her chickens when approached by a dog, feel at least some
terror. Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that with game-cocks, the erection of
the feathers on the head has long been recognized in the cock-pit as a
sign of cowardice.

The males of some lizards, when fighting together during their
courtship, expand their throat pouches or frills, and erect their dorsal
crests.[416] But Dr. Gunther does not believe that they can erect their
separate spines or scales.

We thus see how generally throughout the two higher vertebrate classes,
and with some reptiles, the dermal appendages are erected under the
influence of anger and fear. The movement is effected, as we know
from Kolliker's interesting discovery, by the contraction of minute,
unstriped, involuntary muscles,[417] often called _arrectores pili_,
which are attached to the capsules of the separate hairs, feathers, &c.
By the contraction of these muscles the hairs can be instantly erected,
as we see in a dog, being at the same time drawn a little out of their
sockets; they are afterwards quickly depressed. The vast number of these
minute muscles over the whole body of a hairy quadruped is astonishing.
The erection of the hair is, however, aided in some cases, as with
that on the head of a man, by the striped and voluntary muscles of the
underlying _panniculus carnosus_. It is by the action of these latter
muscles, that the hedgehog erects its spines. It appears, also, from the
researches of Leydig[418] and others, that striped fibres extend from
the panniculus to some of the larger hairs, such as the vibrissae of
certain quadrupeds. The _arrectores pili_ contract not only under the
above emotions, but from the application of cold to the surface.
I remember that my mules and dogs, brought from a lower and warmer
country, after spending a night on the bleak Cordillera, had the hair
all over their bodies as erect as under the greatest terror. We see the
same action in our own _goose-skin_ during the chill before a fever-fit.
Mr. Lister has also found,[419] that tickling a neighbouring part of the
skin causes the erection and protrusion of the hairs.

From these facts it is manifest that the erection of the dermal
appendages is a reflex action, independent of the will; and this action
must be looked at, when, occurring under the influence of anger or
fear, not as a power acquired for the sake of some advantage, but as an
incidental result, at least to a large extent, of the sensorium being
affected. The result, in as far as it is incidental, may be compared
with the profuse sweating from an agony of pain or terror. Nevertheless,
it is remarkable how slight an excitement often suffices to cause the
hair to become erect; as when two dogs pretend to fight together in
play. We have, also, seen in a large number of animals, belonging to
widely distinct classes, that the erection of the hair or feathers is
almost always accompanied by various voluntary movements--by threatening
gestures, opening the mouth, uncovering the teeth, spreading out of the
wings and tail by birds, and by the utterance of harsh sounds; and the
purpose of these voluntary movements is unmistakable. Therefore it seems
hardly credible that the co-ordinated erection of the dermal appendages,
by which the animal is made to appear larger and more terrible to its
enemies or rivals, should be altogether an incidental and purposeless
result of the disturbance of the sensorium. This seems almost as
incredible as that the erection by the hedgehog of its spines, or of
the quills by the porcupine, or of the ornamental plumes by many birds
during their courtship, should all be purposeless actions.

We here encounter a great difficulty. How can the contraction of the
unstriped and involuntary _arrectores pili_ have been co-ordinated with
that of various voluntary muscles for the same special purpose? If
we could believe that the arrectores primordially had been voluntary
muscles, and had since lost their stripes and become involuntary, the
case would be comparatively simple. I am not, however, aware that there
is any evidence in favour of this view; although the reversed transition
would not have presented any great difficulty, as the voluntary muscles
are in an unstriped condition in the embryos of the higher animals, and
in the larvae of some crustaceans. Moreover in the deeper layers of the
skin of adult birds, the muscular network is, according to Leydig,[420]
in a transitional condition; the fibres exhibiting only indications of
transverse striation.

Another explanation seems possible. We may admit that originally the
_arrectores pili_ were slightly acted on in a direct manner, under the
influence of rage and terror, by the disturbance of the nervous system;
as is undoubtedly the case with our so-called _goose-skin_ before a
fever-fit. Animals have been repeatedly excited by rage and terror
during many generations; and consequently the direct effects of the
disturbed nervous system on the dermal appendages will almost
certainly have been increased through habit and through the tendency
of nerve-force to pass readily along accustomed channels. We shall
find this view of the force of habit strikingly confirmed in a future
chapter, where it will be shown that the hair of the insane is affected
in an extraordinary manner, owing to their repeated accesses of fury
and terror. As soon as with animals the power of erection had thus
been strengthened or increased, they must often have seen the hairs
or feathers erected in rival and enraged males, and the bulk of their
bodies thus increased. In this case it appears possible that they might
have wished to make themselves appear larger and more terrible to their
enemies, by voluntarily assuming a threatening attitude and uttering
harsh cries; such attitudes and utterances after a time becoming through
habit instinctive. In this manner actions performed by the contraction
of voluntary muscles might have been combined for the same special
purpose with those effected by involuntary muscles. It is even possible
that animals, when excited and dimly conscious of some change in the
state of their hair, might act on it by repeated exertions of their
attention and will; for we have reason to believe that the will is
able to influence in an obscure manner the action of some unstriped or
involuntary muscles, as in the period of the peristaltic movements
of the intestines, and in the contraction of the bladder. Nor must we
overlook the part which variation and natural selection may have played;
for the males which succeeded in making themselves appear the most
terrible to their rivals, or to their other enemies, if not of
overwhelming power, will on an average have left more offspring to
inherit their characteristic qualities, whatever these may be and
however first acquired, than have other males.

_The inflation of the body, and other means of exciting fear in an
enemy_.--Certain Amphibians and Reptiles, which either have no spines
to erect, or no muscles by which they can be erected, enlarge themselves
when alarmed or angry by inhaling air. This is well known to be the case
with toads and frogs. The latter animal is made, in AEsop's fable of
the 'Ox and the Frog,' to blow itself up from vanity and envy until
it burst. This action must have been observed during the most ancient
times, as, according to Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood,[421] the word _toad_
expresses in all the languages of Europe the habit of swelling. It has
been observed with some of the exotic species in the Zoological Gardens;
and Dr. Gunther believes that it is general throughout the group.
Judging from analogy, the primary purpose probably was to make the body
appear as large and frightful as possible to an enemy; but another, and
perhaps more important secondary advantage is thus gained. When frogs
are seized by snakes, which are their chief enemies, they enlarge
themselves wonderfully; so that if the snake be of small size, as Dr.
Gunther informs me, it cannot swallow the frog, which thus escapes being
devoured.

Chameleons and some other lizards inflate themselves when angry. Thus
a species inhabiting Oregon, the _Tapaya Douglasii_, is slow in its
movements and does not bite, but has a ferocious aspect; "when irritated
it springs in a most threatening manner at anything pointed at it, at
the same time opening its mouth wide and hissing audibly, after which it
inflates its body, and shows other marks of anger."[422]

Several kinds of snakes likewise inflate themselves when irritated.
The puff-adder (_Clotho arietans_) is remarkable in this respect; but
I believe, after carefully watching these animals, that they do not
act thus for the sake of increasing their apparent bulk, but simply
for inhaling a large supply of air, so as to produce their surprisingly
loud, harsh, and prolonged hissing sound. The Cobras-de-capello, when
irritated, enlarge themselves a little, and hiss moderately; but, at
the same time they lift their heads aloft, and dilate by means of their
elongated anterior ribs, the skin on each side of the neck into a large
flat disk,--the so-called hood. With their widely opened mouths, they
then assume a terrific aspect. The benefit thus derived ought to be
considerable, in order to compensate for the somewhat lessened rapidity
(though this is still great) with which, when dilated, they can strike
at their enemies or prey; on the same principle that a broad, thin piece
of wood cannot be moved through the air so quickly as a small round
stick. An innocuous snake, the _Trovidonotus macrophthalmus_, an
inhabitant of India, likewise dilates its neck when irritated;
and consequently is often mistaken for its compatriot, the deadly
Cobra.[423] This resemblance perhaps serves as some protection to the
Tropidonotus.

Another innocuous species, the Dasypeltis of South Africa, blows itself
out, distends its neck, hisses and darts at an intruder.[424] Many other
snakes hiss under similar circumstances. They also rapidly vibrate
their protruded tongues; and this may aid in increasing their terrific
appearance.

Snakes possess other means of producing sounds besides hissing. Many
years ago I observed in South America that a venomous Trigonocephalus,
when disturbed, rapidly vibrated the end of its tail, which striking
against the dry grass and twigs produced a rattling noise that could be
distinctly heard at the distance of six feet.[425] The deadly and fierce
_Echis carinata_ of India produces "a curious prolonged, almost hissing
sound in a very different manner, namely by rubbing the sides of the
folds of its body against each other," whilst the head remains in almost
the same position. The scales on the sides, and not on other parts of
the body, are strongly keeled, with the keels toothed like a saw; and as
the coiled-up animal rubs its sides together, these grate against each
other.[426] Lastly, we have the well-known case of the Rattle-snake. He
who has merely shaken the rattle of a dead snake, can form no just idea
of the sound produced by the living animal. Professor Shaler states that
it is indistinguishable from that made by the male of a large Cicada
(an Homopterous insect), which inhabits the same district.[427] In the
Zoological Gardens, when the rattle-snakes and puff-adders were greatly
excited at the same time, I was much struck at the similarity of the
sound produced by them; and although that made by the rattle-snake
is louder and shriller than the hissing of the puff-adder, yet when
standing at some yards distance I could scarcely distinguish the two.
For whatever purpose the sound is produced by the one species, I can
hardly doubt that it serves for the same purpose in the other species;
and I conclude from the threatening gestures made at the same time by
many snakes, that their hissing,--the rattling of the rattle-snake and
of the tail of the Trigonocephalus,--the grating of the scales of the
Echis,--and the dilatation of the hood of the Cobra,--all subserve the
same end, namely, to make them appear terrible to their enemies.[428]

It seems at first a probable conclusion that venomous snakes, such
as the foregoing, from being already so well defended by their
poison-fangs, would never be attacked by any enemy; and consequently
would have no need to excite additional terror. But this is far from
being the case, for they are largely preyed on in all quarters of the
world by many animals. It is well known that pigs are employed in the
United States to clear districts infested with rattle-snakes, which they
do most effectually.[429] In England the hedgehog attacks and devours
the viper. In India, as I hear from Dr. Jerdon, several kinds of hawks,
and at least one mammal, the Herpestes, kill cobras and other venomous
species;[430] and so it is in South Africa. Therefore it is by no means
improbable that any sounds or signs by which the venomous species could
instantly make themselves recognized as dangerous, would be of more
service to them than to the innocuous species which would not be able,
if attacked, to inflict any real injury.

Having said thus much about snakes, I am tempted to add a few remarks
on the means by which the rattle of the rattle-snake was probably
developed. Various animals, including some lizards, either curl or
vibrate their tails when excited. This is the case with many kinds
of snakes.[431] In the Zoological Gardens, an innocuous species, the
_Coronella Sayi_, vibrates its tail so rapidly that it becomes almost
invisible. The Trigonocephalus, before alluded to, has the same habit;
and the extremity of its tail is a little enlarged, or ends in a bead.
In the Lachesis, which is so closely allied to the rattle-snake that
it was placed by Linnaeus in the same genus, the tail ends in a single,
large, lancet-shaped point or scale. With some snakes the skin, as
Professor Shaler remarks, "is more imperfectly detached from the region
about the tail than at other parts of the body." Now if we suppose that
the end of the tail of some ancient American species was enlarged, and
was covered by a single large scale, this could hardly have been
cast off at the successive moults. In this case it would have been
permanently retained, and at each period of growth, as the snake grew
larger, a new scale, larger than the last, would have been formed
above it, and would likewise have been retained. The foundation for the
development of a rattle would thus have been laid; and it would have
been habitually used, if the species, like so many others, vibrated its
tail whenever it was irritated. That the rattle has since been specially
developed to serve as an efficient sound-producing instrument, there can
hardly be a doubt; for even the vertebrae included within the extremity
of the tail have been altered in shape and cohere. But there is no
greater improbability in various structures, such as the rattle of
the rattle-snake,--the lateral scales of the Echis,--the neck with
the included ribs of the Cobra,--and the whole body of the
puff-adder,--having been modified for the sake of warning and
frightening away their enemies, than in a bird, namely, the wonderful
Secretary-hawk (_Gypogeranus_) having had its whole frame modified for
the sake of killing snakes with impunity. It is highly probable, judging
from what we have before seen, that this bird would ruffle its feathers
whenever it attacked a snake; and it is certain that the Herpestes, when
it eagerly rushes to attack a snake, erects the hair all over its
body, and especially that on its tail.[432] We have also seen that some
porcupines, when angered or alarmed at the sight of a snake, rapidly
vibrate their tails, thus producing a peculiar sound by the striking
together of the hollow quills. So that here both the attackers and the
attacked endeavour to make themselves as dreadful as possible to each
other; and both possess for this purpose specialised means, which, oddly
enough, are nearly the same in some of these cases. Finally we can see
that if, on the one hand, those individual snakes, which were best able
to frighten away their enemies, escaped best from being devoured; and
if, on the other hand, those individuals of the attacking enemy survived
in larger numbers which were the best fitted for the dangerous task of
killing and devouring venomous snakes;--then in the one case as in the
other, beneficial variations, supposing the characters in question to
vary, would commonly have been preserved through the survival of the
fittest.

_The Drawing back and pressure of the Ears to the Head_.--The ears
through their movements are highly expressive in many animals; but in
some, such as man, the higher apes, and many ruminants, they fail in
this respect. A slight difference in position serves to express in the
plainest manner a different state of mind, as we may daily see in the
dog; but we are here concerned only with the ears being drawn closely
backwards and pressed to the head. A savage frame of mind is thus shown,
but only in the case of those animals which fight with their teeth; and
the care which they take to prevent their ears being seized by their
antagonists, accounts for this position. Consequently, through habit
and association, whenever they feel slightly savage, or pretend in their
play to be savage, their ears are drawn back. That this is the true
explanation may be inferred from the relation which exists in very many
animals between their manner of fighting and the retraction of their
ears.

All the Carnivora fight with their canine teeth, and all, as far as I
have observed, draw their ears back when feeling savage. This may be
continually seen with dogs when fighting in earnest, and with puppies
fighting in play. The movement is different from the falling down
and slight drawing back of the ears, when a dog feels pleased and is
caressed by his master. The retraction of the ears may likewise be seen
in kittens fighting together in their play, and in full-grown cats when
really savage, as before illustrated in fig. 9 (p. 58). Although their
ears are thus to a large extent protected, yet they often get much torn
in old male cats during their mutual battles. The same movement is very
striking in tigers, leopards, &c., whilst growling over their food in
menageries. The lynx has remarkably long ears; and their retraction,
when one of these animals is approached in its cage, is very
conspicuous, and is eminently expressive of its savage disposition. Even
one of the Eared Seals, the _Otariapusilla_, which has very small ears,
draws them backwards, when it makes a savage rush at the legs of its
keeper.

When horses fight together they use their incisors for biting, and
their fore-legs for striking, much more than they do their hind-legs
for kicking backwards. This has been observed when stallions have broken
loose and have fought together, and may likewise be inferred from the
kind of wounds which they inflict on each other. Every one recognizes
the vicious appearance which the drawing back of the ears gives to a
horse. This movement is very different from that of listening to a
sound behind. If an ill-tempered horse in a stall is inclined to kick
backwards, his ears are retracted from habit, though he has no intention
or power to bite. But when a horse throws up both hind-legs in play, as
when entering an open field, or when just touched by the whip, he does
not generally depress his ears, for he does not then feel vicious.
Guanacoes fight savagely with their teeth; and they must do so
frequently, for I found the hides of several which I shot in Patagonia
deeply scored. So do camels; and both these animals, when savage, draw
their ears closely backwards. Guanacoes, as I have noticed, when not
intending to bite, but merely to spit their offensive saliva from a
distance at an intruder, retract their ears. Even the hippopotamus, when
threatening with its widely-open enormous mouth a comrade, draws back
its small ears, just like a horse.

Now what a contrast is presented between the foregoing animals and
cattle, sheep, or goats, which never use their teeth in fighting, and
never draw back their ears when enraged! Although sheep and goats appear
such placid animals, the males often join in furious contests. As deer
form a closely related family, and as I did not know that they ever
fought with their teeth, I was much surprised at the account given by
Major Ross King of the Moose-deer in Canada. He says, when "two
males chance to meet, laying back their ears and gnashing their teeth
together, they rush at each other with appalling fury."[433] But Mr.
Bartlett informs me that some species of deer fight savagely with their
teeth, so that the drawing back of the ears by the moose accords with
our rule. Several kinds of kangaroos, kept in the Zoological Gardens,
fight by scratching with their fore-feet and by kicking with their
hind-legs; but they never bite each other, and the keepers have never
seen them draw back their ears when angered. Rabbits fight chiefly by
kicking and scratching, but they likewise bite each other; and I
have known one to bite off half the tail of its antagonist. At the
commencement of their battles they lay back their ears, but afterwards,
as they bound over and kick each other, they keep their ears erect, or
move them much about.

Mr. Bartlett watched a wild boar quarrelling rather savagely with his
sow; and both had their mouths open and their ears drawn backwards.
But this does not appear to be a common action with domestic pigs when
quarrelling. Boars fight together by striking upwards with their
tusks; and Mr. Bartlett doubts whether they then draw back their ears.
Elephants, which in like manner fight with their tusks, do not retract
their ears, but, on the contrary, erect them when rushing at each other
or at an enemy.

The rhinoceroses in the Zoological Gardens fight with their nasal horns,
and have never been seen to attempt biting each other except in play;
and the keepers are convinced that they do not draw back their ears,
like horses and dogs, when feeling savage. The following statement,
therefore, by Sir S. Baker[434] is inexplicable, namely, that a
rhinoceros, which he shot in North Africa, "had no ears; they had
been bitten off close to the head by another of the same species while
fighting; and this mutilation is by no means uncommon."

Lastly, with respect to monkeys. Some kinds, which have moveable ears,
and which fight with their teeth--for instance the _Cereopithecus
ruber_--draw back their ears when irritated just like dogs; and they
then have a very spiteful appearance. Other kinds, as the _Inuus
ecaudatus_, apparently do not thus act. Again, other kinds--and this
is a great anomaly in comparison with most other animals--retract their
ears, show their teeth, and jabber, when they are pleased by being
caressed. I observed this in two or three species of Macacus, and in
the _Cynopithecus niger_. This expression, owing to our familiarity
with dogs, would never be recognized as one of joy or pleasure by those
unacquainted with monkeys.

_Erection of the Ears_.--This movement requires hardly any notice. All
animals which have the power of freely moving their ears, when they are
startled, or when they closely observe any object, direct their ears
to the point towards which they are looking, in order to hear any sound
from this quarter. At the same time they generally raise their heads,
as all their organs of sense are there situated, and some of the smaller
animals rise on their hind-legs. Even those kinds which squat on the
ground or instantly flee away to avoid danger, generally act momentarily
in this manner, in order to ascertain the source and nature of the
danger. The head being raised, with erected ears and eyes directed
forwards, gives an unmistakable expression of close attention to any
animal.



CHAPTER V. -- SPECIAL EXPRESSIONS OF ANIMALS.

The Dog, various expressive movements
of--Cats--Horses--Ruminants--Monkeys, their expression of joy and
affection--Of pain--Anger--Astonishment and Terror.


_The Dog_.--I have already described (figs. 5 and 1) the appearance of
a dog approaching another dog with hostile intentions, namely, with
erected ears, eyes intently directed forwards, hair on the neck and back
bristling, gait remarkably stiff, with the tail upright and rigid. So
familiar is this appearance to us, that an angry man is sometimes said
"to have his back up." Of the above points, the stiff gait and upright
tail alone require further discussion. Sir C. Bell remarks[501] that,
when a tiger or wolf is struck by its keeper and is suddenly roused to
ferocity, every muscle is in tension, and the limbs are in an attitude
of strained exertion, prepared to spring. This tension of the muscles
and consequent stiff gait may be accounted for on the principle of
associated habit, for anger has continually led to fierce struggles,
and consequently to all the muscles of the body having been violently
exerted. There is also reason to suspect that the muscular system
requires some short preparation, or some degree of innervation, before
being brought into strong action. My own sensations lead me to this
inference; but I cannot discover that it is a conclusion admitted by
physiologists. Sir J. Paget, however, informs me that when muscles are
suddenly contracted with the greatest force, without any preparation,
they are liable to be ruptured, as when a man slips unexpectedly; but
that this rarely occurs when an action, however violent, is deliberately
performed.

With respect to the upright position of the tail, it seems to depend
(but whether this is really the case I know not) on the elevator muscles
being more powerful than the depressors, so that when all the muscles
of the hinder part of the body are in a state of tension, the tail is
raised. A dog in cheerful spirits, and trotting before his master with
high, elastic steps, generally carries his tail aloft, though it is not
held nearly so stiffly as when he is angered. A horse when first turned
out into an open field, may be seen to trot with long elastic strides,
the head and tail being held high aloft. Even cows when they frisk about
from pleasure, throw up their tails in a ridiculous fashion. So it is
with various animals in the Zoological Gardens. The position of the
tail, however, in certain cases, is determined by special circumstances;
thus as soon as a horse breaks into a gallop, at full speed, he always
lowers his tail, so that as little resistance as possible may be offered
to the air.

When a dog is on the point of springing on his antagonist, he utters a
savage growl; the ears are pressed closely backwards, and the upper lip
(fig. 14) is retracted out of the way of his teeth, especially of his
canines. These movements may be observed with dogs and puppies in
their play. But if a dog gets really savage in his play, his expression
immediately changes. This, however, is simply due to the lips and ears
being drawn back with much greater energy. If a dog only snarls at
another, the lip is generally retracted on one side alone, namely
towards his enemy.

[Illustration: Head of snarling Dog. Fig 14]

{illust. caption = FIG. 14.--Head of snarling Dog. From life, by Mr.
Wood.

The movements of a dog whilst exhibiting affection towards his master
were described (figs. 6 and 8) in our second chapter. These consist
in the head and whole body being lowered and thrown into flexuous
movements, with the tail extended and wagged from side to side. The ears
fall down and are drawn somewhat backwards, which causes the eyelids to
be elongated, and alters the whole appearance of the face. The lips hang
loosely, and the hair remains smooth. All these movements or gestures
are explicable, as I believe, from their standing in complete antithesis
to those naturally assumed by a savage dog under a directly opposite
state of mind. When a man merely speaks to, or just notices, his dog, we
see the last vestige of these movements in a slight wag of the tail,
without any other movement of the body, and without even the ears being
lowered. Dogs also exhibit their affection by desiring to rub against
their masters, and to be rubbed or patted by them. Gratiolet explains
the above gestures of affection in the following manner: and the reader
can judge whether the explanation appears satisfactory. Speaking of
animals in general, including the dog, he says,[502] "C'est toujours la
partie la plus sensible de leurs corps qui recherche les caresses ou les
donne. Lorsque toute la longueur des flancs et du corps est sensible,
l'animal serpente et rampe sous les caresses; et ces ondulations se
propageant le long des muscles analogues des segments jusqu'aux
extremites de la colonne vertebrale, la queue se ploie et s'agite."
Further on, he adds, that dogs, when feeling affectionate, lower their
ears in order to exclude all sounds, so that their whole attention may
be concentrated on the caresses of their master! Dogs have another and
striking way of exhibiting their affection, namely, by licking the hands
or faces of their masters. They sometimes lick other dogs, and then it
is always their chops. I have also seen dogs licking cats with whom they
were friends. This habit probably originated in the females carefully
licking their puppies--the dearest object of their love--for the sake of
cleansing them. They also often give their puppies, after a short
absence, a few cursory licks, apparently from affection. Thus the habit
will have become associated with the emotion of love, however it may
afterwards be aroused. It is now so firmly inherited or innate, That it
is transmitted equally to both sexes. A female terrier of mine lately
had her puppies destroyed, and though at all times a very affectionate
creature, I was much struck with the manner in which she then tried to
satisfy her instinctive maternal love by expending it on me; and her
desire to lick my hands rose to an insatiable passion.

The same principle probably explains why dogs, when feeling
affectionate, like rubbing against their masters and being rubbed or
patted by them, for from the nursing of their puppies, contact with
a beloved object has become firmly associated in their minds with the
emotion of love. The feeling of affection of a dog towards his master is
combined with a strong sense of submission, which is akin to fear. Hence
dogs not only lower their bodies and crouch a little as they approach
their masters, but sometimes throw themselves on the ground with
their bellies upwards. This is a movement as completely opposite as is
possible to any show of resistance. I formerly possessed a large dog
who was not at all afraid to fight with other dogs; but a wolf-like
shepherd-dog in the neighbourhood, though not ferocious and not so
powerful as my dog, had a strange influence over him. When they met on
the road, my dog used to run to meet him, with his tail partly tucked in
between his legs and hair not erected; and then he would throw himself
on the ground, belly upwards. By this action he seemed to say more
plainly than by words, "Behold, I am your slave." A pleasurable and
excited state of mind, associated with affection, is exhibited by some
dogs in a very peculiar manner, namely, by grinning. This was noticed
long ago by Somerville, who says, And with a courtly grin, the fawning
bound Salutes thee cow'ring, his wide op'ning nose Upward he curls, and
his large sloe-back eyes Melt in soft blandishments, and humble joy.'
_The Chase_, book i. Sir W. Scott's famous Scotch greyhound, Maida, had
this habit, and it is common with terriers. I have also seen it in a
Spitz and in a sheep-dog. Mr. Riviere, who has particularly attended
to this expression, informs me that it is rarely displayed in a perfect
manner, but is quite common in a lesser degree. The upper lip during the
act of grinning is retracted, as in snarling, so that the canines are
exposed, and the ears are drawn backwards; but the general appearance
of the animal clearly shows that anger is not felt. Sir C. Bell[503]
remarks "Dogs, in their expression of fondness, have a slight eversion
of the lips, and grin and sniff amidst their gambols, in a way that
resembles laughter." Some persons speak of the grin as a smile, but
if it had been really a smile, we should see a similar, though more
pronounced, movement of the lips and ears, when dogs utter their bark
of joy; but this is not the case, although a bark of joy often follows
a grin. On the other hand, dogs, when playing with their comrades
or masters, almost always pretend to bite each other; and they then
retract, though not energetically, their lips and ears. Hence I suspect
that there is a tendency in some dogs, whenever they feel lively
pleasure combined with affection, to act through habit and association
on the same muscles, as in playfully biting each other, or their
masters' hands. I have described, in the second chapter, the gait and
appearance of a dog when cheerful, and the marked antithesis presented
by the same animal when dejected and disappointed, with his head, ears,
body, tail, and chops drooping, and eyes dull. Under the expectation of
any great pleasure, dogs bound and jump about in an extravagant manner,
and bark for joy. The tendency to bark under this state of mind is
inherited, or runs in the breed: greyhounds rarely bark, whilst the
Spitz-dog barks so incessantly on starting for a walk with his master
that he becomes a nuisance.

An agony of pain is expressed by dogs in nearly the same way as by many
other animals, namely, by howling writhing, and contortions of the
whole body. Attention is shown by the head being raised, with the ears
erected, and eyes intently directed towards the object or quarter under
observation. If it be a sound and the source is not known, the head is
often turned obliquely from side to side in a most significant manner,
apparently in order to judge with more exactness from what point the
sound proceeds. But I have seen a dog greatly surprised at a new noise,
turning, his head to one side through habit, though he clearly perceived
the source of the noise. Dogs, as formerly remarked, when their
attention is in any way aroused, whilst watching some object, or
attending to some sound, often lift up one paw (fig. 4) and keep it
doubled up, as if to make a slow and stealthy approach. A dog under
extreme terror will throw himself down, howl, and void his excretions;
but the hair, I believe, does not become erect unless some anger is
felt. I have seen a dog much terrified at a band of musicians who
were playing loudly outside the house, with every muscle of his body
trembling, with his heart palpitating so quickly that the beats could
hardly be counted, and panting for breath with widely open mouth, in
the same manner as a terrified man does. Yet this dog had not exerted
himself; he had only wandered slowly and restlessly about the room, and
the day was cold. Even a very slight degree of fear is invariably shown
by the tail being tucked in between the legs. This tucking in of the
fail is accompanied by the ears being drawn backwards; but they are not
pressed closely to the head,nas in snarling, and they are not lowered,
as when a dog is pleased or affectionate. When two young dogs chase
each other in play, the one that runs away always keeps his tail tucked
inwards. So it is when a dog, in the highest spirits, careers like a mad
creature round and round his master in circles, or in figures of eight.
He then acts as if another dog were chasing him. This curious kind of
play, which must be familiar to every one who has attended to dogs,
is particularly apt to be excited, after the animal has been a little
startled or frightened, as by his master suddenly jumping out on him in
the dusk. In this case, as well as when two young dogs are chasing each
other in play, it appears as if the one that runs away was afraid of the
other catching him by the tail; but as far as I can find out, dogs very
rarely catch each other in this manner. I asked a gentleman, who
had kept foxhounds all his life, and be applied to other experienced
sportsmen, whether they had ever seen hounds thus seize a fox; but they
never had. It appears that when a dog is chased, or when in danger of
being struck behind, or of anything falling on him, in all these cases
he wishes to withdraw as quickly as possible his whole hind-quarters,
and that from some sympathy or connection between the muscles, the tail
is then drawn closely inwards. A similarly connected movement between
the hind-quarters and the tail may be observed in the hyaena. Mr.
Bartlett informs me that when two of these animals fight together, they
are mutually conscious of the wonderful power of each other's jaws, and
are extremely cautious. They well know that if one of their legs were
seized, the bone would instantly be crushed into atoms; hence they
approach each other kneeling, with their legs turned as much as possible
inwards, and with their whole bodies bowed, so as not to present any
salient point; the tail at the same time being closely tucked in between
the legs. In this attitude they approach each other sideways, or even
partly backwards. So again with deer, several of the species, when
savage and fighting, tuck in their tails. When one horse in a field
tries to bite the hind-quarters of another in play, or when a rough boy
strikes a donkey from behind, the hind-quarters and the tail are drawn
in, though it does not appear as if this were done merely to save
the tail from being injured. We have also seen the reverse of these
movements; for when an animal trots with high elastic steps, the tail
is almost always carried aloft. As I have said, when a dog is chased and
runs away, he keeps his ears directed backwards but still open; and this
is clearly done for the sake of hearing the footsteps of his pursuer.
From habit the ears are often held in this same position, and the tail
tucked in, when the danger is obviously in front. I have repeatedly
noticed, with a timid terrier of mine, that when she is afraid of some
object in front, the nature of which she perfectly knows and does not
need to reconnoitre, yet she will for a long time hold her ears and tail
in this position, looking the image of discomfort. Discomfort, without
any fear, is similarly expressed: thus, one day I went out of doors,
just at the time when this same dog knew that her dinner would be
brought. I did not call her, but she wished much to accompany me, and at
the same time she wished much for her dinner; and there she stood, first
looking one way and then the other, with her tail tucked in and
ears drawn back, presenting an unmistakable appearance of perplexed
discomfort. Almost all the expressive movements now described, with the
exception of the grinning from joy, are innate or instinctive, for they
are common to all the individuals, young and old, of all the breeds.
Most of them are likewise common to the aboriginal parents of the dog,
namely the wolf and jackal; and some of them to other species of the
same group. Tamed wolves and jackals, when caressed by their masters,
jump about for joy, wag their tails, lower their ears, lick their
master's hands, crouch down, and even throw themselves on the ground
belly upwards.[504] I have seen a rather fox-like African jackal, from
the Gaboon, depress its ears when caressed. Wolves and jackals, when
frightened, certainly tuck in their tails; and a tamed jackal has been
described as careering round his master in circles and figures of eight,
like a dog, with his tail between his legs. It has been stated[505]
that foxes, however tame, never display any of the above expressive
movements; but this is not strictly accurate. Many years ago I observed
in the Zoological Gardens, and recorded the fact at the time, that a
very tame English fox, When caressed by the keeper, wagged its tail,
depressed its ears, and then threw itself on the ground, belly upwards.
The black fox of North America likewise depressed its ears in a slight
degree. But I believe that foxes never lick the hands of their masters,
and I have been assured that when frightened they never tuck in their
tails. If the explanation which I have given of the expression of
affection in dogs be admitted, then it would appear that animals
which have never been domesticated--namely wolves, jackals, and even
foxes--have nevertheless acquired, through the principle of antithesis,
certain expressive gestures; for it is Dot probable that these animals,
confined in cages, should have learnt them by imitating dogs.

_Cats_.--I have already described the actions of a cat (fig. 9), when
feeling savage and not terrified. She assumes a crouching attitude and
occasionally protrudes her fore-feet, with the claws exserted ready
for striking. The tail is extended, being curled or lashed from side to
side. The hair is not erected--at least it was not so in the few cases
observed by me. The ears are drawn closely backwards and the teeth are
shown. Low savage growls are uttered. We can understand why the attitude
assumed by a cat when preparing to fight with another cat, or in any way
greatly irritated, is so widely different from that of a dog approaching
another dog with hostile intentions; for the cat uses her fore-feet for
striking, and this renders a crouching position convenient or necessary.
She is also much more accustomed than a dog to lie concealed and
suddenly spring on her prey. No cause can be assigned with certainty for
the tail being lashed or curled from side to side. This habit is common
to many other animals--for instance, to the puma, when prepared to
spring;[506] but it is not common to dogs, or to foxes, as I infer from
Mr. St. John's account of a fox lying in wait and seizing a hare. We
have already seen that some kinds of lizards and various snakes, when
excited, rapidly vibrate the tips of their tails. It would appear as
if, under strong excitement, there existed an uncontrollable desire for
movement of some kind, owing to nerve-force being freely liberated from
the excited sensorium; and that as the tail is left free, and as its
movement does not disturb the general position of the body, it is curled
or lashed about.

All the movements of a cat, when feeling affectionate, are in complete
antithesis to those just described. She now stands upright, with
slightly arched back, tail perpendicularly raised, and ears erected;
and she rubs her cheeks and flanks against her master or mistress. The
desire to rub something is so strong in cats under this state of mind,
that they may often be seen rubbing themselves against the legs of
chairs or tables, or against door-posts. This manner of expressing
affection probably originated through association, as in the case of
dogs, from the mother nursing and fondling her young; and perhaps from
the young themselves loving each other and playing together. Another
and very different gesture, expressive of pleasure, has already been
described, namely, the curious manner in which young and even old cats,
when pleased, alternately protrude their fore-feet, with separated toes,
as if pushing against and sucking their mother's teats. This habit is so
far analogous to that of rubbing against something, that both apparently
are derived from actions performed during the nursing period. Why cats
should show affection by rubbing so much more than do dogs, though
the latter delight in contact with their masters, and why cats only
occasionally lick the hands of their friends, whilst dogs always do so,
I cannot say. Cats cleanse themselves by licking their own coats more
regularly than do dogs. On the other hand, their tongues seem less well
fitted for the work than the longer and more flexible tongues of dogs.

[Illustration: Cat terrified at a dog.  Fig.15]

Cats, when terrified, stand at full height, and arch their backs in a
well-known and ridiculous fashion. They spit, hiss, or growl. The hair
over the whole body, and especially on the tail, becomes erect. In the
instances observed by me the basal part of the tail was held upright,
the terminal part being thrown on one side; but sometimes the tail (see
fig. 15) is only a little raised, and is bent almost from the base
to one side. The ears are drawn back, and the teeth exposed. When two
kittens are playing together, the one often thus tries to frighten the
other. From what we have seen in former chapters, all the above points
of expression are intelligible, except the extreme arching of the back.
I am inclined to believe that, in the same manner as many birds, whilst
they ruffle their feathers, spread out their wings and tail, to make
themselves look as big as possible, so cats stand upright at their full
height, arch their backs, often raise the basal part of the tail, and
erect their hair, for the same purpose. The lynx, when attacked, is said
to arch its back, and is thus figured by Brehm. But the keepers in the
Zoological Gardens have never seen any tendency to this action in the
larger feline animals, such as tigers, lions, &c.; and these have little
cause to be afraid of any other animal.

Cats use their voices much as a means of expression, and they utter,
under various emotions and desires, at least six or seven different
sounds. The purr of satisfaction, which is made during both inspiration
and expiration, is one of the most curious. The puma, cheetah, and
ocelot likewise purr; but the tiger, when pleased, "emits a peculiar
short snuffle, accompanied by the closure of the eyelids."[507] It is
said that the lion, jaguar, and leopard, do not purr.


_Horses_.--Horses when savage draw their ears closely back, protrude
their heads, and partially uncover their incisor teeth, ready for
biting. When inclined to kick behind, they generally, through habit,
draw back their ears; and their eyes are turned backwards in a peculiar
manner.[508] When pleased, as when some coveted food is brought to them
in the stable, they raise and draw in their heads, prick their ears,
and looking intently towards their friend, often whinny. Impatience is
expressed by pawing the ground.

The actions of a horse when much startled are highly expressive. One
day my horse was much frightened at a drilling machine, covered by a
tarpaulin, and lying on an open field. He raised his head so high, that
his neck became almost perpendicular; and this he did from habit, for
the machine lay on a slope below, and could not have been seen with
more distinctness through the raising of the head; nor if any sound had
proceeded from it, could the sound have been more distinctly heard. His
eyes and ears were directed intently forwards; and I could feel through
the saddle the palpitations of his heart. With red dilated nostrils he
snorted violently, and whirling round, would have dashed off at full
speed, had I not prevented him. The distension of the nostrils is not
for the sake of scenting the source of danger, for when a horse smells
carefully at any object and is not alarmed, he does not dilate his
nostrils. Owing to the presence of a valve in the throat, a horse
when panting does not breathe through his open mouth, but through his
nostrils; and these consequently have become endowed with great powers
of expansion. This expansion of the nostrils, as well as the snorting,
and the palpitations of the heart, are actions which have become firmly
associated during a long series of generations with the emotion of
terror; for terror has habitually led the horse to the most violent
exertion in dashing away at full speed from the cause of danger.


_Ruminants_.--Cattle and sheep are remarkable from displaying in so
slight a degree their emotions or sensations, excepting that of extreme
pain. A bull when enraged exhibits his rage only by the manner in which
he holds his lowered head, with distended nostrils, and by bellowing. He
also often paws the ground; but this pawing seems quite different from
that of an impatient horse, for when the soil is loose, he throws up
clouds of dust. I believe that bulls act in this manner when irritated
by flies, for the sake of driving them away. The wilder breeds of sheep
and the chamois when startled stamp on the ground, and whistle through
their noses; and this serves as a danger-signal to their comrades. The
musk-ox of the Arctic regions, when encountered, likewise stamps on the
ground.[509] How this stamping action arose I cannot conjecture; for
from inquiries which I have made it does not appear that any of these
animals fight with their fore-legs.

Some species of deer, when savage, display far more expression than do
cattle, sheep, or goats, for, as has already been stated, they draw back
their ears, grind their teeth, erect their hair, squeal, stamp on the
ground, and brandish their horns. One day in the Zoological Gardens, the
Formosan deer (_Cervus pseudaxis_) approached me in a curious attitude,
with his muzzle raised high up, so that the horns were pressed back on
his neck; the head being held rather obliquely. From the expression of
his eye I felt sure that he was savage; he approached slowly, and as
soon as he came close to the iron bars, he did not lower his head to
butt at me, but suddenly bent it inwards, and struck his horns with
great force against the railings. Mr. Bartlett informs me that some
other species of deer place themselves in the same attitude when
enraged.

_Monkeys_.--The various species and genera of monkeys express their
feelings in many different ways; and this fact is interesting, as in
some degree bearing on the question, whether the so-called races of man
should be ranked as distinct species or varieties; for, as we shall
see in the following chapters, the different races of man express their
emotions and sensations with remarkable uniformity throughout the world.
Some of the expressive actions of monkeys are interesting in another
way, namely from being closely analogous to those of man. As I have
had no opportunity of observing any one species of the group under all
circumstances, my miscellaneous remarks will be best arranged under
different states of the mind.

_Pleasure, joy, affection_--It is not possible to distinguish in
monkeys, at least without more experience than I have had, the
expression of pleasure or joy from that of affection. Young chimpanzees
make a kind of barking noise, when pleased by the return of any one to
whom they are attached. When this noise, which the keepers call a laugh,
is uttered, the lips are protruded; but so they are under various other
emotions. Nevertheless I could perceive that when they were pleased
the form of the lips differed a little from that assumed when they
were angered. If a young chimpanzee be tickled--and the armpits are
particularly sensitive to tickling, as in the case of our children,--a
more decided chuckling or laughing sound is uttered; though the
laughter is sometimes noiseless. The corners of the mouth are then drawn
backwards; and this sometimes causes the lower eyelids to be slightly
wrinkled. But this wrinkling, which is so characteristic of our own
laughter, is more plainly seen in some other monkeys. The teeth in
the upper jaw in the chimpanzee are not exposed when they utter their
laughing noise, in which respect they differ from us. But their
eyes sparkle and grow brighter, as Mr. W. L. Martin,[510] who has
particularly attended to their expression, states.

Young Orangs, when tickled, likewise grin and make a chuckling sound;
and Mr. Martin says that their eyes grow brighter. As soon as their
laughter ceases, an expression may be detected passing over their faces,
which, as Mr. Wallace remarked to me, may be called a smile. I have
also noticed something of the same kind with the chimpanzee. Dr.
Duchenne--and I cannot quote a better authority--informs me that he kept
a very tame monkey in his house for a year; and when he gave it during
meal-times some choice delicacy, he observed that the corners of
its mouth were slightly raised; thus an expression of satisfaction,
partaking of the nature of an incipient smile, and resembling that often
seen on the face of main, could be plainly perceived in this animal.

The _Cebus azarae_,[511] when rejoiced at again seeing a beloved person,
utters a peculiar tittering (_kichernden_) sound. It also expresses
agreeable sensations, by drawing back the corners of its mouth, without
producing any sound. Rengger calls this movement laughter, but it would
be more appropriately called a smile. The form of the mouth is different
when either pain or terror is expressed, and high shrieks are uttered.
Another species of _Cebus_ in the Zoological Gardens (_C. hypoleucus_)
when pleased, makes a reiterated shrill note, and likewise draws back
the corners of its mouth, apparently through the contraction of the same
muscles as with us. So does the Barbary ape (_Inuus ecaudatus_) to an
extraordinary degree; and I observed in this monkey that the skin of
the lower eyelids then became much wrinkled. At the same time it rapidly
moved its lower jaw or lips in a spasmodic manner, the teeth being
exposed; but the noise produced was hardly more distinct than that which
we sometimes call silent laughter. Two of the keepers affirmed that this
slight sound was the animal's laughter, and when I expressed some doubt
on this head (being at the time quite inexperienced), they made it
attack or rather threaten a hated Entellus monkey, living in the same
compartment. Instantly the whole expression of the face of the Inuus
changed; the mouth was opened much more widely, the canine teeth were
more fully exposed, and a hoarse barking noise was uttered.

The Anubis baboon (_Cynocephalus anubis_) was first insulted and put
into a furious rage, as was easily done, by his keeper, who then made
friends with him and shook hands. As the reconciliation was effected the
baboon rapidly moved up and down his jaws and lips, and looked pleased.
When we laugh heartily, a similar movement, or quiver, may be observed
more or less distinctly in our jaws; but with man the muscles of the
chest are more particularly acted on, whilst with this baboon, and with
some other monkeys, it is the muscles of the jaws and lips which are
spasmodically affected.

[Illustration: Cynopithecus niger, in a placid condition. Fig.16]

[Illustration: Cynopithecus niger, pleased by being caressed. Fig.17]

I have already had occasion to remark on the curious manner in which
two or three species of Alacacus and the _Cynopithecus niger_ draw back
their ears and utter a slight jabbering noise, when they are pleased
by being caressed. With the Cynopithecus (fig. 17), the corners of the
mouth are at the same time drawn backwards and upwards, so that the
teeth are exposed. Hence this expression would never be recognized by a
stranger as one of pleasure. The crest of long hairs on the forehead is
depressed, and apparently the whole skin of the head drawn backwards.
The eyebrows are thus raised a little, and the eyes assume a staring
appearance. The lower eyelids also become slightly wrinkled; but this
wrinkling is not conspicuous, owing to the permanent transverse furrows
on the face.

_Painful emotions and sensations_.--With monkeys the expression of
slight pain, or of any painful emotion, such as grief, vexation,
jealousy, &c., is not easily distinguished from that of moderate anger;
and these states of mind readily and quickly pass into each other.
Grief, however, with some species is certainly exhibited by weeping.
A woman, who sold a monkey to the Zoological Society, believed to have
come from Borneo (_Macacus maurus_ or _M. inornatus_ of Gray), said that
it often cried; and Mr. Bartlett, as well as the keeper Mr. Sutton, have
repeatedly seen it, when grieved, or even when much pitied, weeping
so copiously that the tears rolled down its cheeks. There is, however,
something strange about this case, for two specimens subsequently kept
in the Gardens, and believed to be the same species, have never been
seen to weep, though they were carefully observed by the keeper and
myself when much distressed and loudly screaming. Rengger states[512]
that the eyes of the _Cebus azarae_ fill with tears, but not
sufficiently to overflow, when it is prevented getting some much desired
object, or is much frightened. Humboldt also asserts that the eyes of
the _Callithrix sciureus_ "instantly fill with tears when it is seized
with fear;" but when this pretty little monkey in the Zoological Gardens
was teased, so as to cry out loudly, this did not occur. I do not,
however, wish to throw the least doubt on the accuracy of Humboldt's
statement.

The appearance of dejection in young orangs and chimpanzees, when out
of health, is as plain and almost as pathetic as in the case of our
children. This state of mind and body is shown by their listless
movements, fallen countenances, dull eyes, and changed complexion.

_Anger_.--This emotion is often exhibited by many kinds of monkeys, and
is expressed, as Mr. Martin remarks,[513] in many different ways. "Some
species, when irritated, pout the lips, gaze with a fixed and savage
glare on their foe, and make repeated short starts as if about to spring
forward, uttering at the same time inward guttural sounds. Many display
their anger by suddenly advancing, making abrupt starts, at the same
time opening the mouth and pursing up the lips, so as to conceal the
teeth, while the eyes are daringly fixed on the enemy, as if in savage
defiance. Some again, and principally the long-tailed monkeys, or
Guenons, display their teeth, and accompany their malicious grins with
a sharp, abrupt, reiterated cry." Mr. Sutton confirms the statement that
some species uncover their teeth when enraged, whilst others conceal
them by the protrusion of their lips; and some kinds draw back their
ears. The _Cynopithecus niger_, lately referred to, acts in this manner,
at the same time depressing the crest of hair on its forehead, and
showing its teeth; so that the movements of the features from anger are
nearly the same as those from pleasure; and the two expressions can be
distinguished only by those familiar with the animal.

Baboons often show their passion and threaten their enemies in a very
odd manner, namely, by opening their mouths widely as in the act of
yawning. Mr. Bartlett has often seen two baboons, when first placed
in the same compartment, sitting opposite to each other and thus
alternately opening their mouths; and this action seems frequently to
end in a real yawn. Mr. Bartlett believes that both animals wish to show
to each other that they are provided with a formidable set of teeth, as
is undoubtedly the case. As I could hardly credit the reality of this
yawning gesture, Mr. Bartlett insulted an old baboon and put him into a
violent passion; and he almost immediately thus acted. Some species of
Macacus and of Cereopithecus[514] behave in the same manner. Baboons
likewise show their anger, as was observed by Brehin with those which
he kept alive in Abyssinia, in another manner, namely, by striking the
ground with one hand, "like an angry man striking the table with his
fist." I have seen this movement with the baboons in the Zoological
Gardens; but sometimes the action seems rather to represent the
searching for a stone or other object in their beds of straw.

Mr. Sutton has often observed the face of the _Macacus rhesus_, when
much enraged, growing red. As he was mentioning this to me, another
monkey attacked a _rhesus_, and I saw its face redden as plainly as that
of a man in a violent passion. In the course of a few minutes, after the
battle, the face of this monkey recovered its natural tint. At the same
time that the face reddened, the naked posterior part of the body, which
is always red, seemed to grow still redder; but I cannot positively
assert that this was the case. When the Mandrill is in any way excited,
the brilliantly coloured, naked parts of the skin are said to become
still more vividly coloured.

With several species of baboons the ridge of the forehead projects much
over the eyes, and is studded with a few long hairs, representing our
eyebrows. These animals are always looking about them, and in order
to look upwards they raise their eyebrows. They have thus, as it would
appear, acquired the habit of frequently moving their eyebrows. However
this may be, many kinds of monkeys, especially the baboons, when angered
or in any way excited, rapidly and incessantly move their eyebrows
up and down, as well as the hairy skin of their foreheads.[515] As we
associate in the case of man the raising and lowering of the eyebrows
with definite states of the mind, the almost incessant movement of the
eyebrows by monkeys gives them a senseless expression. I once observed
a man who had a trick of continually raising his eyebrows without any
corresponding emotion, and this gave to him a foolish appearance; so it
is with some persons who keep the corners of their mouths a little drawn
backwards and upwards, as if by an incipient smile, though at the time
they are not amused or pleased.

A young orang, made jealous by her keeper attending to another monkey,
slightly uncovered her teeth, and, uttering a peevish noise like
_tish-shist_, turned her back on him. Both orangs and chimpanzees, when
a little more angered, protrude their lips greatly, and make a harsh
barking noise. A young female chimpanzee, in a violent passion,
presented a curious resemblance to a child in the same state. She
screamed loudly with widely open mouth, the lips being retracted so that
the teeth were fully exposed. She threw her arms wildly about, sometimes
clasping them over her head. She rolled on the ground, sometimes on her
back, sometimes on her belly, and bit everything within reach. A young
gibbon (_Hylobates syndactylus_) in a passion has been described[516] as
behaving in almost exactly the same manner.

The lips of young orangs and chimpanzees are protruded, sometimes to a
wonderful degree, under various circumstances. They act thus, not only
when slightly angered, sulky, or disappointed, but when alarmed at
anything--in one instance, at the sight of a turtle,[517]--and likewise
when pleased. But neither the degree of protrusion nor the shape of the
mouth is exactly the same, as I believe, in all cases; and the
sounds which are then uttered are different. The accompanying drawing
represents a chimpanzee made sulky by an orange having been offered him,
and then taken away. A similar protrusion or pouting of the lips, though
to a much slighter degree, may be seen in sulky children.

[Illustration: Chimpanzee disappointed and sulky. Fig. 18]

Many years ago, in the Zoological Gardens, I placed a looking-glass
on the floor before two young orangs, who, as far as it was known, had
never before seen one. At first they gazed at their own images with the
most steady surprise, and often changed their point of view. They then
approached close and protruded their lips towards the image, as if to
kiss it, in exactly the same manner as they had previously done towards
each other, when first placed, a few days before, in the same room. They
next made all sorts of grimaces, and put themselves in various attitudes
before the mirror; they pressed and rubbed the surface; they placed
their hands at different distances behind it; looked behind it; and
finally seemed almost frightened, started a little, became cross, and
refused to look any longer.

When we try to perform some little action which is difficult and
requires precision, for instance, to thread a needle, we generally
close our lips firmly, for the sake, I presume, of not disturbing our
movements by breathing; and I noticed the same action in a young Orang.
The poor little creature was sick, and was amusing itself by trying to
kill the flies on the window-panes with its knuckles; this was difficult
as the flies buzzed about, and at each attempt the lips were firmly
compressed, and at the same time slightly protruded.

Although the countenances, and more especially the gestures, of orangs
and chimpanzees are in some respects highly expressive, I doubt whether
on the whole they are so expressive as those of some other kinds of
monkeys. This may be attributed in part to their ears being immovable,
and in part to the nakedness of their eyebrows, of which the movements
are thus rendered less conspicuous. When, however, they raise their
eyebrows their foreheads become, as with us, transversely wrinkled.
In comparison with man, their faces are inexpressive, chiefly owing to
their not frowning under any emotion of the mind--that is, as far as
I have been able to observe, and I carefully attended to this point.
Frowning, which is one of the most important of all the expressions in
man, is due to the contraction of the corrugators by which the eyebrows
are lowered and brought together, so that vertical furrows are formed
on the forehead. Both the orang and chimpanzee are said[518] to possess
this muscle, but it seems rarely brought into action, at least in a
conspicuous manner. I made my hands into a sort of cage, and placing
some tempting fruit within, allowed both a young orang and chimpanzee
to try their utmost to get it out; but although they grew rather cross,
they showed not a trace of a frown. Nor was there any frown when they
were enraged. Twice I took two chimpanzees from their rather dark room
suddenly into bright sunshine, which would certainly have caused us to
frown; they blinked and winked their eyes, but only once did I see
a very slight frown. On another occasion, I tickled the nose of a
chimpanzee with a straw, and as it crumpled up its face, slight vertical
furrows appeared between the eyebrows. I have never seen a frown on the
forehead of the orang.

The gorilla, when enraged, is described as erecting its crest of
hair, throwing down its under lip, dilating its nostrils, and uttering
terrific yells. Messrs. Savage and Wyman[519] state that the scalp can
be freely moved backwards and forwards, and that when the animal is
excited it is strongly contracted; but I presume that they mean by this
latter expression that the scalp is lowered; for they likewise speak of
the young chimpanzee, when crying out, as having the eyebrows strongly
contracted. The great power of movement in the scalp of the gorilla, of
many baboons and other monkeys, deserves notice in relation to the power
possessed by some few men, either through reversion or persistence, of
voluntarily moving their scalps.[520]

_Astonishment, Terror_--A living fresh-water turtle was placed at my
request in the same compartment in the Zoological Gardens with many
monkeys; and they showed unbounded astonishment, as well as some fear.
This was displayed by their remaining motionless, staring intently with
widely opened eyes, their eyebrows being often moved up and down. Their
faces seemed somewhat lengthened. They occasionally raised themselves
on their hind-legs to get abetter view. They often retreated a few feet,
and then turning their heads over one shoulder, again stared intently.
It was curious to observe how much less afraid they were of the
turtle than of a living snake which I had formerly placed in their
compartment;[521] for in the course of a few minutes some of the monkeys
ventured to approach and touch the turtle. On the other hand, some of
the larger baboons were greatly terrified, and grinned as if on the
point of screaming out. When I showed a little dressed-up doll to the
_Cynopithecus niger_, it stood motionless, stared intently with widely
opened eyes, and advanced its ears a little forwards. But when the
turtle was placed in its compartment, this monkey also moved its lips in
an odd, rapid, jabbering manner, which the keeper declared was meant to
conciliate or please the turtle.

I was never able clearly to perceive that the eyebrows of astonished
monkeys were kept permanently raised, though they were frequently moved
up and down. Attention, which precedes astonishment, is expressed by man
by a slight raising of the eyebrows; and Dr. Duchenne informs me that
when he gave to the monkey formerly mentioned some quite new article of
food, it elevated its eyebrows a little, thus assuming an appearance of
close attention. It then took the food in its fingers, and, with
lowered or rectilinear eyebrows, scratched, smelt, and examined it,--an
expression of reflection being thus exhibited. Sometimes it would
throw back its head a little, and again with suddenly raised eyebrows
re-examine and finally taste the food.

In no case did any monkey keep its mouth open when it was astonished.
Mr. Sutton observed for me a young orang and chimpanzee during a
considerable length of time; and however much they were astonished, or
whilst listening intently to some strange sound, they did not keep
their mouths open. This fact is surprising, as with mankind hardly any
expression is more general than a widely open mouth under the sense of
astonishment. As far as I have been able to observe, monkeys breathe
more freely through their nostrils than men do; and this may account
for their not opening their mouths when they are astonished; for, as we
shall see in a future chapter, man apparently acts in this manner when
startled, at first for the sake of quickly drawing a full inspiration,
and afterwards for the sake of breathing as quietly as possible.

Terror is expressed by many kinds of monkeys by the utterance of shrill
screams; the lips being drawn back, so that the teeth are exposed. The
hair becomes erect, especially when some anger is likewise felt. Mr.
Sutton has distinctly seen the face of the _Macacus rhesus_ grow pale
from fear. Monkeys also tremble from fear; and sometimes they void their
excretions. I have seen one which, when caught, almost fainted from an
excess of terror.

Sufficient facts have now been given with respect to the expressions
of various animals. It is impossible to agree with Sir C. Bell when he
says[522] that "the faces of animals seem chiefly capable of expressing
rage and fear;" and again, when he says that all their expressions
"may be referred, more or less plainly, to their acts of volition or
necessary instincts." He who will look at a dog preparing to attack
another dog or a man, and at the same animal when caressing his master,
or will watch the countenance of a monkey when insulted, and when
fondled by his keeper, will be forced to admit that the movements of
their features and their gestures are almost as expressive as those of
man. Although no explanation can be given of some of the expressions in
the lower animals, the greater number are explicable in accordance with
the three principles given at the commencement of the first chapter.



CHAPTER VI. -- SPECIAL EXPRESSIONS OF MAN: SUFFERING AND WEEPING.

The screaming and weeping Of infants--Forms of features--Age at
which weeping commences--The effects of habitual restraint on
weeping--Sobbing--Cause of the contraction of the muscles round the eyes
during screaming--Cause of the secretion of tears.


IN this and the following chapters the expressions exhibited by Man
under various states of the mind will be described and explained, as far
as lies in my power. My observations will be arranged according to the
order which I have found the most convenient; and this will generally
lead to opposite emotions and sensations succeeding each other.

_Suffering of the body and mind: weeping_.--I have already described in
sufficient detail, in the third chapter, the signs of extreme pain, as
shown by screams or groans, with the writhing of the whole body and the
teeth clenched or ground together. These signs are often accompanied or
followed by profuse sweating, pallor, trembling, utter prostration,
or faintness. No suffering is greater than that from extreme fear
or horror, but here a distinct emotion comes into play, and will be
elsewhere considered. Prolonged suffering, especially of the mind,
passes into low spirits, grief, dejection, and despair, and these
states will be the subject of the following chapter. Here I shall almost
confine myself to weeping or crying, more especially in children.

Infants, when suffering even slight pain, moderate hunger, or
discomfort, utter violent and prolonged screams. Whilst thus screaming
their eyes are firmly closed, so that the skin round them is wrinkled,
and the forehead contracted into a frown. The mouth is widely opened
with the lips retracted in a peculiar manner, which causes it to assume
a squarish form; the gums or teeth being more or less exposed. The
breath is inhaled almost spasmodically. It is easy to observe infants
whilst screaming; but I have found photographs made by the instantaneous
process the best means for observation, as allowing more deliberation. I
have collected twelve, most of them made purposely for me; and they all
exhibit the same general characteristics. I have, therefore, had six of
them[601] (Plate I.) reproduced by the heliotype process.

[Illustration: Screaming Infants. Plate I. ]

The firm closing of the eyelids and consequent compression of
the eyeball,--and this is a most important element in various
expressions,--serves to protect the eyes from becoming too much gorged
with blood, as will presently be explained in detail. With respect to
the order in which the several muscles contract in firmly compressing
the eyes, I am indebted to Dr. Langstaff, of Southampton, for some
observations, which I have since repeated. The best plan for observing
the order is to make a person first raise his eyebrows, and this
produces transverse wrinkles across the forehead; and then very
gradually to contract all the muscles round the elves with as much force
as possible. The reader who is unacquainted with the anatomy of the
face, ought to refer to p. 24, and look at the woodcuts 1 to 3. The
corrugators of the brow (_corrugator supercilii_) seem to be the first
muscles to contract; and these draw the eyebrows downwards and inwards
towards the base of the nose, causing vertical furrows, that is a
frown, to appear between the eyebrows; at the same time they cause
the disappearance of the transverse wrinkles across the forehead. The
orbicular muscles contract almost simultaneously with the corrugators,
and produce wrinkles all round the eyes; they appear, however, to be
enabled to contract with greater force, as soon as the contraction
of the corrugators has given them some support. Lastly, the pyramidal
muscles of the nose contract; and these draw the eyebrows and the skin
of the forehead still lower down, producing short transverse wrinkles
across the base of the nose.[602] For the sake of brevity these muscles
will generally be spoken of as the orbiculars, or as those surrounding
the eyes.

When these muscles are strongly contracted, those running to the upper
lip[603] likewise contract and raise the upper lip. This might have been
expected from the manner in which at least one of them, the _malaris_,
is connected with the orbiculars. Any one who will gradually contract
the muscles round his eyes, will feel, as he increases the force, that
his upper lip and the wings of his nose (which are partly acted on by
one of the same muscles) are almost always a little drawn up. If he
keeps his mouth firmly shut whilst contracting the muscles round the
eyes, and then suddenly relaxes his lips, he will feel that the pressure
on his eyes immediately increases. So again when a person on a bright,
glaring day wishes to look at a distant object, but is compelled
partially to close his eyelids, the upper lip may almost always be
observed to be somewhat raised. The mouths of some very short-sighted
persons, who are forced habitually to reduce the aperture of their eyes,
wear from this same reason a grinning expression.

The raising of the upper lip draws upwards the flesh of the upper parts
of the cheeks, and produces a strongly marked fold on each cheek,--the
naso-labial fold,--which runs from near the wings of the nostrils to the
corners of the mouth and below them. This fold or furrow may be seen in
all the photographs, and is very characteristic of the expression of
a crying child; though a nearly similar fold is produced in the act of
laughing or Smiling.[604]

As the upper lip is much drawn up during the act of screaming, in the
manner just explained, the depressor muscles of the angles of the mouth
(see K in woodcuts 1 and 2) are strongly contracted in order to keep the
mouth widely open, so that a full volume of sound may be poured forth.
The action of these opposed muscles, above and below, tends to give
to the mouth an oblong, almost squarish outline, as may be seen in the
accompanying photographs. An excellent observer,[605] in describing a
baby crying whilst being fed, says, "it made its mouth like a square,
and let the porridge run out at all four corners." I believe, but we
shall return to this point in a future chapter, that the depressor
muscles of the angles of the mouth are less under the separate control
of the will than the adjoining muscles; so that if a young child is
only doubtfully inclined to cry, this muscle is generally the first
to contract, and is the last to cease contracting. When older children
commence crying, the muscles which run to the upper lip are often the
first to contract; and this may perhaps be due to older children not
having so strong a tendency to scream loudly, and consequently to keep
their mouths widely open; so that the above-named depressor muscles are
not brought into such strong action.

With one of my own infants, from his eighth day and for some time
afterwards, I often observed that the first sign of a screaming-fit,
when it could be observed coming on gradually, was a little frown, owing
to the contraction of the corrugators of the brows; the capillaries of
the naked head and face becoming at the same time reddened with blood.
As soon as the screaming-fit actually began, all the muscles round
the eyes were strongly contracted, and the mouth widely opened in the
manlier above described; so that at this early period the features
assumed the same form as at a more advanced age.

Dr. Piderit[606] lays great stress on the contraction of certain
muscles which draw down the nose and narrow the nostrils, as eminently
characteristic of a crying expression. The _depressores anguli oris_,
as we have just seen, are usually contracted at the same time, and they
indirectly tend, according to Dr. Duchenne, to act in this same manner
on the nose. With children having bad colds a similar pinched appearance
of the nose may be noticed, which is at least partly due, as remarked
to me by Dr. Langstaff, to their constant snuffling, and the consequent
pressure of the atmosphere on the two sides. The purpose of this
contraction of the nostrils by children having bad colds, or whilst
crying, seems to be to cheek the downward flow of the mucus and tears,
and to prevent these fluids spreading over the upper lip.

After a prolonged and severe screaming-fit, the scalp, face, and eyes
are reddened, owing to the return of the blood from the head having
been impeded by the violent expiratory efforts; but the redness of the
stimulated eyes is chiefly due to the copious effusion of tears. The
various muscles of the face which have been strongly contracted,
still twitch a little, and the upper lip is still slightly drawn up
or everted,[607] with the corners of the mouth still a little drawn
downwards. I have myself felt, and have observed in other grown-up
persons, that when tears are restrained with difficulty, as in reading a
pathetic story, it is almost impossible to prevent the various muscles.
which with young children are brought into strong action during their
screaming-fits, from slightly twitching or trembling.

Infants whilst young do not shed tears or weep, as is well known to
nurses and medical men. This circumstance is not exclusively due to
the lacrymal glands being as yet incapable of secreting tears. I first
noticed this fact from having accidentally brushed with the cuff of my
coat the open eye of one of my infants, when seventy-seven days
old, causing this eye to water freely; and though the child screamed
violently, the other eye remained dry, or was only slightly suffused
with tears. A similar slight effusion occurred ten days previously in
both eyes during a screaming-fit. The tears did not run over the eyelids
and roll down the cheeks of this child, whilst screaming badly, when 122
days old. This first happened 17 days later, at the age of 139 days.
A few other children have been observed for me, and the period of
free weeping appears to be very variable. In one case, the eyes became
slightly suffused at the age of only 20 days; in another, at 62 days.
With two other children, the tears did NOT run down the face at the ages
of 84 and 110 days; but in a third child they did run down at the age of
104 days. In one instance, as I was positively assured, tears ran
down at the unusually early age of 42 days. It would appear as if the
lacrymal glands required some practice in the individual before they
are easily excited into action, in somewhat the same manner as various
inherited consensual movements and tastes require some exercise before
they are fixed and perfected. This is all the more likely with a habit
like weeping, which must have been acquired since the period when man
branched off from the common progenitor of the genus Homo and of the
non-weeping anthropomorphous apes.

The fact of tears not being shed at a very early age from pain or any
mental emotion is remarkable, as, later in life, no expression is more
general or more strongly marked than weeping. When the habit has
once been acquired by an infant, it expresses in the clearest manner
suffering of all kinds, both bodily pain and mental distress, even
though accompanied by other emotions, such as fear or rage. The
character of the crying, however, changes at a very early age, as I
noticed in my own infants,--the passionate cry differing from that of
grief. A lady informs me that her child, nine months old, when in a
passion screams loudly, but does not weep; tears, however, are shed when
she is punished by her chair being turned with its back to the table.
This difference may perhaps be attributed to weeping being restrained,
as we shall immediately see, at a more advanced age, under most
circumstances excepting grief; and to the influence of such restraint
being transmitted to an earlier period of life, than that at which it
was first practised.

With adults, especially of the male sex, weeping soon ceases to be
caused by, or to express, bodily pain. This may be accounted for by its
being thought weak and unmanly by men, both of civilized and barbarous
races, to exhibit bodily pain by any outward sign. With this exception,
savages weep copiously from very slight causes, of which fact Sir J.
Lubbock[608] has collected instances. A New Zealand chief "cried like
a child because the sailors spoilt his favourite cloak by powdering it
with flour." I saw in Tierra del Fuego a native who had lately lost a
brother, and who alternately cried with hysterical violence, and laughed
heartily at anything which amused him. With the civilized nations
of Europe there is also much difference in the frequency of weeping.
Englishmen rarely cry, except under the pressure of the acutest grief;
whereas in some parts of the Continent the men shed tears much more
readily and freely.

The insane notoriously give way to all their emotions with little or no
restraint; and I am informed by Dr. J. Crichton Browne, that nothing is
more characteristic of simple melancholia, even in the male sex, than a
tendency to weep on the slightest occasions, or from no cause. They also
weep disproportionately on the occurrence of any real cause of grief.
The length of time during which some patients weep is astonishing, as
well as the amount of tears which they shed. One melancholic girl wept
for a whole day, and afterwards confessed to Dr. Browne, that it was
because she remembered that she had once shaved off her eyebrows to
promote their growth. Many patients in the asylum sit for a long time
rocking themselves backwards and forwards; "and if spoken to, they stop
their movements, purse up their eyes, depress the corners of the mouth,
and burst out crying." In some of these cases, the being spoken to or
kindly greeted appears to suggest some fanciful and sorrowful notion;
but in other cases an effort of any kind excites weeping, independently
of any sorrowful idea. Patients suffering from acute mania likewise
have paroxysms of violent crying or blubbering, in the midst of their
incoherent ravings. We must not, however, lay too much stress on the
copious shedding of tears by the insane, as being due to the lack of all
restraint; for certain brain-diseases, as hemiplegia, brain-wasting,
and senile decay, have a special tendency to induce weeping. Weeping is
common in the insane, even after a complete state of fatuity has been
reached and the power of speech lost. Persons born idiotic likewise
weep;[609] but it is said that this is not the case with cretins.

Weeping seems to be the primary and natural expression, as we see in
children, of suffering of any kind, whether bodily pain short of extreme
agony, or mental distress. But the foregoing facts and common experience
show us that a frequently repeated effort to restrain weeping, in
association with certain states of the mind, does much in checking the
habit. On the other hand, it appears that the power of weeping can be
increased through habit; thus the Rev. R. Taylor,[610] who long resided
in New Zealand, asserts that the women can voluntarily shed tears in
abundance; they meet for this purpose to mourn for the dead, and they
take pride in crying "in the most affecting manner."

A single effort of repression brought to bear on the lacrymal glands
does little, and indeed seems often to lead to an opposite result. An
old and experienced physician told me that he had always found that
the only means to check the occasional bitter weeping of ladies who
consulted him, and who themselves wished to desist, was earnestly to beg
them not to try, and to assure them that nothing would relieve them so
much as prolonged and copious crying.

The screaming of infants consists of prolonged expirations, with short
and rapid, almost spasmodic inspirations, followed at a somewhat more
advanced age by sobbing. According to Gratiolet,[611] the glottis is
chiefly affected during the act of sobbing. This sound is heard "at the
moment when the inspiration conquers the resistance of the glottis,
and the air rushes into the chest." But the whole act of respiration
is likewise spasmodic and violent. The shoulders are at the same time
generally raised, as by this movement respiration is rendered easier.
With one of my infants, when seventy-seven days old, the inspirations
were so rapid and strong that they approached in character to sobbing;
when 138 days old I first noticed distinct sobbing, which subsequently
followed every bad crying-fit. The respiratory movements are partly
voluntary and partly involuntary, and I apprehend that sobbing is at
least in part due to children having some power to command after early
infancy their vocal organs and to stop their screams, but from having
less power over their respiratory muscles, these continue for a time
to act in an involuntary or spasmodic manner, after having been brought
into violent action. Sobbing seems to be peculiar to the human species;
for the keepers in the Zoological Gardens assure me that they have never
heard a sob from any kind of monkey; though monkeys often scream loudly
whilst being chased and caught, and then pant for a long time. We thus
see that there is a close analogy between sobbing and the free shedding
of tears; for with children, sobbing does not commence during early
infancy, but afterwards comes on rather suddenly and then follows every
bad crying-fit, until the habit is checked with advancing years.

_On the cause of the contraction of the muscles round the eyes during
screaming_.--We have seen that infants and young children, whilst
screaming, invariably close their eyes firmly, by the contraction of the
surrounding muscles, so that the skin becomes wrinkled all around. With
older children, and even with adults, whenever there is violent and
unrestrained crying, a tendency to the contraction of these same muscles
may be observed; though this is often checked in order not to interfere
with vision.

Sir C. Bell explains[612] this action in the following manner:--"During
every violent act of expiration, whether in hearty laughter, weeping,
coughing, or sneezing, the eyeball is firmly compressed by the fibres
of the orbicularis; and this is a provision for supporting and defending
the vascular system of the interior of the eye from a retrograde impulse
communicated to the blood in the veins at that time. When we contract
the chest and expel the air, there is a retardation of the blood in the
veins of the neck and head; and in the more powerful acts of expulsion,
the blood not only distends the vessels, but is even regurgitated into
the minute branches. Were the eye not properly compressed at that
time, and a resistance given to the shock, irreparable injury might
be inflicted on the delicate textures of the interior of the eye." He
further adds, "If we separate the eyelids of a child to examine the eye,
while it cries and struggles with passion, by taking off the natural
support to the vascular system of the eye, and means of guarding it
against the rush of blood then occurring, the conjunctiva becomes
suddenly filled with blood, and the eyelids everted."

Not only are the muscles round the eyes strongly contracted, as Sir
C. Bell states and as I have often observed, during screaming, loud
laughter, coughing, and sneezing, but during several other analogous
actions. A man contracts these muscles when he violently blows his nose.
I asked one of my boys to shout as loudly as he possibly could, and as
soon as he began, he firmly contracted his orbicular muscles; I observed
this repeatedly, and on asking him why he had every time so firmly
closed his eyes, I found that he was quite unaware of the fact: he had
acted instinctively or unconsciously.

It is not necessary, in order to lead to the contraction of these
muscles, that air should actually be expelled from the chest; it
suffices that the muscles of the chest and abdomen should contract with
great force, whilst by the closure of the glottis no air escapes. In
violent vomiting or retching the diaphragm is made to descend by the
chest being filled with air; it is then held in this position by the
closure of the glottis, "as well as by the contraction of its own
fibres."[613] The abdominal muscles now contract strongly upon the
stomach, its proper muscles likewise contracting, and the contents are
thus ejected. During each effort of vomiting "the head becomes greatly
congested, so that the features are red and swollen, and the large veins
of the face and temples visibly dilated." At the same time, as I know
from observation, the muscles round the eyes are strongly contracted.
This is likewise the case when the abdominal muscles act downwards with
unusual force in expelling the contents of the intestinal canal.

The greatest exertion of the muscles of the body, if those of the chest
are not brought into strong action in expelling or compressing the air
within the lungs, does not lead to the contraction of the muscles
round the eyes. I have observed my sons using great force in gymnastic
exercises, as in repeatedly raising their suspended bodies by their
arms alone, and in lifting heavy weights from the ground, but there was
hardly any trace of contraction in the muscles round the eyes.

As the contraction of these muscles for the protection of the eyes
during violent expiration is indirectly, as we shall hereafter see, a
fundamental element in several of our most important expressions, I
was extremely anxious to ascertain how far Sir C. Bell's view could be
substantiated. Professor Donders, of Utrecht,[614] well known as one of
the highest authorities in Europe on vision and on the structure of the
eye, has most kindly undertaken for me this investigation with the aid
of the many ingenious mechanisms of modern science, and has published
the results.[615] He shows that during violent expiration the external,
the intra-ocular, and the retro-ocular vessels of the eye are all
affected in two ways, namely by the increased pressure of the blood in
the arteries, and by the return of the blood in the veins being impeded.
It is, therefore, certain that both the arteries and the veins of the
eye are more or less distended during violent expiration. The evidence
in detail may be found in Professor Donders' valuable memoir. We see the
effects on the veins of the head, in their prominence, and in the purple
colour of the face of a man who coughs violently from being half choked.
I may mention, on the same authority, that the whole eye certainly
advances a little during each violent expiration. This is due to the
dilatation of the retro-ocular vessels, and might have been expected
from the intimate connection of the eye and brain; the brain being known
to rise and fall with each respiration, when a portion of the skull has
been removed; and as may be seen along the unclosed sutures of infants'
heads. This also, I presume, is the reason that the eyes of a strangled
man appear as if they were starting from their sockets.

With respect to the protection of the eye during violent expiratory
efforts by the pressure of the eyelids, Professor Donders concludes from
his various observations that this action certainly limits or entirely
removes the dilatation of the vessels.[616] At such times, he adds, we
not unfrequently see the hand involuntarily laid upon the eyelids, as if
the better to support and defend the eyeball.

Nevertheless much evidence cannot at present be advanced to prove that
the eye actually suffers injury from the want of support during violent
expiration; but there is some. It is "a fact that forcible expiratory
efforts in violent coughing or vomiting, and especially in sneezing,
sometimes give rise to ruptures of the little (external) vessels" of the
eye.[617] With respect to the internal vessels, Dr. Gunning has lately
recorded a case of exophthalmos in consequence of whooping-cough,
which in his opinion depended on the rupture of the deeper vessels; and
another analogous case has been recorded. But a mere sense of discomfort
would probably suffice to lead to the associated habit of protecting
the eyeball by the contraction of the surrounding muscles. Even the
expectation or chance of injury would probably be sufficient, in the
same manner as an object moving too near the eye induces involuntary
winking of the eyelids. We may, therefore, safely conclude from Sir
C. Bell's observations, and more especially from the more careful
investigations by Professor Donders, that the firm closure of the
eyelids during the screaming of children is an action full of meaning
and of real service.

We have already seen that the contraction of the orbicular muscles leads
to the drawing up of the upper lip, and consequently, if the mouth is
kept widely open, to the drawing down of the corners by the contraction
of the depressor muscles. The formation of the naso-labial fold on the
cheeks likewise follows from the drawing up of the upper lip. Thus all
the chief expressive movements of the face during crying apparently
result from the contraction of the muscles round the eyes. We shall also
find that the shedding of tears depends on, or at least stands in some
connection with, the contraction of these same muscles.

In some of the foregoing cases, especially in those of sneezing and
coughing, it is possible that the contraction of the orbicular muscles
may serve in addition to protect the eyes from too severe a jar or
vibration. I think so, because dogs and cats, in crunching hard bones,
always close their eyelids, and at least sometimes in sneezing; though
dogs do not do so whilst barking loudly. Mr. Sutton carefully observed
for me a young orang and chimpanzee, and he found that both always
closed their eyes in sneezing and coughing, but not whilst screaming
violently. I gave a small pinch of snuff to a monkey of the American
division, namely, a Cebus, and it closed its eyelids whilst sneezing;
but not on a subsequent occasion whilst uttering loud cries.

_Cause of the secretion of tears_.--It is an important fact which must
be considered in any theory of the secretion of tears from the mind
being affected, that whenever the muscles round the eyes are strongly
and involuntarily contracted in order to compress the blood-vessels
and thus to protect the eyes, tears are secreted, often in sufficient
abundance to roll down the cheeks. This occurs under the most opposite
emotions, and under no emotion at all. The sole exception, and this
is only a partial one, to the existence of a relation between the
involuntary and strong contraction of these muscles and the secretion
of tears is that of young infants, who, whilst screaming violently
with their eyelids firmly closed, do not commonly weep until they
have attained the age of from two to three or four months. Their eyes,
however, become suffused with tears at a much earlier age. It would
appear, as already remarked, that the lacrymal glands do not, from the
want of practice or some other cause, come to full functional activity
at a very early period of life. With children at a somewhat later age,
crying out or wailing from any distress is so regularly accompanied
by the shedding of tears, that weeping and crying are synonymous
terms.[618]

Under the opposite emotion of great joy or amusement, as long as
laughter is moderate there is hardly any contraction of the muscles
round the eyes, so that there is no frowning; but when peals of loud
laughter are uttered, with rapid and violent spasmodic expirations,
tears stream down the face. I have more than once noticed the face of a
person, after a paroxysm of violent laughter, and I could see that
the orbicular muscles and those running to the upper lip were still
partially contracted, which together with the tear-stained cheeks gave
to the upper half of the face an expression not to be distinguished from
that of a child still blubbering from grief. The fact of tears streaming
down the face during violent laughter is common to all the races of
mankind, as we shall see in a future chapter.

In violent coughing especially when a person is half-choked, the face
becomes purple, the veins distended, the orbicular muscles strongly
contracted, and tears run down the cheeks. Even after a fit of ordinary
coughing, almost every one has to wipe his eyes. In violent vomiting or
retching, as I have myself experienced and seen in others, the orbicular
muscles are strongly contracted, and tears sometimes flow freely
down the cheeks. It has been suggested to me that this may be due to
irritating matter being injected into the nostrils, and causing by
reflex action the secretion of tears. Accordingly I asked one of my
informants, a surgeon, to attend to the effects of retching when nothing
was thrown up from the stomach; and, by an odd coincidence, he himself
suffered the next morning from an attack of retching, and three days
subsequently observed a lady under a similar attack; and he is certain
that in neither case an atom of matter was ejected from the stomach;
yet the orbicular muscles were strongly contracted, and tears freely
secreted. I can also speak positively to the energetic contraction of
these same muscles round the eyes, and to the coincident free secretion
of tears, when the abdominal muscles act with unusual force in a
downward direction on the intestinal canal.

Yawning commences with a deep inspiration, followed by a long and
forcible expiration; and at the same time almost all the muscles of the
body are strongly contracted, including those round the eyes. During
this act tears are often secreted, and I have seen them even rolling
down the cheeks.

I have frequently observed that when persons scratch some point which
itches intolerably, they forcibly close their eyelids; but they do not,
as I believe, first draw a deep breath and then expel it with force; and
I have never noticed that the eyes then become filled with tears; but I
am not prepared to assert that this does not occur. The forcible closure
of the eyelids is, perhaps, merely a part of that general action by
which almost all the muscles of the body are at the same time rendered
rigid. It is quite different from the gentle closure of the eyes which
often accompanies, as Gratiolet remarks,[619] the smelling a delicious
odour, or the tasting a delicious morsel, and which probably originates
in the desire to shut out any disturbing impression through the eyes.

Professor Donders writes to me to the following effect: "I have
observed some cases of a very curious affection when, after a slight rub
(_attouchement_), for example, from the friction of a coat, which
caused neither a wound nor a contusion, spasms of the orbicular muscles
occurred, with a very profuse flow of tears, lasting about one hour.
Subsequently, sometimes after an interval of several weeks, violent
spasms of the same muscles re-occurred, accompanied by the secretion
of tears, together with primary or secondary redness of the eye." Mr.
Bowman informs me that he has occasionally observed closely analogous
cases, and that, in some of these, there was no redness or inflammation
of the eyes.

I was anxious to ascertain whether there existed in any of the lower
animals a similar relation between the contraction of the orbicular
muscles during violent expiration and the secretion of tears; but there
are very few animals which contract these muscles in a prolonged manner,
or which shed tears. _The Macacus maurus_, which formerly wept so
copiously in the Zoological Gardens, would have been a fine case for
observation; but the two monkeys now there, and which are believed
to belong to the same species, do not weep. Nevertheless they were
carefully observed by Mr. Bartlett and myself, whilst screaming loudly,
and they seemed to contract these muscles; but they moved about their
cages so rapidly, that it was difficult to observe with certainty. No
other monkey, as far as I have been able to ascertain, contracts its
orbicular muscles whilst screaming.

The Indian elephant is known sometimes to weep. Sir E. Tennent, in
describing these which he saw captured and bound in Ceylon, says, some
"lay motionless on the ground, with no other indication of suffering
than the tears which suffused their eyes and flowed incessantly."
Speaking of another elephant he says, "When overpowered and made fast,
his grief was most affecting; his violence sank to utter prostration,
and he lay on the ground, uttering choking cries, with tears trickling
down his cheeks."[620] In the Zoological Gardens the keeper of the
Indian elephants positively asserts that he has several times seen tears
rolling down the face of the old female, when distressed by the removal
of the young one. Hence I was extremely anxious to ascertain, as an
extension of the relation between the contraction of the orbicular
muscles and the shedding of tears in man, whether elephants when
screaming or trumpeting loudly contract these muscles. At Mr. Bartlett's
desire the keeper ordered the old and the young elephant to trumpet; and
we repeatedly saw in both animals that, just as the trumpeting began,
the orbicular muscles, especially the lower ones, were distinctly
contracted. On a subsequent occasion the keeper made the old elephant
trumpet much more loudly, and invariably both the upper and lower
orbicular muscles were strongly contracted, and now in an equal degree.
It is a singular fact that the African elephant, which, however, is so
different from the Indian species that it is placed by some naturalists
in a distinct sub-genus, when made on two occasions to trumpet loudly,
exhibited no trace of the contraction of the orbicular muscles.

From the several foregoing cases with respect to Man, there can, I
think, be no doubt that the contraction of the muscles round the
eyes, during violent expiration or when the expanded chest is forcibly
compressed, is, in some manner, intimately connected with the secretion
of tears. This holds good under widely different emotions, and
independently of any emotion. It is not, of course, meant that tears
cannot be secreted without the contraction of these muscles; for it is
notorious that they are often freely shed with the eyelids not closed,
and with the brows unwrinkled. The contraction must be both involuntary
and prolonged, as during a choking fit, or energetic, as during a
sneeze. The mere involuntary winking of the eyelids, though often
repeated, does not bring tears into the eyes. Nor does the voluntary and
prolonged contraction of the several surrounding muscles suffice. As the
lacrymal glands of children are easily excited, I persuaded my own
and several other children of different ages to contract these muscles
repeatedly with their utmost force, and to continue doing so as long
as they possibly could; but this produced hardly any effect. There was
sometimes a little moisture in the eyes, but not more than apparently
could be accounted for by the squeezing out of the already secreted
tears within the glands.

The nature of the relation between the involuntary and energetic
contraction of the muscles round the eyes, and the secretion of tears,
cannot be positively ascertained, but a probable view may be suggested.
The primary function of the secretion of tears, together with some
mucus, is to lubricate the surface of the eye; and a secondary one, as
some believe, is to keep the nostrils damp, so that the inhaled air
may be moist,[621] and likewise to favour the power of smelling. But
another, and at least equally important function of tears, is to wash
out particles of dust or other minute objects which may get into the
eyes. That this is of great importance is clear from the cases in which
the cornea has been rendered opaque through inflammation, caused by
particles of dust not being removed, in consequence of the eye and
eyelid becoming immovable.[622] The secretion of tears from the
irritation of any foreign body in the eye is a reflex action;--that
is, the body irritates a peripheral nerve which sends an impression to
certain sensory nerve-cells; these transmit an influence to other cells,
and these again to the lacrymal glands. The influence transmitted to
these glands causes, as there is good reason to believe, the relaxation
of the muscular coats of the smaller arteries; this allows more blood
to permeate the glandular tissue, and this induces a free secretion
of tears. When the small arteries of the face, including those of the
retina, are relaxed under very different circumstances, namely, during
an intense blush, the lacrymal glands are sometimes affected in a like
manner, for the eyes become suffused with tears.

It is difficult to conjecture how many reflex actions have originated,
but, in relation to the present case of the affection of the lacrymal
glands through irritation of the surface of the eye, it may be worth
remarking that, as soon as some primordial form became semi-terrestrial
in its habits, and was liable to get particles of dust into its eyes, if
these were not washed out they would cause much irritation; and on the
principle of the radiation of nerve-force to adjoining nerve-cells, the
lacrymal glands would be stimulated to secretion. As this would often
recur, and as nerve-force readily passes along accustomed channels, a
slight irritation would ultimately suffice to cause a free secretion of
tears.

As soon as by this, or by some other means, a reflex action of this
nature had been established and rendered easy, other stimulants applied
to the surface of the eye--such as a cold wind, slow inflammatory
action, or a blow on the eyelids--would cause a copious secretion of
tears, as we know to be the case. The glands are also excited into
action through the irritation of adjoining parts. Thus when the nostrils
are irritated by pungent vapours, though the eyelids may be kept firmly
closed, tears are copiously secreted; and this likewise follows from a
blow on the nose, for instance from a boxing-glove. A stinging switch
on the face produces, as I have seen, the same effect. In these latter
cases the secretion of tears is an incidental result, and of no direct
service. As all these parts of the face, including the lacrymal glands,
are supplied with branches of the same nerve, namely, the fifth, it is
in some degree intelligible that the effects of the excitement of
any one branch should spread to the nerve-cells or roots of the other
branches.

The internal parts of the eye likewise act, under certain conditions,
in a reflex manner on the lacrymal glands. The following statements have
been kindly communicated to me by Mr. Bowman; but the subject is a very
intricate one, as all the parts of the eye are so intimately related
together, and are so sensitive to various stimulants. A strong light
acting on the retina, when in a normal condition, has very little
tendency to cause lacrymation; but with unhealthy children having
small, old-standing ulcers on the cornea, the retina becomes excessively
sensitive to light, and exposure even to common daylight causes forcible
and sustained closure of the lids, and a profuse flow of tears. When
persons who ought to begin the use of convex glasses habitually strain
the waning power of accommodation, an undue secretion of tears very
often follows, and the retina is liable to become unduly sensitive to
light. In general, morbid affections of the surface of the eye, and of
the ciliary structures concerned in the accommodative act, are prone
to be accompanied with excessive secretion of tears. Hardness of the
eyeball, not rising to inflammation, but implying a want of balance
between the fluids poured out and again taken up by the intra-ocular
vessels, is not usually attended with any lacrymation. When the balance
is on the other side, and the eye becomes too soft, there is a greater
tendency to lacrymation. Finally, there are numerous morbid states and
structural alterations of the eyes, and even terrible inflammations,
which may be attended with little or no secretion of tears.

It also deserves notice, as indirectly bearing on our subject, that the
eye and adjoining parts are subject to an extraordinary number of
reflex and associated movements, sensations, and actions, besides those
relating to the lacrymal glands. When a bright light strikes the retina
of one eye alone, the iris contracts, but the iris of the other eye
moves after a measurable interval of time. The iris likewise moves in
accommodation to near or distant vision, and when the two eyes are made
to converge.[623] Every one knows how irresistibly the eyebrows
are drawn down under an intensely bright light. The eyelids also
involuntarily wink when an object is moved near the eyes, or a sound
is suddenly heard. The well-known case of a bright light causing some
persons to sneeze is even more curious; for nerve-force here radiates
from certain nerve-cells in connection with the retina, to the sensory
nerve-cells of the nose, causing it to tickle; and from these, to the
cells which command the various respiratory muscles (the orbiculars
included) which expel the air in so peculiar a manner that it rushes
through the nostrils alone.

To return to our point: why are tears secreted during a screaming-fit or
other violent expiratory efforts? As a slight blow on the eyelids causes
a copious secretion of tears, it is at least possible that the spasmodic
contraction of the eyelids, by pressing strongly on the eyeball, should
in a similar manner cause some secretion. This seems possible, although
the voluntary contraction of the same muscles does not produce any
such effect. We know that a man cannot voluntarily sneeze or cough with
nearly the same force as he does automatically; and so it is with the
contraction of the orbicular muscles: Sir C. Bell experimented on them,
and found that by suddenly and forcibly closing the eyelids in the dark,
sparks of light are seen, like those caused by tapping the eyelids with
the fingers; "but in sneezing the compression is both more rapid and
more forcible, and the sparks are more brilliant." That these sparks
are due to the contraction of the eyelids is clear, because if they
"are held open during the act of sneezing, no sensation of light will be
experienced." In the peculiar cases referred to by Professor Donders
and Mr. Bowman, we have seen that some weeks after the eye has been very
slightly injured, spasmodic contractions of the eyelids ensue, and these
are accompanied by a profuse flow of tears. In the act of yawning, the
tears are apparently due solely to the spasmodic contraction of the
muscles round the eyes. Notwithstanding these latter cases, it seems
hardly credible that the pressure of the eyelids on the surface of the
eye, although effected spasmodically and therefore with much greater
force than can be done voluntarily, should be sufficient to cause by
reflex action the secretion of tears in the many cases in which this
occurs during violent expiratory efforts.

Another cause may come conjointly into play. We have seen that the
internal parts of the eye, under certain conditions act in a reflex
manner on the lacrymal glands. We know that during violent expiratory
efforts the pressure of the arterial blood within the vessels of the
eye is increased, and that the return of the venous blood is impeded.
It seems, therefore, not improbable that the distension of the
ocular vessels, thus induced, might act by reflection on the lacrymal
glands--the effects due to the spasmodic pressure of the eyelids on the
surface of the eye being thus increased.

In considering how far this view is probable, we should bear in mind
that the eyes of infants have been acted on in this double manner
during numberless generations, whenever they have screamed; and on the
principle of nerve-force readily passing along accustomed channels, even
a moderate compression of the eyeballs and a moderate distension of
the ocular vessels would ultimately come, through habit, to act on the
glands. We have an analogous case in the orbicular muscles being
almost always contracted in some slight degree, even during a gentle
crying-fit, when there can be no distension of the vessels and no
uncomfortable sensation excited within the eyes.

Moreover, when complex actions or movements have long been performed
in strict association together, and these are from any cause at first
voluntarily and afterwards habitually checked, then if the proper
exciting conditions occur, any part of the action or movement which is
least under the control of the will, will often still be involuntarily
performed. The secretion by a gland is remarkably free from the
influence of the will; therefore, when with the advancing age of the
individual, or with the advancing culture of the race, the habit of
crying out or screaming is restrained, and there is consequently no
distension of the blood-vessels of the eye, it may nevertheless well
happen that tears should still be secreted. We may see, as lately
remarked, the muscles round the eyes of a person who reads a pathetic
story, twitching or trembling in so slight a degree as hardly to be
detected. In this case there has been no screaming and no distension of
the blood-vessels, yet through habit certain nerve-cells send a small
amount of nerve-force to the cells commanding the muscles round the
eyes; and they likewise send some to the cells commanding the lacrymal
glands, for the eyes often become at the same time just moistened with
tears. If the twitching of the muscles round the eyes and the secretion
of tears had been completely prevented, nevertheless it is almost
certain that there would have been some tendency to transmit nerve-force
in these same directions; and as the lacrymal glands are remarkably free
from the control of the will, they would be eminently liable still
to act, thus betraying, though there were no other outward signs, the
pathetic thoughts which were passing through the person's mind.

As a further illustration of the view here advanced, I may remark that
if, during an early period of life, when habits of all kinds are readily
established, our infants, when pleased, had been accustomed to utter
loud peals of laughter (during which the vessels of their eyes are
distended) as often and as continuously as they have yielded when
distressed to screaming-fits, then it is probable that in after life
tears would have been as copiously and as regularly secreted under the
one state of mind as under the other. Gentle laughter, or a smile,
or even a pleasing thought, would have sufficed to cause a moderate
secretion of tears. There does indeed exist an evident tendency in this
direction, as will be seen in a future chapter, when we treat of
the tender feelings. With the Sandwich Islanders, according to
Freycinet,[624] tears are actually recognized as a sign of happiness;
but we should require better evidence on this head than that of a
passing voyager. So again if our infants, during many generations,
and each of them during several years, had almost daily suffered
from prolonged choking-fits, during which the vessels of the eye are
distended and tears copiously secreted, then it is probable, such is the
force of associated habit, that during after life the mere thought of a
choke, without any distress of mind, would have sufficed to bring tears
into our eyes.

To sum up this chapter, weeping is probably the result of some such
chain of events as follows. Children, when wanting food or suffering in
any way, cry out loudly, like the young of most other animals, partly
as a call to their parents for aid, and partly from any great exertion
serving relief. Prolonged screaming inevitably leads to the gorging
of the blood-vessels of the eye; and this will have led, at first
consciously and at last habitually, to the contraction of the muscles
round the eyes in order to protect them. At the same time the spasmodic
pressure on the surface of the eye, and the distension of the vessels
within the eye, without necessarily entailing any conscious sensation,
will have affected, through reflex action, the lacrymal glands. Finally,
through the three principles of nerve-force readily passing along
accustomed channels--of association, which is so widely extended in its
power--and of certain actions, being more under the control of the
will than others--it has come to pass that suffering readily causes the
secretion of tears, without being necessarily accompanied by any other
action.

Although in accordance with this view we must look at weeping as an
incidental result, as purposeless as the secretion of tears from a blow
outside the eye, or as a sneeze from the retina being affected by
a bright light, yet this does not present any difficulty in our
understanding how the secretion of tears serves as a relief to
suffering. And by as much as the weeping is more violent or hysterical,
by so much will the relief be greater,--on the same principle that the
writhing of the whole body, the grinding of the teeth, and the uttering
of piercing shrieks, all give relief under an agony of pain.



CHAPTER VII. -- LOW SPIRITS, ANXIETY, GRIEF, DEJECTION, DESPAIR.

General effect of grief on the system--Obliquity of the eyebrows
under suffering--On the cause of the obliquity of the eyebrows--On the
depression of the corners of the mouth.


AFTER the mind has suffered from an acute paroxysm of grief, and the
cause still continues, we fall into a state of low spirits; or we may be
utterly cast down and dejected. Prolonged bodily pain, if not amounting
to an agony, generally leads to the same state of mind. If we expect to
suffer, we are anxious; if we have no hope of relief, we despair.

Persons suffering from excessive grief often seek relief by violent and
almost frantic movements, as described in a former chapter; but when
their suffering is somewhat mitigated, yet prolonged, they no longer
wish for action, but remain motionless and passive, or may occasionally
rock themselves to and fro. The circulation becomes languid; the face
pale; the muscles flaccid; the eyelids droop; the head hangs on the
contracted chest; the lips, cheeks, and lower jaw all sink downwards
from their own weight. Hence all the features are lengthened; and the
face of a person who hears bad news is said to fall. A party of natives
in Tierra del Fuego endeavoured to explain to us that their friend, the
captain of a sealing vessel, was out of spirits, by pulling down their
cheeks with both hands, so as to make their faces as long as possible.
Mr. Bunnet informs me that the Australian aborigines when out of spirits
have a chop-fallen appearance. After prolonged suffering the eyes become
dull and lack expression, and are often slightly suffused with tears.
The eyebrows not rarely are rendered oblique, which is due to their
inner ends being raised. This produces peculiarly-formed wrinkles on the
forehead, which are very different from those of a simple frown; though
in some cases a frown alone may be present. The comers of the mouth are
drawn downwards, which is so universally recognized as a sign of being
out of spirits, that it is almost proverbial.

The breathing becomes slow and feeble, and is often interrupted by deep
sighs. As Gratiolet remarks, whenever our attention is long concentrated
on any subject, we forget to breathe, and then relieve ourselves by a
deep inspiration; but the sighs of a sorrowful person, owing to his slow
respiration and languid circulation, are eminently characteristic.[701]
As the grief of a person in this state occasionally recurs and increases
into a paroxysm, spasms affect the respiratory muscles, and he feels
as if something, the so-called _globus hystericus_, was rising in his
throat. These spasmodic movements are clearly allied to the sobbing of
children, and are remnants of those severer spasms which occur when a
person is said to choke from excessive grief.[702]


_Obliquity of the eyebrows_.--Two points alone in the above description
require further elucidation, and these are very curious ones; namely,
the raising of the inner ends of the eyebrows, and the drawing down
of the corners of the mouth. With respect to the eyebrows, they may
occasionally be seen to assume an oblique position in persons suffering
from deep dejection or anxiety; for instance, I have observed this
movement in a mother whilst speaking about her sick son; and it is
sometimes excited by quite trifling or momentary causes of real or
pretended distress. The eyebrows assume this position owing to the
contraction of certain muscles (namely, the orbiculars, corrugators, and
pyramidals of the nose, which together tend to lower and contract the
eyebrows) being partially cheeked by the more powerful action of the
central fasciæ of the frontal muscle. These latter fasciæ by their
contraction raise the inner ends alone of the eyebrows; and as the
corrugators at the same time draw the eyebrows together, their inner
ends become puckered into a fold or lump. This fold is a highly
characteristic point in the appearance of the eyebrows when rendered
oblique, as may be seen in figs. 2 and 5, Plate II. The eyebrows are
at the same time somewhat roughened, owing to the hairs being made to
project. Dr. J. Crichton Browne has also often noticed in melancholic
patients who keep their eyebrows persistently oblique, "a peculiar
acute arching of the upper eyelid." A trace of this may be observed by
comparing the right and left eyelids of the young man in the photograph
(fig. 2, Plate II.); for he was not able to act equally on both
eyebrows. This is also shown by the unequal furrows on the two sides of
his forehead. The acute arching of the eyelids depends, I believe, on
the inner end alone of the eyebrows being raised; for when the whole
eyebrow is elevated and arched, the upper eyelid follows in a slight
degree the same movement.

[Illustration:  Obliquity of the eyebrows. Plate II]

But the most conspicuous result of the opposed contraction of the
above-named muscles, is exhibited by the peculiar furrows formed on the
forehead. These muscles, when thus in conjoint yet opposed action, may
be called, for the sake of brevity, the grief-muscles. When a person
elevates his eyebrows by the contraction of the whole frontal muscle,
transverse wrinkles extend across the whole breadth of the forehead;
but in the present case the middle fasciae alone are contracted;
consequently, transverse furrows are formed across the middle part alone
of the forehead. The skin over the exterior parts of both eyebrows is
at the same time drawn downwards and smooth, by the contraction of
the outer portions of the orbicular muscles. The eyebrows are
likewise brought together through the simultaneous contraction of the
corrugators;[703] and this latter action generates vertical furrows,
separating the exterior and lowered part of the skin of the forehead
from the central and raised part. The union of these vertical furrows
with the central and transverse furrows (see figs. 2 and 3) produces a
mark on the forehead which has been compared to a horse-shoe; but the
furrows more strictly form three sides of a quadrangle. They are often
conspicuous on the foreheads of adult or nearly adult persons, when
their eyebrows are made oblique; but with young children, owing to their
skin not easily wrinkling, they are rarely seen, or mere traces of them
can be detected.

These peculiar furrows are best represented in fig. 3, Plate II., on
the forehead of a young lady who has the power in an unusual degree of
voluntarily acting on the requisite muscles. As she was absorbed in the
attempt, whilst being photographed, her expression was not at all one
of grief; I have therefore given the forehead alone. Fig. 1 on the same
plate, copied from Dr. Du-chenne's work,[704] represents, on a reduced
scale, the face, in its natural state, of a young man who was a good
actor. In fig. 2 he is shown simulating grief, but the two eyebrows, as
before remarked, are not equally acted on. That the expression is true,
may be inferred from the fact that out of fifteen persons, to whom the
original photograph was shown, without any clue to what was intended
being given them, fourteen immediately answered, "despairing sorrow,"
"suffering endurance," "melancholy," and so forth. The history of fig. 5
is rather curious: I saw the photograph in a shop-window, and took it
to Mr. Rejlander for the sake of finding out by whom it had been made;
remarking to him how pathetic the expression was. He answered, "I made
it, and it was likely to be pathetic, for the boy in a few minutes burst
out crying." He then showed me a photograph of the same boy in a placid
state, which I have had (fig. 4) reproduced. In fig. 6, a trace of
obliquity in the eyebrows may be detected; but this figure, as well as
fig. 7, is given to show the depression of the corners of the mouth, to
which subject I shall presently refer.

Few persons, without some practice, can voluntarily act on their
grief-muscles; but after repeated trials a considerable number succeed,
whilst others never can. The degree of obliquity in the eyebrows,
whether assumed voluntarily or unconsciously, differs much in different
persons. With some who apparently have unusually strong pyramidal
muscles, the contraction of the central fasciae of the frontal muscle,
although it may be energetic, as shown by the quadrangular furrows on
the forehead, does not raise the inner ends of the eyebrows, but only
prevents their being so much lowered as they otherwise would have been.
As far as I have been able to observe, the grief-muscles are brought
into action much more frequently by children and women than by men. They
are rarely acted on, at least with grown-up persons, from bodily pain,
but almost exclusively from mental distress. Two persons who, after some
practice, succeeded in acting on their grief-muscles, found by
looking at a mirror that when they made their eyebrows oblique, they
unintentionally at the same time depressed the corners of their mouths;
and this is often the case when the expression is naturally assumed.

The power to bring the grief-muscles freely into play appears to be
hereditary, like almost every other human faculty. A lady belonging to
a family famous for having produced an extraordinary number of great
actors and actresses, and who can herself give this expression "with
singular precision," told Dr. Crichton Browne that all her family had
possessed the power in a remarkable degree. The same hereditary tendency
is said to have extended, as I likewise hear from Dr. Browne, to the
last descendant of the family, which gave rise to Sir Walter Scott's
novel of 'Red Gauntlet;' but the hero is described as contracting his
forehead into a horseshoe mark from any strong emotion. I have also seen
a young woman whose forehead seemed almost habitually thus contracted,
independently of any emotion being at the time felt.

The grief-muscles are not very frequently brought into play; and as the
action is often momentary, it easily escapes observation. Although the
expression, when observed, is universally and instantly recognized as
that of grief or anxiety, yet not one person out of a thousand who has
never studied the subject, is able to say precisely what change passes
over the sufferer's face. Hence probably it is that this expression is
not even alluded to, as far as I have noticed, in any work of fiction,
with the exception of 'Red Gauntlet' and of one other novel; and the
authoress of the latter, as I am informed, belongs to the famous family
of actors just alluded to; so that her attention may have been specially
called to the subject.

The ancient Greek sculptors were familiar with the expression, as shown
in the statues of the Laocoon and Arretino; but, as Duchenne remarks,
they carried the transverse furrows across the whole breadth of the
forehead, and thus committed a great anatomical mistake: this is
likewise the case in some modern statues. It is, however, more probable
that these wonderfully accurate observers intentionally sacrificed truth
for the sake of beauty, than that they made a mistake; for rectangular
furrows on the forehead would not have had a grand appearance on the
marble. The expression, in its fully developed condition, is, as far as
I can discover, not often represented in pictures by the old masters, no
doubt owing to the same cause; but a lady who is perfectly familiar with
this expression, informs me that in Fra Angelico's 'Descent from the
Cross' in Florence, it is clearly exhibited in one of the figures on the
right-hand; and I could add a few other instances.

Dr. Crichton Browne, at my request, closely attended to this expression
in the numerous insane patients under his care in the West Biding
Asylum; and he is familiar with Duchenne's photographs of the action
of the grief-muscles. He informs me that they may constantly be seen
in energetic action in cases of melancholia, and especially of
hypochondria; and that the persistent lines or furrows, due to their
habitual contraction, are characteristic of the physiognomy of the
insane belonging to these two classes. Dr. Browne carefully observed for
me during a considerable period three cases of hypochondria, in which
the grief-muscles were persistently contracted. In one of these, a
widow, aged 51, fancied that she had lost all her viscera, and that her
whole body was empty. She wore an expression of great distress, and beat
her semi-closed hands rhythmically together for hours. The grief-muscles
were permanently contracted, and the upper eyelids arched. This
condition lasted for months; she then recovered, and her countenance
resumed its natural expression. A second case presented nearly the
same peculiarities, with the addition that the comers of the mouth were
depressed.

Mr. Patrick Nicol has also kindly observed for me several cases in the
Sussex Lunatic Asylum, and has communicated to me full details with
respect to three of them; but they need not here be given. From his
observations on melancholic patients, Mr. Nicol concludes that the inner
ends of the eyebrows are almost always more or less raised, with the
wrinkles on the forehead more or less plainly marked. In the case of one
young woman, these wrinkles were observed to be in constant slight play
or movement. In some cases the comers of the mouth are depressed,
but often only in a slight degree. Some amount of difference in the
expression of the several melancholic patients could almost always be
observed. The eyelids generally droop; and the skin near their outer
comers and beneath them is wrinkled. The naso-labial fold, which runs
from the wings of the nostrils to the comers of the mouth, and which is
so conspicuous in blubbering children, is often plainly marked in these
patients.

Although with the insane the grief-muscles often act persistently;
yet in ordinary cases they are sometimes brought unconsciously into
momentary action by ludicrously slight causes. A gentleman rewarded a
young lady by an absurdly small present; she pretended to be offended,
and as she upbraided him, her eyebrows became extremely oblique, with
the forehead properly wrinkled. Another young lady and a youth, both in
the highest spirits, were eagerly talking together with extraordinary
rapidity; and I noticed that, as often as the young lady was beaten,
and could not get out her words fast enough, her eyebrows went obliquely
upwards, and rectangular furrows were formed on her forehead. She thus
each time hoisted a flag of distress; and this she did half-a-dozen
times in the course of a few minutes. I made no remark on the subject,
but on a subsequent occasion I asked her to act on her grief-muscles;
another girl who was present, and who could do so voluntarily, showing
her what was intended. She tried repeatedly, but utterly failed; yet
so slight a cause of distress as not being able to talk quickly enough,
sufficed to bring these muscles over and over again into energetic
action.

The expression of grief, due to the contraction of the grief-muscles, is
by no means confined to Europeans, but appears to be common to all the
races of mankind. I have, at least, received trustworthy accounts in
regard to Hindoos, Dhangars (one of the aboriginal hill-tribes of India,
and therefore belonging to a quite distinct race from the Hindoos),
Malays, Negroes and Australians. With respect to the latter, two
observers answer my query in the affirmative, but enter into no details.
Mr. Taplin, however, appends to my descriptive remarks the words
"this is exact." With respect to negroes, the lady who told me of Fra
Angelico's picture, saw a negro towing a boat on the Nile, and as he
encountered an obstruction, she observed his grief-muscles in strong
action, with the middle of the forehead well wrinkled. Mr. Geach watched
a Malay man in Malacca, with the comers of his mouth much depressed,
the eyebrows oblique, with deep short grooves on the forehead. This
expression lasted for a very short time; and Mr. Geach remarks it "was
a strange one, very much like a person about to cry at some great loss."

In India Mr. H. Erskine found that the natives were familiar with this
expression; and Mr. J. Scott, of the Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, has
obligingly sent me a full description of two cases. He observed during
some time, himself unseen, a very young Dhangar woman from Nag-pore, the
wife of one of the gardeners, nursing her baby who was at the point of
death; and he distinctly saw the eyebrows raised at the inner comers,
the eyelids drooping, the forehead wrinkled in the middle, the mouth
slightly open, with the comers much depressed. He then came from behind
a screen of plants and spoke to the poor woman, who started, burst into
a bitter flood of tears, and besought him to cure her baby. The second
case was that of a Hindustani man, who from illness and poverty was
compelled to sell his favourite goat. After receiving the money, he
repeatedly looked at the money in his hand and then at the goat, as if
doubting whether he would not return it. He went to the goat, which was
tied up ready to be led away, and the animal reared up and licked his
hands. His eyes then wavered from side to side; his "mouth was partially
closed, with the corners very decidedly depressed." At last the poor man
seemed to make up his mind that he must part with his goat, and then,
as Mr. Scott saw, the eyebrows became slightly oblique, with the
characteristic puckering or swelling at the inner ends, but the wrinkles
on the forehead were not present. The man stood thus for a minute, then
heaving a deep sigh, burst into tears, raised up his two hands, blessed
the goat, turned round, and without looking again, went away.


_On the cause of the obliquity of the eyebrows under suffering_.--During
several years no expression seemed to me so utterly perplexing as this
which we are here considering. Why should grief or anxiety cause the
central fasciae alone of the frontal muscle together with those round
the eyes, to contract? Here we seem to have a complex movement for the
sole purpose of expressing grief; and yet it is a comparatively rare
expression, and often overlooked. I believe the explanation is not so
difficult as it at first appears. Dr. Duchenne gives a photograph of the
young man before referred to, who, when looking upwards at a strongly
illuminated surface, involuntarily contracted his grief-muscles in an
exaggerated manner. I had entirely forgotten this photograph, when on
a very bright day with the sun behind me, I met, whilst on horseback, a
girl whose eyebrows, as she looked up at me, became extremely oblique,
with the proper furrows on her forehead. I have observed the same
movement under similar circumstances on several subsequent occasions. On
my return home I made three of my children, without giving them any
clue to my object, look as long and as attentively as they could, at the
summit of a tall tree standing against an extremely bright sky. With
all three, the orbicular, corrugator, and pyramidal muscles were
energetically contracted, through reflex action, from the excitement of
the retina, so that their eyes might be protected from the bright light.
But they tried their utmost to look upwards; and now a curious struggle,
with spasmodic twitchings, could be observed between the whole or only
the central portion of the frontal muscle, and the several muscles
which serve to lower the eyebrows and close the eyelids. The involuntary
contraction of the pyramidal caused the basal part of their noses to
be transversely and deeply wrinkled. In one of the three children, the
whole eyebrows were momentarily raised and lowered by the alternate
contraction of the whole frontal muscle and of the muscles surrounding
the eyes, so that the whole breadth of the forehead was alternately
wrinkled and smoothed. In the other two children the forehead became
wrinkled in the middle part alone, rectangular furrows being thus
produced; and the eyebrows were rendered oblique, with their inner
extremities puckered and swollen,--in the one child in a slight degree,
in the other in a strongly marked manner. This difference in the
obliquity of the eyebrows apparently depended on a difference in their
general mobility, and in the strength of the pyramidal muscles. In both
these cases the eyebrows and forehead were acted on under the influence
of a strong light, in precisely the same manner, in every characteristic
detail, as under the influence of grief or anxiety.

Duchenne states that the pyramidal muscle of the nose is less under
the control of the will than are the other muscles round the eyes. He
remarks that the young man who could so well act on his grief-muscles,
as well as on most of his other facial muscles, could not contract the
pyramidals.[705] This power, however, no doubt differs in different
persons. The pyramidal muscle serves to draw down the skin of the
forehead between the eyebrows, together with their inner extremities.
The central fasciae of the frontal are the antagonists of the pyramidal;
and if the action of the latter is to be specially checked, these
central fasciae must be contracted. So that with persons having powerful
pyramidal muscles, if there is under the influence of a bright light an
unconscious desire to prevent the lowering of the eyebrows, the central
fasciae of the frontal muscle must be brought into play; and their
contraction, if sufficiently strong to overmaster the pyramidals,
together with the contraction of the corrugator and orbicular muscles,
will act in the manner just described on the eyebrows and forehead.

When children scream or cry out, they contract, as we know, the
orbicular, corrugator, and pyramidal muscles, primarily for the sake of
compressing their eyes, and thus protecting them from being gorged with
blood, and secondarily through habit. I therefore expected to find with
children, that when they endeavoured either to prevent a crying-fit from
coming on, or to stop crying, they would cheek the contraction of the
above-named muscles, in the same manner as when looking upwards at a
bright light; and consequently that the central fasciae of the frontal
muscle would often be brought into play. Accordingly, I began myself to
observe children at such times, and asked others, including some medical
men, to do the same. It is necessary to observe carefully, as the
peculiar opposed action of these muscles is not nearly so plain in
children, owing to their foreheads not easily wrinkling, as in adults.
But I soon found that the grief-muscles were very frequently brought
into distinct action on these occasions. It would be superfluous to give
all the cases which have been observed; and I will specify only a few.
A little girl, a year and a half old, was teased by some other children,
and before bursting into tears her eyebrows became decidedly oblique.
With an older girl the same obliquity was observed, with the inner ends
of the eyebrows plainly puckered; and at the same time the corners of
the mouth were drawn downwards. As soon as she burst into tears, the
features all changed and this peculiar expression vanished. Again,
after a little boy had been vaccinated, which made him scream and cry
violently, the surgeon gave him an orange brought for the purpose, and
this pleased the child much; as he stopped crying all the characteristic
movements were observed, including the formation of rectangular wrinkles
in the middle of the forehead. Lastly, I met on the road a little girl
three or four years old, who had been frightened by a dog, and when I
asked her what was the matter, she stopped whimpering, and her eyebrows
instantly became oblique to an extraordinary degree.

Here then, as I cannot doubt, we have the key to the problem why the
central fasciae of the frontal muscle and the muscles round the
eyes contract in opposition to each other under the influence of
grief;--whether their contraction be prolonged, as with the melancholic
insane, or momentary, from some trifling cause of distress. We have all
of us, as infants, repeatedly contracted our orbicular, corrugator, and
pyramidal muscles, in order to protect our eyes whilst screaming; our
progenitors before us have done the same during many generations; and
though with advancing years we easily prevent, when feeling distressed,
the utterance of screams, we cannot from long habit always prevent a
slight contraction of the above-named muscles; nor indeed do we observe
their contraction in ourselves, or attempt to stop it, if slight. But
the pyramidal muscles seem to be less under the command of the will
than the other related muscles; and if they be well developed, their
contraction can be checked only by the antagonistic contraction of the
central fasciae of the frontal muscle. The result which necessarily
follows, if these fasciae contract energetically, is the oblique drawing
up of the eyebrows, the puckering of their inner ends, and the formation
of rectangular furrows on the middle of the forehead. As children and
women cry much more freely than men, and as grown-up persons of both
sexes rarely weep except from mental distress, we can understand why the
grief-muscles are more frequently seen in action, as I believe to be
the case, with children and women than with men; and with adults of both
sexes from mental distress alone. In some of the cases before recorded,
as in that of the poor Dhangar woman and of the Hindustani man, the
action of the grief-muscles was quickly followed by bitter weeping. In
all cases of distress, whether great or small, our brains tend through
long habit to send an order to certain muscles to contract, as if we
were still infants on the point of screaming out; but this order we, by
the wondrous power of the will, and through habit, are able partially to
counteract; although this is effected unconsciously, as far as the means
of counteraction are concerned.


_On the depression of the corners of the mouth_.--This action is
effected by the _depressores anguili oris_ (see letter K in figs. 1
and 2). The fibres of this muscle diverge downwards, with the upper
convergent ends attached round the angles of the mouth, and to the lower
lip a little way within the angles.[706] Some of the fibres appear to
be antagonistic to the great zygomatic muscle, and others to the several
muscles running to the outer part of the upper lip. The contraction
of this muscle draws downwards and outwards the corners of the mouth,
including the outer part of the upper lip, and even in a slight degree
the wings of the nostrils. When the mouth is closed and this muscle
acts, the commissure or line of junction of the two lips forms a curved
line with the concavity downwards,[707] and the lips themselves are
generally somewhat protruded, especially the lower one. The mouth in
this state is well represented in the two photographs (Plate II., figs.
6 and 7) by Mr. Rejlander. The upper boy (fig. 6) had just stopped
crying, after receiving a slap on the face from another boy; and the
right moment was seized for photographing him.

The expression of low spirits, grief or dejection, due to the
contraction of this muscle has been noticed by every one who has
written on the subject. To say that a person "is down in the mouth," is
synonymous with saying that he is out of spirits. The depression of the
corners may often be seen, as already stated on the authority of Dr.
Crichton Browne and Mr. Nicol, with the melancholic insane, and was well
exhibited in some photographs sent to me by the former gentleman, of
patients with a strong tendency to suicide. It has been observed
with men belonging to various races, namely with Hindoos, the dark
hill-tribes of India, Malays, and, as the Rev. Mr. Hagenauer informs me,
with the aborigines of Australia.

When infants scream they firmly contract the muscles round their eyes,
and this draws up the upper lip; and as they have to keep their mouths
widely open, the depressor muscles running to the corners are likewise
brought into strong action. This generally, but not invariably, causes a
slight angular bend in the lower lip on both sides, near the corners of
the mouth. The result of the upper and lower lip being thus acted on
is that the mouth assumes a squarish outline. The contraction of the
depressor muscle is best seen in infants when not screaming violently,
and especially just before they begin, or when they cease to scream.
Their little faces then acquire an extremely piteous expression, as I
continually observed with my own infants between the ages of about
six weeks and two or three months. Sometimes, when they are struggling
against a crying-fit, the outline of the mouth is curved in so
exaggerated a manner as to be like a horseshoe; and the expression of
misery then becomes a ludicrous caricature.

The explanation of the contraction of this muscle, under the influence
of low spirits or dejection, apparently follows from the same general
principles as in the case of the obliquity of the eyebrows. Dr. Duchenne
informs me that he concludes from his observations, now prolonged during
many years, that this is one of the facial muscles which is least under
the control of the will. This fact may indeed be inferred from what has
just been stated with respect to infants when doubtfully beginning to
cry, or endeavouring to stop crying; for they then generally command all
the other facial muscles more effectually than they do the depressors of
the corners of the mouth. Two excellent observers who had no theory on
the subject, one of them a surgeon, carefully watched for me some older
children and women as with some opposed struggling they very gradually
approached the point of bursting out into tears; and both observers felt
sure that the depressors began to act before any of the other muscles.
Now as the depressors have been repeatedly brought into strong action
during infancy in many generations, nerve-force will tend to flow, on
the principle of long associated habit, to these muscles as well as
to various other facial muscles, whenever in after life even a slight
feeling of distress is experienced. But as the depressors are somewhat
less under the control of the will than most of the other muscles, we
might expect that they would often slightly contract, whilst the others
remained passive. It is remarkable how small a depression of the corners
of the mouth gives to the countenance an expression of low spirits or
dejection, so that an extremely slight contraction of these muscles
would be sufficient to betray this state of mind.

I may here mention a trifling observation, as it will serve to sum
up our present subject. An old lady with a comfortable but absorbed
expression sat nearly opposite to me in a railway carriage. Whilst I
was looking at her, I saw that her _depressores anguli oris_ became very
slightly, yet decidedly, contracted; but as her countenance remained as
placid as ever, I reflected how meaningless was this contraction, and
how easily one might be deceived. The thought had hardly occurred to me
when I saw that her eyes suddenly became suffused with tears almost to
overflowing, and her whole countenance fell. There could now be no doubt
that some painful recollection, perhaps that of a long-lost child, was
passing through her mind. As soon as her sensorium was thus affected,
certain nerve-cells from long habit instantly transmitted an order to
all the respiratory muscles, and to those round the mouth, to prepare
for a fit of crying. But the order was countermanded by the will, or
rather by a later acquired habit, and all the muscles were obedient,
excepting in a slight degree the _depressores anguli oris_. The mouth
was not even opened; the respiration was not hurried; and no muscle was
affected except those which draw down the corners of the mouth.

As soon as the mouth of this lady began, involuntarily and unconsciously
on her part, to assume the proper form for a crying-fit, we may feel
almost sure that some nerve-influence would have been transmitted
through the long accustomed channels to the various respiratory muscles,
as well as to those round the eyes, and to the vaso-motor centre which
governs the supply of blood sent to the lacrymal glands. Of this
latter fact we have indeed clear evidence in her eyes becoming slightly
suffused with tears; and we can understand this, as the lacrymal glands
are less under the control of the will than the facial muscles. No doubt
there existed at the same time some tendency in the muscles round the
eyes at contract, as if for the sake of protecting them from being
gorged with blood, but this contraction was completely overmastered,
and her brow remained unruffled. Had the pyramidal, corrugator, and
orbicular muscles been as little obedient to the will, as they are
in many persons, they would have been slightly acted on; and then
the central fasciae of the frontal muscle would have contracted in
antagonism, and her eyebrows would have become oblique, with rectangular
furrows on her forehead. Her countenance would then have expressed still
more plainly than it did a state of dejection, or rather one of grief.

Through steps such as these we can understand how it is, that as soon
as some melancholy thought passes through the brain, there occurs a
just perceptible drawing down of the corners of the mouth, or a
slight raising up of the inner ends of the eyebrows, or both movements
combined, and immediately afterwards a slight suffusion of tears. A
thrill of nerve-force is transmitted along several habitual channels,
and produces an effect on any point where the will has not acquired
through long habit much power of interference. The above actions may be
considered as rudimental vestiges of the screaming-fits, which are so
frequent and prolonged during infancy. In this case, as well as in many
others, the links are indeed wonderful which connect cause and effect
in giving rise to various expressions on the human countenance; and they
explain to us the meaning of certain movements, which we involuntarily
and unconsciously perform, whenever certain transitory emotions pass
through our minds.



CHAPTER VIII. -- JOY, HIGH SPIRITS, LOVE, TENDER FEELINGS, DEVOTION.

Laughter primarily the expression of joy--Ludicrous ideas--Movements
of the features during laughter--Nature of the sound produced--The
secretion of tears during loud laughter--Gradation from loud laughter
to gentle smiling--High spirits--The expression of love--Tender
feelings--Devotion.


JOY, when intense, leads to various purposeless movements--to dancing
about, clapping the hands, stamping, &c., and to loud laughter. Laughter
seems primarily to be the expression of mere joy or happiness. We
clearly see this in children at play, who are almost incessantly
laughing. With young persons past childhood, when they are in high
spirits, there is always much meaningless laughter. The laughter of the
gods is described by Homer as "the exuberance of their celestial joy
after their daily banquet." A man smiles--and smiling, as we shall see,
graduates into laughter--at meeting an old friend in the street, as he
does at any trifling pleasure, such as smelling a sweet perfume.[801]
Laura Bridgman, from her blindness and deafness, could not have acquired
any expression through imitation, yet when a letter from a beloved
friend was communicated to her by gesture-language, she "laughed and
clapped her hands, and the colour mounted to her cheeks." On other
occasions she has been seen to stamp for joy.[802]

Idiots and imbecile persons likewise afford good evidence that laughter
or smiling primarily expresses mere happiness or joy. Dr. Crichton
Browne, to whom, as on so many other occasions, I am indebted for the
results of his wide experience, informs me that with idiots laughter is
the most prevalent and frequent of all the emotional expressions. Many
idiots are morose, passionate, restless, in a painful state of mind,
or utterly stolid, and these never laugh. Others frequently laugh in
a quite senseless manner. Thus an idiot boy, incapable of speech,
complained to Dr. Browne, by the aid of signs, that another boy in
the asylum had given him a black eye; and this was accompanied by
"explosions of laughter and with his face covered with the broadest
smiles." There is another large class of idiots who are persistently
joyous and benign, and who are constantly laughing or smiling.[803]
Their countenances often exhibit a stereotyped smile; their joyousness
is increased, and they grin, chuckle, or giggle, whenever food is placed
before them, or when they are caressed, are shown bright colours, or
hear music. Some of them laugh more than usual when they walk about, or
attempt any muscular exertion. The joyousness of most of these idiots
cannot possibly be associated, as Dr. Browne remarks, with any distinct
ideas: they simply feel pleasure, and express it by laughter or smiles.
With imbeciles rather higher in the scale, personal vanity seems to be
the commonest cause of laughter, and next to this, pleasure arising from
the approbation of their conduct.

With grown-up persons laughter is excited by causes considerably
different from those which suffice during childhood; but this remark
hardly applies to smiling. Laughter in this respect is analogous with
weeping, which with adults is almost confined to mental distress, whilst
with children it is excited by bodily pain or any suffering, as well
as by fear or rage. Many curious discussions have been written on the
causes of laughter with grown-up persons. The subject is extremely
complex. Something incongruous or unaccountable, exciting surprise and
some sense of superiority in the laugher, who must be in a happy frame
of mind, seems to be the commonest cause.[804] The circumstances must
not be of a momentous nature: no poor man would laugh or smile on
suddenly hearing that a large fortune had been bequeathed to him. If
the mind is strongly excited by pleasurable feelings, and any little
unexpected event or thought occurs, then, as Mr. Herbert Spencer
remarks,[805] "a large amount of nervous energy, instead of being
allowed to expend itself in producing an equivalent amount of the new
thoughts and emotion which were nascent, is suddenly checked in its
flow."... "The excess must discharge itself in some other direction, and
there results an efflux through the motor nerves to various classes of
the muscles, producing the half-convulsive actions we term laughter." An
observation, bearing on this point, was made by a correspondent during
the recent siege of Paris, namely, that the German soldiers, after
strong excitement from exposure to extreme danger, were particularly
apt to burst out into loud laughter at the smallest joke. So again
when young children are just beginning to cry, an unexpected event will
sometimes suddenly turn their crying into laughter, which apparently
serves equally well to expend their superfluous nervous energy.

The imagination is sometimes said to be tickled by a ludicrous idea; and
this so-called tickling of the mind is curiously analogous with that of
the body. Every one knows how immoderately children laugh, and how their
whole bodies are convulsed when they are tickled. The anthropoid apes,
as we have seen, likewise utter a reiterated sound, corresponding with
our laughter, when they are tickled, especially under the armpits. I
touched with a bit of paper the sole of the foot of one of my infants,
when only seven days old, and it was suddenly jerked away and the toes
curled about, as in an older child. Such movements, as well as laughter
from being tickled, are manifestly reflex actions; and this is likewise
shown by the minute unstriped muscles, which serve to erect the separate
hairs on the body, contracting near a tickled surface.[806] Yet laughter
from a ludicrous idea, though involuntary, cannot be called a strictly
reflex action. In this case, and in that of laughter from being tickled,
the mind must be in a pleasurable condition; a young child, if tickled
by a strange man, would scream from fear. The touch must be light, and
an idea or event, to be ludicrous, must not be of grave import. The
parts of the body which are most easily tickled are those which are not
commonly touched, such as the armpits or between the toes, or parts
such as the soles of the feet, which are habitually touched by a broad
surface; but the surface on which we sit offers a marked exception to
this rule. According to Gratiolet,[807] certain nerves are much more
sensitive to tickling than others. From the fact that a child can hardly
tickle itself, or in a much less degree than when tickled by another
person, it seems that the precise point to be touched must not be known;
so with the mind, something unexpected--a novel or incongruous idea
which breaks through an habitual train of thought--appears to be a
strong element in the ludicrous.

The sound of laughter is produced by a deep inspiration followed by
short, interrupted, spasmodic contractions of the chest, and especially
of the diaphragm.[808] Hence we hear of "laughter holding both his
sides." From the shaking of the body, the head nods to and fro. The
lower jaw often quivers up and down, as is likewise the case with some
species of baboons, when they are much pleased.

[Illustration: Moderate laughter and smiling. Plate III]

During laughter the mouth is opened more or less widely, with the
corners drawn much backwards, as well as a little upwards; and the upper
lip is somewhat raised. The drawing back of the corners is best seen in
moderate laughter, and especially in a broad smile--the latter epithet
showing how the mouth is widened. In the accompanying figs. 1-3, Plate
III., different degrees of moderate laughter and smiling have been
photographed. The figure of the little girl, with the hat is by Dr.
Wallich, and the expression was a genuine one; the other two are by Mr.
Rejlander. Dr. Duchenne repeatedly insists[809] that, under the emotion
of joy, the mouth is acted on exclusively by the great zygomatic
muscles, which serve to draw the corners backwards and upwards; but
judging from the manner in which the upper teeth are always exposed
during laughter and broad smiling, as well as from my own sensations,
I cannot doubt that some of the muscles running to the upper lip are
likewise brought into moderate action. The upper and lower orbicular
muscles of the eyes are at the same time more or less contracted; and
there is an intimate connection, as explained in the chapter on weeping,
between the orbiculars, especially the lower ones and some of the
muscles running to the upper lip. Henle remarks[810] on this head, that
when a man closely shuts one eye he cannot avoid retracting the upper
lip on the same side; conversely, if any one will place his finger
on his lower eyelid, and then uncover his upper incisors as much as
possible, he will feel, as his upper lip is drawn strongly upwards, that
the muscles of the lower eyelid contract. In Henle's drawing, given in
woodcut, fig. 2, the _musculus malaris_ (H) which runs to the upper
lip may be seen to form an almost integral part of the lower orbicular
muscle.

Dr. Duchenne has given a large photograph of an old man (reduced on
Plate III. fig 4), in his usual passive condition, and another of
the same man (fig. 5), naturally smiling. The latter was instantly
recognized by every one to whom it was shown as true to nature. He
has also given, as an example of an unnatural or false smile, another
photograph (fig. 6) of the same old man, with the corners of his mouth
strongly retracted by the galvanization of the great zygomatic
muscles. That the expression is not natural is clear, for I showed this
photograph to twenty-four persons, of whom three could not in the least
tell what was meant, whilst the others, though they perceived that the
expression was of the nature of a smile, answered in such words as "a
wicked joke," "trying to laugh," "grinning laughter.... half-amazed
laughter," &c. Dr. Duchenne attributes the falseness of the expression
altogether to the orbicular muscles of the lower eyelids not being
sufficiently contracted; for he justly lays great stress on their
contraction in the expression of joy. No doubt there is much truth
in this view, but not, as it appears to me, the whole truth. The
contraction of the lower orbiculars is always accompanied, as we have
seen, by the drawing up of the upper lip. Had the upper lip, in fig.
6, been thus acted on to a slight extent, its curvature would have been
less rigid, the naso-labial farrow would have been slightly different,
and the whole expression would, as I believe, have been more natural,
independently of the more conspicuous effect from the stronger
contraction of the lower eyelids. The corruptor muscle, moreover, in
fig. 6, is too much contracted, causing a frown; and this muscle never
acts under the influence of joy except during strongly pronounced or
violent laughter.

By the drawing backwards and upwards of the corners of the mouth,
through the contraction of the great zygomatic muscles, and by the
raising of the upper lip, the cheeks are drawn upwards. Wrinkles are
thus formed under the eyes, and, with old people, at their outer ends;
and these are highly characteristic of laughter or smiling. As a gentle
smile increases into a strong one, or into a laugh, every one may feel
and see, if he will attend to his own sensations and look at himself
in a mirror, that as the upper lip is drawn up and the lower orbiculars
contract, the wrinkles in the lower eyelids and those beneath the
eyes are much strengthened or increased. At the same time, as I have
repeatedly observed, the eyebrows are slightly lowered, which shows
that the upper as well as the lower orbiculars contract at least to some
degree, though this passes unperecived, as far as our sensations
are concerned. If the original photograph of the old man, with his
countenance in its usual placid state (fig. 4), be compared with that
(fig. 5) in which he is naturally smiling, it may be seen that the
eyebrows in the latter are a little lowered. I presume that this is
owing to the upper orbiculars being impelled, through the force of
long-associated habit, to act to a certain extent in concert with the
lower orbiculars, which themselves contract in connection with the
drawing up of the upper lip.

The tendency in the zygomatic muscles to contract under pleasurable
emotions is shown by a curious fact, communicated to me by Dr. Browne,
with respect to patients suffering from GENERAL PARALYSIS OF
THE INSANE.[811] "In this malady there is almost invariably
optimism--delusions as to wealth, rank, grandeur--insane joyousness,
benevolence, and profusion, while its very earliest physical symptom is
trembling at the corners of the mouth and at the outer corners of the
eyes. This is a well-recognized fact. Constant tremulous agitation of
the inferior palpebral and great zygomatic muscles is pathognomic of the
earlier stages of general paralysis. The countenance has a pleased and
benevolent expression. As the disease advances other muscles become
involved, but until complete fatuity is reached, the prevailing
expression is that of feeble benevolence."

As in laughing and broadly smiling the cheeks and upper lip are much
raised, the nose appears to be shortened, and the skin on the bridge
becomes finely wrinkled in transverse lines, with other oblique
longitudinal lines on the sides. The upper front teeth are commonly
exposed. A well-marked naso-labial fold is formed, which runs from the
wing of each nostril to the corner of the mouth; and this fold is often
double in old persons.

A bright and sparkling eye is as characteristic of a pleased or amused
state of mind, as is the retraction of the corners of the mouth
and upper lip with the wrinkles thus produced. Even the eyes of
microcephalous idiots, who are so degraded that they never learn to
speak, brighten slightly when they are pleased.[812] Under extreme
laughter the eyes are too much suffused with tears to sparkle; but the
moisture squeezed out of the glands during moderate laughter or smiling
may aid in giving them lustre; though this must be of altogether
subordinate importance, as they become dull from grief, though they
are then often moist. Their brightness seems to be chiefly due to their
tenseness,[813] owing to the contraction of the orbicular muscles and
to the pressure of the raised cheeks. But, according to Dr. Piderit,
who has discussed this point more fully than any other writer,[814] the
tenseness may be largely attributed to the eyeballs becoming filled
with blood and other fluids, from the acceleration of the circulation,
consequent on the excitement of pleasure. He remarks on the contrast in
the appearance of the eyes of a hectic patient with a rapid circulation,
and of a man suffering from cholera with almost all the fluids of his
body drained from him. Any cause which lowers the circulation deadens
the eye. I remember seeing a man utterly prostrated by prolonged and
severe exertion during a very hot day, and a bystander compared his eyes
to those of a boiled codfish.

To return to the sounds produced during laughter. We can see in a vague
manner how the utterance of sounds of some kind would naturally become
associated with a pleasurable state of mind; for throughout a large part
of the animal kingdom vocal or instrumental sounds are employed either
as a call or as a charm by one sex for the other. They are also
employed as the means for a joyful meeting between the parents and
their offspring, and between the attached members of the same social
community. But why the sounds which man utters when he is pleased
have the peculiar reiterated character of laughter we do not know.
Nevertheless we can see that they would naturally be as different as
possible from the screams or cries of distress; and as in the production
of the latter, the expirations are prolonged and continuous, with
the inspirations short and interrupted, so it might perhaps have been
expected with the sounds uttered from joy, that the expirations would
have been short and broken with the inspirations prolonged; and this is
the case.

It is an equally obscure point why the corners of the mouth are
retracted and the upper lip raised during ordinary laughter. The mouth
must not be opened to its utmost extent, for when this occurs during
a paroxysm of excessive laughter hardly any sound is emitted; or it
changes its tone and seems to come from deep down in the throat. The
respiratory muscles, and even those of the limbs, are at the same time
thrown into rapid vibratory movements. The lower jaw often partakes
of this movement, and this would tend to prevent the mouth from being
widely opened. But as a full volume of sound has to be poured forth, the
orifice of the mouth must be large; and it is perhaps to gain this end
that the corners are retracted and the upper lip raised. Although we can
hardly account for the shape of the mouth during laughter, which
leads to wrinkles being formed beneath the eyes, nor for the peculiar
reiterated sound of laughter, nor for the quivering of the jaws,
nevertheless we may infer that all these effects are due to some common
cause. For they are all characteristic and expressive of a pleased state
of mind in various kinds of monkeys.

A graduated series can be followed from violent to moderate laughter,
to a broad smile, to a gentle smile, and to the expression of mere
cheerfulness. During excessive laughter the whole body is often thrown
backward and shakes, or is almost convulsed; the respiration is much
disturbed; the head and face become gorged with blood, with the veins
distended; and the orbicular muscles are spasmodically contracted in
order to protect the eyes. Tears are freely shed. Hence, as formerly
remarked, it is scarcely possible to point out any difference between
the tear-stained face of a person after a paroxysm of excessive laughter
and after a bitter crying-fit.[815] It is probably due to the close
similarity of the spasmodic movements caused by these widely different
emotions that hysteric patients alternately cry and laugh with violence,
and that young children sometimes pass suddenly from the one to the
other state. Mr. Swinhoe informs me that he has often seen the Chinese,
when suffering from deep grief, burst out into hysterical fits of
laughter.

I was anxious to know whether tears are freely shed during excessive
laughter by most of the races of men, and I hear from my correspondents
that this is the case. One instance was observed with the Hindoos, and
they themselves said that it often occurred. So it is with the Chinese.
The women of a wild tribe of Malays in the Malacca peninsula, sometimes
shed tears when they laugh heartily, though this seldom occurs. With the
Dyaks of Borneo it must frequently be the case, at least with the women,
for I hear from the Rajah C. Brooke that it is a common expression with
them to say "we nearly made tears from laughter." The aborigines of
Australia express their emotions freely, and they are described by my
correspondents as jumping about and clapping their hands for joy, and as
often roaring with laughter. No less than four observers have seen their
eyes freely watering on such occasions; and in one instance the tears
rolled down their cheeks. Mr. Bulmer, a missionary in a remote part of
Victoria, remarks, "that they have a keen sense of the ridiculous;
they are excellent mimics, and when one of them is able to imitate the
peculiarities of some absent member of the tribe, it is very common to
hear all in the camp convulsed with laughter." With Europeans hardly
anything excites laughter so easily as mimicry; and it is rather curious
to find the same fact with the savages of Australia, who constitute one
of the most distinct races in the world.

In Southern Africa with two tribes of Kafirs, especially with the women,
their eyes often fill with tears during laughter. Gaika, the brother of
the chief Sandilli, answers my query on this bead, with the words, "Yes,
that is their common practice." Sir Andrew Smith has seen the painted
face of a Hottentot woman all furrowed with tears after a fit of
laughter. In Northern Africa, with the Abyssinians, tears are secreted
under the same circumstances. Lastly, in North America, the same fact
has been observed in a remarkably savage and isolated tribe, but chiefly
with the women; in another tribe it was observed only on a single
occasion.

Excessive laughter, as before remarked, graduates into moderate
laughter. In this latter case the muscles round the eyes are much less
contracted, and there is little or no frowning. Between a gentle laugh
and a broad smile there is hardly any difference, excepting that in
smiling no reiterated sound is uttered, though a single rather strong
expiration, or slight noise--a rudiment of a laugh--may often be heard
at the commencement of a smile. On a moderately smiling countenance the
contraction of the upper orbicular muscles can still just be traced by a
slight lowering of the eyebrows. The contraction of the lower orbicular
and palpebral muscles is much plainer, and is shown by the wrinkling of
the lower eyelids and of the skin beneath them, together with a slight
drawing up of the upper lip. From the broadest smile we pass by the
finest steps into the gentlest one. In this latter case the features are
moved in a much less degree, and much more slowly, and the mouth is
kept closed. The curvature of the naso-labial furrow is also slightly
different in the two cases. We thus see that no abrupt line of
demarcation can be drawn between the movement of the features during the
most violent laughter and a very faint smile.[816]

A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development
of a laugh. But a different and more probable view may be suggested;
namely, that the habit of uttering load reiterated sounds from a sense
of pleasure, first led to the retraction of the corners of the mouth and
of the upper lip, and to the contraction of the orbicular muscles; and
that now, through association and long-continued habit, the same muscles
are brought into slight play whenever any cause excites in us a feeling
which, if stronger, would have led to laughter; and the result is a
smile.

Whether we look at laughter as the full development of a smile, or, as
is more probable, at a gentle smile as the last trace of a habit, firmly
fixed during many generations, of laughing whenever we are joyful, we
can follow in our infants the gradual passage of the one into the other.
It is well known to those who have the charge of young infants, that it
is difficult to feel sure when certain movements about their mouths are
really expressive; that is, when they really smile. Hence I carefully
watched my own infants. One of them at the age of forty-five days, and
being at the time in a happy frame of mind, smiled; that is, the
corners of the mouth were retracted, and simultaneously the eyes became
decidedly bright. I observed the same thing on the following day; but on
the third day the child was not quite well and there was no trace of a
smile, and this renders it probable that the previous smiles were real.
Eight days subsequently and during the next succeeding week, it was
remarkable how his eyes brightened whenever he smiled, and his nose
became at the same time transversely wrinkled. This was now accompanied
by a little bleating noise, which perhaps represented a laugh. At the
age of 113 days these little noises, which were always made during
expiration, assumed a slightly different character, and were more
broken or interrupted, as in sobbing; and this was certainly incipient
laughter. The change in tone seemed to me at the time to be connected
with the greater lateral extension of the mouth as the smiles became
broader.

In a second infant the first real smile was observed at about the same
age, viz. forty-five days; and in a third, at a somewhat earlier age.
The second infant, when sixty-five days old, smiled much more broadly
and plainly than did the one first mentioned at the same age; and even
at this early age uttered noises very like laughter. In this gradual
acquirement, by infants, of the habit of laughing, we have a case in
some degree analogous to that of weeping. As practice is requisite with
the ordinary movements of the body, such as walking, so it seems to be
with laughing and weeping. The art of screaming, on the other hand,
from being of service to infants, has become finely developed from the
earliest days.


_High spirits, cheerfulness_.--A man in high spirits, though he may not
actually smile, commonly exhibits some tendency to the retraction of the
corners of his mouth. From the excitement of pleasure, the circulation
becomes more rapid; the eyes are bright, and the colour of the face
rises. The brain, being stimulated by the increased flow of blood,
reacts on the mental powers; lively ideas pass still more rapidly
through the mind, and the affections are warmed. I heard a child, a
little under four years old, when asked what was meant by being in good
spirits, answer, "It is laughing, talking, and kissing." It would be
difficult to give a truer and more practical definition. A man in this
state holds his body erect, his head upright, and his eyes open. There
is no drooping of the features, and no contraction of the eyebrows.
On the contrary, the frontal muscle, as Moreau observes,[817] tends to
contract slightly; and this smooths the brow, removes every trace of a
frown, arches the eyebrows a little, and raises the eyelids. Hence the
Latin phrase, _exporrigere frontem_--to unwrinkle the brow--means, to
be cheerful or merry. The whole expression of a man in good spirits is
exactly the opposite of that of one suffering from sorrow. According to
Sir C. Bell, "In all the exhilarating emotions the eyebrows, eyelids,
the nostrils, and the angles of the mouth are raised. In the depressing
passions it is the reverse." Under the influence of the latter the brow
is heavy, the eyelids, cheeks, mouth, and whole head droop; the eyes are
dull; the countenance pallid, and the respiration slow. In joy the face
expands, in grief it lengthens. Whether the principle of antithesis has
here come into play in producing these opposite expressions, in aid of
the direct causes which have been specified and which are sufficiently
plain, I will not pretend to say.

With all the races of man the expression of good spirit appears to be
the same, and is easily recognized. My informants, from various parts of
the Old and New Worlds, answer in the affirmative to my queries on this
head, and they give some particulars with respect to Hindoos, Malays,
and New Zealanders. The brightness of the eyes of the Australians has
struck four observers, and the same fact has been noticed with Hindoos,
New Zealanders, and the Dyaks of Borneo.

Savages sometimes express their satisfaction not only by smiling, but
by gestures derived from the pleasure of eating. Thus Mr. Wedgwood[818]
quotes Petherick that the negroes on the Upper Nile began a general
rubbing of their bellies when he displayed his beads; and Leichhardt
says that the Australians smacked and clacked their mouths at the sight
of his horses and bullocks, and more especially of his kangaroo dogs.
The Greenlanders, "when they affirm anything with pleasure, suck down
air with a certain sound;"[819] and this may be an imitation of the act
of swallowing savoury food.

Laughter is suppressed by the firm contraction of the orbicular muscles
of the mouth, which prevents the great zygomatic and other muscles from
drawing the lips backwards and upwards. The lower lip is also sometimes
held by the teeth, and this gives a roguish expression to the face,
as was observed with the blind and deaf Laura Bridgman.[820] The great
zygomatic muscle is sometimes variable in its course, and I have seen
a young woman in whom the _depressores anguli oris_ were brought into
strong action in suppressing a smile; but this by no means gave to her
countenance a melancholy expression, owing to the brightness of her
eyes.

Laughter is frequently employed in a forced manner to conceal or mask
some other state of mind, even anger. We often see persons laughing in
order to conceal their shame or shyness. When a person purses up his
mouth, as if to prevent the possibility of a smile, though there is
nothing to excite one, or nothing to prevent its free indulgence, an
affected, solemn, or pedantic expression is given; but of such hybrid
expressions nothing more need here be said. In the case of derision, a
real or pretended smile or laugh is often blended with the expression
proper to contempt, and this may pass into angry contempt or scorn. In
such cases the meaning of the laugh or smile is to show the offending
person that he excites only amusement.

_Love, tender feelings, &c_.--Although the emotion of love, for instance
that of a mother for her infant, is one of the strongest of which the
mind is capable, it can hardly be said to have any proper or peculiar
means of expression; and this is intelligible, as it has not habitually
led to any special line of action. No doubt, as affection is a
pleasurable sensation, it generally causes a gentle smile and some
brightening of the eyes. A strong desire to touch the beloved person is
commonly felt; and love is expressed by this means more plainly than
by any other.[821] Hence we long to clasp in our arms those whom we
tenderly love. We probably owe this desire to inherited habit, in
association with the nursing and tending of our children, and with the
mutual caresses of lovers.

With the lower animals we see the same principle of pleasure derived
from contact in association with love. Dogs and cats manifestly take
pleasure in rubbing against their masters and mistresses, and in being
rubbed or patted by them. Many kinds of monkeys, as I am assured by the
keepers in the Zoological Gardens, delight in fondling and being fondled
by each other, and by persons to whom they are attached. Mr. Bartlett
has described to me the behaviour of two chimpanzees, rather older
animals than those generally imported into this country, when they were
first brought together. They sat opposite, touching each other with
their much protruded lips; and the one put his hand on the shoulder
of the other. They then mutually folded each other in their arms.
Afterwards they stood up, each with one arm on the shoulder of the
other, lifted up their heads, opened their mouths, and yelled with
delight.

We Europeans are so accustomed to kissing as a mark of affection, that
it might be thought to be innate in mankind; but this is not the case.
Steele was mistaken when he said "Nature was its author, and it began
with the first courtship." Jemmy Button, the Fuegian, told me that this
practice was unknown in his land. It is equally unknown with the New
Zealanders, Tahitians, Papuans, Australians, Somals of Africa, and
the Esquimaux. But it is so far innate or natural that it apparently
depends on pleasure from close contact with a beloved person; and it is
replaced in various parts of the world, by the rubbing of noses, as
with the New Zealanders and Laplanders, by the rubbing or patting of the
arms, breasts, or stomachs, or by one man striking his own face with the
hands or feet of another. Perhaps the practice of blowing, as a mark
of affection, on various parts of the body may depend on the same
principle.[823]

The feelings which are called tender are difficult to analyse; they seem
to be compounded of affection, joy, and especially of sympathy. These
feelings are in themselves of a pleasurable nature, excepting when pity
is too deep, or horror is aroused, as in hearing of a tortured man or
animal. They are remarkable under our present point of view from so
readily exciting the secretion of tears. Many a father and son have wept
on meeting after a long separation, especially if the meeting has been
unexpected. No doubt extreme joy by itself tends to act on the lacrymal
glands; but on such occasions as the foregoing vague thoughts of the
grief which would have been felt had the father and son never met, will
probably have passed through their minds; and grief naturally leads to
the secretion of tears. Thus on the return of Ulysses:--

    "Telemachus Rose, and clung weeping round his father's breast.
     There the pent grief rained o'er them, yearning thus.
     *   *    *    *    *    *
     Thus piteously they wailed in sore unrest,
     And on their weepings had gone down the day,
     But that at last Telemachus found words to say."
    _Worsley's Translation of the Odyssey_, Book xvi. st. 27.

So again when Penelope at last recognized her husband:--

     "Then from her eyelids the quick tears did start
     And she ran to him from her place, and threw
     Her arms about his neck, and a warm dew
     Of kisses poured upon him, and thus spake:"
     --Book xxiii.  st.  27.


The vivid recollection of our former home, or of long-past happy days,
readily causes the eyes to be suffused with tears; but here, again,
the thought naturally occurs that these days will never return. In such
cases we may be said to sympathize with ourselves in our present, in
comparison with our former, state. Sympathy with the distresses of
others, even with the imaginary distresses of a heroine in a pathetic
story, for whom we feel no affection, readily excites tears. So does
sympathy with the happiness of others, as with that of a lover, at last
successful after many hard trials in a well-told tale.

Sympathy appears to constitute a separate or distinct emotion; and it is
especially apt to excite the lacrymal glands. This holds good whether
we give or receive sympathy. Every one must have noticed how readily
children burst out crying if we pity them for some small hurt. With the
melancholic insane, as Dr. Crichton Browne informs me, a kind word will
often plunge them into unrestrained weeping. As soon as we express our
pity for the grief of a friend, tears often come into our own eyes. The
feeling of sympathy is commonly explained by assuming that, when we see
or hear of suffering in another, the idea of suffering is called up so
vividly in our own minds that we ourselves suffer. But this explanation
is hardly sufficient, for it does not account for the intimate alliance
between sympathy and affection. We undoubtedly sympathize far more
deeply with a beloved than with an indifferent person; and the sympathy
of the one gives us far more relief than that of the other. Yet
assuredly we can sympathize with those for whom we feel no affection.

Why suffering, when actually experienced by ourselves, excites weeping,
has been discussed in a former chapter. With respect to joy, its natural
and universal expression is laughter; and with all the races of man loud
laughter leads to the secretion of tears more freely than does any other
cause excepting distress. The suffusion of the eyes with tears, which
undoubtedly occurs under great joy, though there is no laughter, can, as
it seems to me, be explained through habit and association on the same
principles as the effusion of tears from grief, although there is no
screaming. Nevertheless it is not a little remarkable that sympathy with
the distresses of others should excite tears more freely than our own
distress; and this certainly is the case. Many a man, from whose eyes
no suffering of his own could wring a tear, has shed tears at the
sufferings of a beloved friend. It is still more remarkable that
sympathy with the happiness or good fortune of those whom we tenderly
love should lead to the same result, whilst a similar happiness felt
by ourselves would leave our eyes dry. We should, however, bear in
mind that the long-continued habit of restraint which is so powerful in
checking the free flow of tears from bodily pain, has not been brought
into play in preventing a moderate effusion of tears in sympathy with
the sufferings or happiness of others.

Music has a wonderful power, as I have elsewhere attempted to show,[824]
of recalling in a vague and indefinite manner, those strong emotions
which were felt during long-past ages, when, as is probable, our early
progenitors courted each other by the aid of vocal tones. And as several
of our strongest emotions--grief, great joy, love, and sympathy--lead to
the free secretion of tears, it is not surprising that music should be
apt to cause our eyes to become suffused with tears, especially when
we are already softened by any of the tenderer feelings. Music often
produces another peculiar effect. We know that every strong sensation,
emotion, or excitement--extreme pain, rage, terror, joy, or the passion
of love--all have a special tendency to cause the muscles to tremble;
and the thrill or slight shiver which runs down the backbone and limbs
of many persons when they are powerfully affected by music, seems to
bear the same relation to the above trembling of the body, as a slight
suffusion of tears from the power of music does to weeping from any
strong and real emotion.

_Devotion_.--As devotion is, in some degree, related to affection,
though mainly consisting of reverence, often combined with fear, the
expression of this state of mind may here be briefly noticed. With some
sects, both past and present, religion and love have been strangely
combined; and it has even been maintained, lamentable as the fact may
be, that the holy kiss of love differs but little from that which a
man bestows on a woman, or a woman on a man.[825] Devotion is chiefly
expressed by the face being directed towards the heavens, with the
eyeballs upturned. Sir C. Bell remarks that, at the approach of sleep,
or of a fainting-fit, or of death, the pupils are drawn upwards and
inwards; and he believes that "when we are wrapt in devotional feelings,
and outward impressions are unheeded, the eyes are raised by an action
neither taught nor acquired." and that this is due to the same cause as
in the above cases.[826] That the eyes are upturned during sleep is,
as I hear from Professor Donders, certain. With babies, whilst sucking
their mother's breast, this movement of the eyeballs often gives to them
an absurd appearance of ecstatic delight; and here it may be clearly
perceived that a struggle is going on against the position naturally
assumed during sleep. But Sir C. Bell's explanation of the fact, which
rests on the assumption that certain muscles are more under the control
of the will than others is, as I hear from Professor Donders, incorrect.
As the eyes are often turned up in prayer, without the mind being so
much absorbed in thought as to approach to the unconsciousness of sleep,
the movement is probably a conventional one--the result of the common
belief that Heaven, the source of Divine power to which we pray, is
seated above us.

A humble kneeling posture, with the hands upturned and palms joined,
appears to us, from long habit, a gesture so appropriate to devotion,
that it might be thought to be innate; but I have not met with any
evidence to this effect with the various extra-European races of
mankind. During the classical period of Roman history it does not
appear, as I hear from an excellent classic, that the hands were thus
joined during prayer. Mr. Rensleigh Wedgwood has apparently given[827]
the true explanation, though this implies that the attitude is one of
slavish subjection. "When the suppliant kneels and holds up his
hands with the palms joined, he represents a captive who proves the
completeness of his submission by offering up his hands to be bound
by the victor. It is the pictorial representation of the Latin _dare
manus_, to signify submission." Hence it is not probable that either
the uplifting of the eyes or the joining of the open hands, under
the influence of devotional feelings, are innate or truly expressive
actions; and this could hardly have been expected, for it is very
doubtful whether feelings, such as we should now rank as devotional,
affected the hearts of men, whilst they remained during past ages in an
uncivilized condition.



CHAPTER IX. -- REFLECTION--MEDITATION-ILL-TEMPER--SULKINESS--DETERMINATION.

The act of frowning--Reflection with an effort, or with the
perception of something difficult or disagreeable--Abstracted
meditation--Ill-temper--Moroseness--Obstinacy Sulkiness and
pouting--Decision or determination--The firm closure of the mouth.


THE corrugators, by their contraction, lower the eyebrows and bring them
together, producing vertical furrows on the forehead--that is, a frown.
Sir C. Bell, who erroneously thought that the corrugator was peculiar to
man, ranks it as "the most remarkable muscle of the human face. It
knits the eyebrows with an energetic effort, which unaccountably, but
irresistibly, conveys the idea of mind." Or, as he elsewhere says, "when
the eyebrows are knit, energy of mind is apparent, and there is the
mingling of thought and emotion with the savage and brutal rage of the
mere animal."[901] There is much truth in these remarks, but hardly
the whole truth. Dr. Duchenne has called the corrugator the muscle
of reflection;[902] but this name, without some limitation, cannot be
considered as quite correct.

A man may be absorbed in the deepest thought, and his brow will remain
smooth until he encounters some obstacle in his train of reasoning,
or is interrupted by some disturbance, and then a frown passes like
a shadow over his brow. A half-starved man may think intently how to
obtain food, but he probably will not frown unless he encounters either
in thought or action some difficulty, or finds the food when obtained
nauseous. I have noticed that almost everyone instantly frowns if he
perceives a strange or bad taste in what he is eating. I asked several
persons, without explaining my object, to listen intently to a very
gentle tapping sound, the nature and source of which they all perfectly
knew, and not one frowned; but a man who joined us, and who could not
conceive what we were all doing in profound silence, when asked to
listen, frowned much, though not in an ill-temper, and said he could
not in the least understand what we all wanted. Dr. Piderit[903] who
has published remarks to the same effect, adds that stammerers generally
frown in speaking, and that a man in doing even so trifling a thing as
pulling on a boot, frowns if he finds it too tight. Some persons are
such habitual frowners, that the mere effort of speaking almost always
causes their brows to contract.

Men of all races frown when they are in any way perplexed in thought,
as I infer from the answers which I have received to my queries; but
I framed them badly, confounding absorbed meditation with perplexed
reflection. Nevertheless, it is clear that the Australians, Malays,
Hindoos, and Kafirs of South Africa frown, when they are puzzled.
Dobritzhoffer remarks that the Guaranies of South America on like
occasions knit their brows.[904]

From these considerations, we may conclude that frowning is not the
expression of simple reflection, however profound, or of attention,
however close, but of something difficult or displeasing encountered in
a train of thought or in action. Deep reflection can, however, seldom
be long carried on without some difficulty, so that it will generally be
accompanied by a frown. Hence it is that frowning commonly gives to the
countenance, as Sir C. Bell remarks, an aspect of intellectual energy.
But in order that this effect may be produced, the eyes must be clear
and steady, or they may be cast downwards, as often occurs in deep
thought. The countenance must not be otherwise disturbed, as in the case
of an ill-tempered or peevish man, or of one who shows the effects of
prolonged suffering, with dulled eyes and drooping jaw, or who perceives
a bad taste in his food, or who finds it difficult to perform some
trifling act, such as threading a needle. In these cases a frown may
often be seen, but it will be accompanied by some other expression,
which will entirely prevent the countenance having an appearance of
intellectual energy or of profound thought.

We may now inquire how it is that a frown should express the perception
of something difficult or disagreeable, either in thought or action. In
the same way as naturalists find it advisable to trace the embryological
development of an organ in order fully to understand its structure, so
with the movements of expression it is advisable to follow as nearly
as possible the same plan. The earliest and almost sole expression
seen during the first days of infancy, and then often exhibited is that
displayed during the act of screaming; and screaming is excited, both at
first and for some time afterwards, by every distressing or displeasing
sensation and emotion,--by hunger, pain, anger, jealousy, fear, &c. At
such times the muscles round the eyes are strongly contracted; and this,
as I believe, explains to a large extent the act of frowning during the
remainder of our lives. I repeatedly observed my own infants, from under
the age of one week to that of two or three months, and found that when
a screaming-fit came on gradually, the first sign was the contraction of
the corrugators, which produced a slight frown, quickly followed by
the contraction of the other muscles round the eyes. When an infant is
uncomfortable or unwell, little frowns--as I record in my notes--may
be seen incessantly passing like shadows over its face; these being
generally, but not always, followed sooner or later by a crying-fit. For
instance, I watched for some time a baby, between seven and eight weeks
old, sucking some milk which was cold, and therefore displeasing to him;
and a steady little frown was maintained all the time. This was never
developed into an actual crying-fit, though occasionally every stage of
close approach could be observed.

As the habit of contracting the brows has been followed by infants
during innumerable generations, at the commencement of every crying or
screaming fit, it has become firmly associated with the incipient
sense of something distressing or disagreeable. Hence under similar
circumstances it would be apt to be continued during maturity, although
never then developed into a crying-fit. Screaming or weeping begins to
be voluntarily restrained at an early period of life, whereas frowning
is hardly ever restrained at any age. It is perhaps worth notice that
with children much given to weeping, anything which perplexes their
minds, and which would cause most other children merely to frown,
readily makes them weep. So with certain classes of the insane, any
effort of mind, however slight, which with an habitual frowner would
cause a slight frown, leads to their weeping in an unrestrained manner.
It is not more surprising that the habit of contracting the brows at
the first perception of something distressing, although gained during
infancy, should be retained during the rest of our lives, than that many
other associated habits acquired at an early age should be permanently
retained both by man and the lower animals. For instance, full-grown
cats, when feeling warm and comfortable, often retain the habit of
alternately protruding their fore-feet with extended toes, which habit
they practised for a definite purpose whilst sucking their mothers.

Another and distinct cause has probably strengthened the habit of
frowning, whenever the mind is intent on any subject and encounters some
difficulty. Vision is the most important of all the senses, and during
primeval times the closest attention must have been incessantly:
directed towards distant objects for the sake of obtaining prey and
avoiding danger. I remember being struck, whilst travelling in parts of
South America, which were dangerous from the presence of Indians, how
incessantly, yet as it appeared unconsciously, the half-wild Gauchos
closely scanned the whole horizon. Now, when any one with no covering on
his head (as must have been aboriginally the case with mankind), strives
to the utmost to distinguish in broad daylight, and especially if the
sky is bright, a distant object, he almost invariably contracts his
brows to prevent the entrance of too much light; the lower eyelids,
cheeks, and upper lip being at the same time raised, so as to lessen the
orifice of the eyes. I have purposely asked several persons, young and
old, to look, under the above circumstances, at distant objects, making
them believe that I only wished to test the power of their vision; and
they all behaved in the manner just described. Some of them, also, put
their open, flat hands over their eyes to keep out the excess of light.
Gratiolet, after making some remarks to nearly the same effect,[905]
says, "Ce sont la des attitudes de vision difficile." He concludes that
the muscles round the eyes contract partly for the sake of excluding too
much light (which appears to me the more important end), and partly to
prevent all rays striking the retina, except those which come direct
from the object that is scrutinized. Mr. Bowman, whom I consulted on
this point, thinks that the contraction of the surrounding muscles may,
in addition, "partly sustain the consensual movements of the two eyes,
by giving a firmer support while the globes are brought to binocular
vision by their own proper muscles."

As the effort of viewing with care under a bright light a distant object
is both difficult and irksome, and as this effort has been habitually
accompanied, during numberless generations, by the contraction of the
eyebrows, the habit of frowning will thus have been much strengthened;
although it was originally practised during infancy from a quite
independent cause, namely as the first step in the protection of the
eyes during screaming. There is, indeed, much analogy, as far as the
state of the mind is concerned, between intently scrutinizing a distant
object, and following out an obscure train of thought, or performing
some little and troublesome mechanical work. The belief that the habit
of contracting the brows is continued when there is no need whatever to
exclude too much light, receives support from the cases formerly
alluded to, in which the eyebrows or eyelids are acted on under certain
circumstances in a useless manner, from having been similarly used,
under analogous circumstances, for a serviceable purpose. For instance,
we voluntarily close our eyes when we do not wish to see any object, and
we are apt to close them, when we reject a proposition, as if we could
not or would not see it; or when we think about something horrible.
We raise our eyebrows when we wish to see quickly all round us, and
we often do the same, when we earnestly desire to remember something;
acting as if we endeavoured to see it.


_Abstraction. Meditation_.--When a person is lost in thought with his
mind absent, or, as it is sometimes said, "when he is in a brown study,"
he does not frown, but his eyes appear vacant. The lower eyelids
are generally raised and wrinkled, in the same manner as when a
short-sighted person tries to distinguish a distant object; and the
upper orbicular muscles are at the same time slightly contracted.
The wrinkling of the lower eyelids under these circumstances has been
observed with some savages, as by Mr. Dyson Lacy with the Australians
of Queensland, and several times by Mr. Geach with the Malays of the
interior of Malacca. What the meaning or cause of this action may be,
cannot at present be explained; but here we have another instance of
movement round the eyes in relation to the state of the mind.

The vacant expression of the eyes is very peculiar, and at once shows
when a man is completely lost in thought. Professor Donders has, with
his usual kindness, investigated this subject for me. He has observed
others in this condition, and has been himself observed by Professor
Engelmann. The eyes are not then fixed on any object, and therefore not,
as I had imagined, on some distant object. The lines of vision of the
two eyes even often become slightly divergent; the divergence, if the
head be held vertically, with the plane of vision horizontal, amounting
to an angle of 2'0 as a maximum. This was ascertained by observing the
crossed double image of a distant object. When the head droops forward,
as often occurs with a man absorbed in thought, owing to the general
relaxation of his muscles, if the plane of vision be still horizontal,
the eyes are necessarily a little turned upwards, and then the
divergence is as much as 3'0, or 3'0 5': if the eyes are turned still
more upwards, it amounts to between 6'0 and 7'0. Professor Donders
attributes this divergence to the almost complete relaxation of certain
muscles of the eyes, which would be apt to follow from the mind being
wholly absorbed.[906] The active condition of the muscles of the eyes is
that of convergence; and Professor Donders remarks, as bearing on their
divergence during a period of complete abstraction, that when one eye
becomes blind, it almost always, after a short lapse of time, deviates
outwards; for its muscles are no longer used in moving the eyeball
inwards for the sake of binocular vision.

Perplexed reflection is often accompanied by certain movements or
gestures. At such times we commonly raise our hands to our foreheads,
mouths, or chins; but we do not act thus, as far as I have seen, when we
are quite lost in meditation, and no difficulty is encountered. Plautus,
describing in one of his plays[907] a puzzled man, says, "Now look, he
has pillared his chin upon his hand." Even so trifling and apparently
unmeaning a gesture as the raising of the hand to the face has been
observed with some savages. Al. J. Mansel Weale has seen it with the
Kafirs of South Africa; and the native chief Gaika adds, that men then
"sometimes pull their beards." Mr. Washington Matthews, who attended
to some of the wildest tribes of Indians in the western regions of the
United States, remarks that he has seen them when concentrating their
thoughts, bring their "hands, usually the thumb and index finger, in
contact with some part of the face, commonly the upper lip." We can
understand why the forehead should be pressed or rubbed, as deep thought
tries the brain; but why the hand should be raised to the mouth or face
is far from clear.

_Ill-temper_.--We have seen that frowning is the natural expression of
some difficulty encountered, or of something disagreeable experienced
either in thought or action, and he whose mind is often and readily
affected in this way, will be apt to be ill-tempered, or slightly
angry, or peevish, and will commonly show it by frowning. But a cross
expression, due to a frown, may be counteracted, if the mouth appears
sweet, from being habitually drawn into a smile, and the eyes are bright
and cheerful. So it will be if the eye is clear and steady, and there is
the appearance of earnest reflection. Frowning, with some depression
of the corners of the mouth, which is a sign of grief, gives an air of
peevishness. If a child (see Plate IV., fig. 2)[908] frowns much whilst
crying, but does not strongly contract in the usual manner the orbicular
muscles, a well-marked expression of anger or even of rage, together
with misery, is displayed.

[Illustration: Ill-temper. Plate IV]

If the whole frowning brow be drawn much downward by the contraction of
the pyramidal muscles of the nose, which produces transverse wrinkles
or folds across the base of the nose, the expression becomes one of
moroseness. Duchenne believes that the contraction of this muscle,
without any frowning, gives the appearance of extreme and aggressive
hardness.[909] But I much doubt whether this is a true or natural
expression. I have shown Duchenne's photograph of a young man, with this
muscle strongly contracted by means of galvanism, to eleven persons,
including some artists, and none of them could form an idea what was
intended, except one, a girl, who answered correctly, "surely reserve."
When I first looked at this photograph, knowing what was intended, my
imagination added, as I believe, what was necessary, namely, a frowning
brow; and consequently the expression appeared to me true and extremely
morose.

A firmly closed mouth, in addition to a lowered and frowning brow, gives
determination to the expression, or may make it obstinate and sullen.
How it comes that the firm closure of the mouth gives the appearance
of determination will presently be discussed. An expression of sullen
obstinacy has been clearly recognized by my informants, in the natives
of six different regions of Australia. It is well marked, according to
Mr. Scott, with the Hindoos. It has been recognized with the Malays,
Chinese, Kafirs, Abyssinians, and in a conspicuous degree, according to
Dr. Rothrock, with the wild Indians of North America, and according to
Mr. D. Forbes, with the Aymaras of Bolivia. I have also observed it with
the Araucanos of southern Chili. Mr. Dyson Lacy remarks that the natives
of Australia, when in this frame of mind, sometimes fold their arms
across their breasts, an attitude which may be seen with us. A firm
determination, amounting to obstinacy, is, also, sometimes expressed by
both shoulders being kept raised, the meaning of which gesture will be
explained in the following chapter.

With young children sulkiness is shown by pouting, or, as it is
sometimes called, "making a snout."[910] When the corners of the mouth
are much depressed, the lower lip is a little everted and protruded;
and this is likewise called a pout. But the pouting here referred to,
consists of the protrusion of both lips into a tubular form, sometimes
to such an extent as to project as far as the end of the nose, if this
be short. Pouting is generally accompanied by frowning, and sometimes
by the utterance of a booing or whooing noise. This expression is
remarkable, as almost the sole one, as far as I know, which is exhibited
much more plainly during childhood, at least with Europeans, than during
maturity. There is, however, some tendency to the protrusion of the lips
with the adults of all races under the influence of great rage. Some
children pout when they are shy, and they can then hardly be called
sulky.

From inquiries which I have made in several large families, pouting does
not seem very common with European children; but it prevails throughout
the world, and must be both common and strongly marked with most savage
races, as it has caught the attention of many observers. It has been
noticed in eight different districts of Australia; and one of my
informants remarks how greatly the lips of the children are then
protruded. Two observers have seen pouting with the children of Hindoos;
three, with those of the Kafirs and Fingoes of South Africa, and with
the Hottentots; and two, with the children of the wild Indians of North
America. Pouting has also been observed with the Chinese, Abyssinians,
Malays of Malacca, Dyaks of Borneo, and often with the New Zealanders.
Mr. Mansel Weale informs me that he has seen the lips much protruded,
not only with the children of the Kafirs, but with the adults of both
sexes when sulky; and Mr. Stack has sometimes observed the same thing
with the men, and very frequently with the women of New Zealand. A trace
of the same expression may occasionally be detected even with adult
Europeans.

We thus see that the protrusion of the lips, especially with young
children, is characteristic of sulkiness throughout the greater part of
the world. This movement apparently results from the retention, chiefly
during youth, of a primordial habit, or from an occasional reversion to
it. Young orangs and chimpanzees protrude their lips to an extraordinary
degree, as described in a former chapter, when they are discontented,
somewhat angry, or sulky; also when they are surprised, a little
frightened, and even when slightly pleased. Their mouths are protruded
apparently for the sake of making the various noises proper to
these several states of mind; and its shape, as I observed with the
chimpanzee, differed slightly when the cry of pleasure and that of anger
were uttered. As soon as these animals become enraged, the shape of the
month wholly changes, and the teeth are exposed. The adult orang when
wounded is said to emit "a singular cry, consisting at first of high
notes, which at length deepen into a low roar. While giving out the high
notes he thrusts out his lips into a funnel shape, but in uttering the
low notes he holds his mouth wide open."[911] With the gorilla, the
lower lip is said to be capable of great elongation. If then our
semi-human progenitors protruded their lips when sulky or a little
angered, in the same manner as do the existing anthropoid apes, it
is not an anomalous, though a curious fact, that our children should
exhibit, when similarly affected, a trace of the same expression,
together with some tendency to utter a noise. For it is not at all
unusual for animals to retain, more or less perfectly, during early
youth, and subsequently to lose, characters which were aboriginally
possessed by their adult progenitors, and which are still retained by
distinct species, their near relations.

Nor is it an anomalous fact that the children of savages should exhibit
a stronger tendency to protrude their lips, when sulky, than the
children of civilized Europeans; for the essence of savagery seems
to consist in the retention of a primordial condition, and this
occasionally holds good even with bodily peculiarities.[912] It may be
objected to this view of the origin of pouting, that the anthropoid
apes likewise protrude their lips when astonished and even when a little
pleased; whilst with us this expression is generally confined to a sulky
frame of mind. But we shall see in a future chapter that with men of
various races surprise does sometimes lead to a slight protrusion of the
lips, though great surprise or astonishment is more commonly shown by
the mouth being widely opened. As when we smile or laugh we draw back
the corners of the mouth, we have lost any tendency to protrude the
lips, when pleased, if indeed our early progenitors thus expressed
pleasure.

A little gesture made by sulky children may here be noticed, namely,
their "showing a cold shoulder." This has a different meaning, as, I
believe, from the keeping both shoulders raised. A cross child, sitting
on its parent's knee, will lift up the near shoulder, then jerk it away,
as if from a caress, and afterwards give a backward push with it, as
if to push away the offender. I have seen a child, standing at some
distance from any one, clearly express its feelings by raising one
shoulder, giving it a little backward movement, and then turning away
its whole body.


_Decision or determination_.--The firm closure of the mouth tends to
give an expression of determination or decision to the countenance.
No determined man probably ever had an habitually gaping mouth. Hence,
also, a small and weak lower jaw, which seems to indicate that the
mouth is not habitually and firmly closed, is commonly thought to be
characteristic of feebleness of character. A prolonged effort of any
kind, whether of body or mind, implies previous determination; and if it
can be shown that the mouth is generally closed with firmness before
and during a great and continued exertion of the muscular system, then,
through the principle of association, the mouth would almost certainly
be closed as soon as any determined resolution was taken. Now several
observers have noticed that a man, in commencing any violent muscular
effort, invariably first distends his lungs with air, and then
compresses it by the strong contraction of the muscles of the chest; and
to effect this the mouth must be firmly closed. Moreover, as soon as
the man is compelled to draw breath, he still keeps his chest as much
distended as possible.

Various causes have been assigned for this manner of acting. Sir C.
Bell maintains[913] that the chest is distended with air, and is kept
distended at such times, in order to give a fixed support to the muscles
which are thereto attached. Hence, as he remarks, when two men are
engaged in a deadly contest, a terrible silence prevails, broken only
by hard stifled breathing. There is silence, because to expel the air in
the utterance of any sound would be to relax the support for the muscles
of the arms. If an outcry is heard, supposing the struggle to take
place in the dark, we at once know that one of the two has given up in
despair.

Gratiolet admits[914] that when a man has to struggle with another to
his utmost, or has to support a great weight, or to keep for a long time
the same forced attitude, it is necessary for him first to make a deep
inspiration, and then to cease breathing; but he thinks that Sir C.
Bell's explanation is erroneous. He maintains that arrested respiration
retards the circulation of the blood, of which I believe there is no
doubt, and he adduces some curious evidence from the structure of the
lower animals, showing, on the one hand, that a retarded circulation is
necessary for prolonged muscular exertion, and, on the other hand, that
a rapid circulation is necessary for rapid movements. According to this
view, when we commence any great exertion, we close our mouths and stop
breathing, in order to retard the circulation of the blood. Gratiolet
sums up the subject by saying, "C'est la la vraie theorie de l'effort
continu;" but how far this theory is admitted by other physiologists I
do not know.

Dr. Piderit accounts[915] for the firm closure of the mouth during
strong muscular exertion, on the principle that the influence of the
will spreads to other muscles besides those necessarily brought into
action in making any particular exertion; and it is natural that the
muscles of respiration and of the mouth, from being so habitually used,
should be especially liable to be thus acted on. It appears to me that
there probably is some truth in this view, for we are apt to press the
teeth hard together during violent exertion, and this is not requisite
to prevent expiration, whilst the muscles of the chest are strongly
contracted.

Lastly, when a man has to perform some delicate and difficult operation,
not requiring the exertion of any strength, he nevertheless generally
closes his mouth and ceases for a time to breathe; but he acts thus
in order that the movements of his chest may not disturb, those of his
arms. A person, for instance, whilst threading a needle, may be seen to
compress his lips and either to stop breathing, or to breathe as quietly
as possible. So it was, as formerly stated, with a young and sick
chimpanzee, whilst it amused itself by killing flies with its knuckles,
as they buzzed about on the window-panes. To perform an action, however
trifling, if difficult, implies some amount of previous determination.

There appears nothing improbable in all the above assigned causes having
come into play in different degrees, either conjointly or separately,
on various occasions. The result would be a well-established habit, now
perhaps inherited, of firmly closing the mouth at the commencement
of and during any violent and prolonged exertion, or any delicate
operation. Through the principle of association there would also be
a strong tendency towards this same habit, as soon as the mind had
resolved on any particular action or line of conduct, even before there
was any bodily exertion, or if none were requisite. The habitual and
firm closure of the mouth would thus come to show decision of character;
and decision readily passes into obstinacy.



CHAPTER X. -- HATRED AND ANGER.

Hatred--Rage, effects of on the system--Uncovering of the teeth--Rage in
the insane--Anger and indignation--As expressed by the various races of
man--Sneering and defiance--The uncovering of the canine tooth on one
side of the face.


IF we have suffered or expect to suffer some wilful injury from a man,
or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike
easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate
degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or
features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behaviour, or by
some ill-temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a
hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or
rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience
merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful,
then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel
master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity.[1001] Most of
our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they
hardly exist if the body remains passive--the nature of the expression
depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been
habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man,
for instance, may know that his life is in the extremest peril, and may
strongly desire to save if; yet, as Louis XVI. said, when surrounded by
a fierce mob, "Am I afraid? feel my pulse." So a man may intensely hate
another, but until his bodily frame is affected, he cannot be said to be
enraged.


_Rage_.--I have already had occasion to treat of this emotion in the
third chapter, when discussing the direct influence of the excited
sensorium on the body, in combination with the effects of habitually
associated actions. Rage exhibits itself in the most diversified manner.
The heart and circulation are always affected; the face reddens or
becomes purple, with the veins on the forehead and neck distended. The
reddening of the skin has been observed with the copper-coloured Indians
of South America,[1002] and even, as it is said, on the white cicatrices
left by old wounds on negroes.[1003] Monkeys also redden from passion.
With one of my own infants, under four months old, I repeatedly observed
that the first symptom of an approaching passion was the rushing of the
blood into his bare scalp. On the other hand, the action of the heart
is sometimes so much impeded by great rage, that the countenance becomes
pallid or livid,[1004] and not a few men with heart-disease have dropped
down dead under this powerful emotion.

The respiration is likewise affected; the chest heaves, and the dilated
nostrils quiver.[1005] As Tennyson writes, "sharp breaths of anger
puffed her fairy nostrils out." Hence we have such expressions as
"breathing out vengeance," and "fuming with anger."[1006]

The excited brain gives strength to the muscles, and at the same time
energy to the will. The body is commonly held erect ready for instant
action, but sometimes it is bent forward towards the offending person,
with the limbs more or less rigid. The mouth is generally closed with
firmness, showing fixed determination, and the teeth are clenched or
ground together. Such gestures as the raising of the arms, with the
fists clenched, as if to strike the offender, are common. Few men in a
great passion, and telling some one to begone, can resist acting as
if they intended to strike or push the man violently away. The desire,
indeed, to strike often becomes so intolerably strong, that inanimate
objects are struck or dashed to the ground; but the gestures frequently
become altogether purposeless or frantic. Young children, when in a
violent rage roll on the ground on their backs or bellies, screaming,
kicking, scratching, or biting everything within reach. So it is, as I
hear from Mr. Scott, with Hindoo children; and, as we have seen, with
the young of the anthropomorphous apes.

But the muscular system is often affected in a wholly different way; for
trembling is a frequent consequence of extreme rage. The paralysed
lips then refuse to obey the will, "and the voice sticks in the
throat;"[1007] or it is rendered loud, harsh, and discordant. If
there be much and rapid speaking, the mouth froths. The hair sometimes
bristles; but I shall return to this subject in another chapter, when I
treat of the mingled emotions of rage and terror. There is in most cases
a strongly-marked frown on the forehead; for this follows from the sense
of anything displeasing or difficult, together with concentration of
mind. But sometimes the brow, instead of being much contracted and
lowered, remains smooth, with the glaring eyes kept widely open. The
eyes are always bright, or may, as Homer expresses it, glisten with
fire. They are sometimes bloodshot, and are said to protrude from their
sockets--the result, no doubt, of the head being gorged with blood, as
shown by the veins being distended. According to Gratiolet, "the pupils
are always contracted in rage," and I hear from Dr. Crichton Browne that
this is the case in the fierce delirium of meningitis; but the movements
of the iris under the influence of the different emotions is a very
obscure subject.

Shakspeare sums up the chief characteristics of rage as follows:--

      "In peace there's nothing so becomes a man,
      As modest stillness and humility;
      But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
      Then imitate the action of the tiger:
      Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
      Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
      Now set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide,
      Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit
      To his full height! On, on, you noblest English."
     _Henry V_., act iii. sc. 1.


The lips are sometimes protruded during rage in a manner, the meaning
of which I do not understand, unless it depends on our descent from some
ape-like animal. Instances have been observed, not only with Europeans,
but with the Australians and Hindoos. The lips, however, are much more
commonly retracted, the grinning or clenched teeth being thus
exposed. This has been noticed by almost every one who has written on
expression.[1009] The appearance is as if the teeth were uncovered,
ready for seizing or tearing an enemy, though there may be no intention
of acting in this manner. Mr. Dyson Lacy has seen this grinning
expression with the Australians, when quarrelling, and so has Gaika with
the Kafirs of South America. Dickens,[1010] in speaking of an atrocious
murderer who had just been caught, and was surrounded by a furious mob,
describes "the people as jumping up one behind another, snarling with
their teeth, and making at him like wild beasts." Every one who has had
much to do with young children must have seen how naturally they take to
biting, when in a passion. It seems as instinctive in them as in young
crocodiles, who snap their little jaws as soon as they emerge from the
egg.

A grinning expression and the protrusion of the lips appear sometimes
to go together. A close observer says that he has seen many instances
of intense hatred (which can hardly be distinguished from rage, more or
less suppressed) in Orientals, and once in an elderly English woman. In
all these cases there "was a grin, not a scowl--the lips lengthening,
the cheeks settling downwards, the eyes half-closed, whilst the brow
remained perfectly calm."[1011]

This retraction of the lips and uncovering of the teeth during paroxysms
of rage, as if to bite the offender, is so remarkable, considering how
seldom the teeth are used by men in fighting, that I inquired from Dr.
J. Crichton Browne whether the habit was common in the insane whose
passions are unbridled. He informs me that he has repeatedly observed
it both with the insane and idiotic, and has given me the following
illustrations:--

Shortly before receiving my letter, he witnessed an uncontrollable
outbreak of anger and delusive jealousy in an insane lady. At first she
vituperated her husband, and whilst doing so foamed at the mouth. Next
she approached close to him with compressed lips, and a virulent set
frown. Then she drew back her lips, especially the corners of the upper
lip, and showed her teeth, at the same time aiming a vicious blow at
him. A second case is that of an old soldier, who, when he is requested
to conform to the rules of the establishment, gives way to discontent,
terminating in fury. He commonly begins by asking Dr. Browne whether
he is not ashamed to treat him in such a manner. He then swears and
blasphemes, paces tip and down, tosses his arms wildly about, and
menaces any one near him. At last, as his exasperation culminates, he
rushes up towards Dr. Browne with a peculiar sidelong movement, shaking
his doubled fist, and threatening destruction. Then his upper lip may
be seen to be raised, especially at the corners, so that his huge canine
teeth are exhibited. He hisses forth his curses through his set teeth,
and his whole expression assumes the character of extreme ferocity.
A similar description is applicable to another man, excepting that he
generally foams at the mouth and spits, dancing and jumping about in
a strange rapid manner, shrieking out his maledictions in a shrill
falsetto voice.

Dr. Browne also informs me of the case of an epileptic idiot, incapable
of independent movements, and who spends the whole day in playing with
some toys; but his temper is morose and easily roused into fierceness.
When any one touches his toys, he slowly raises his head from its
habitual downward position, and fixes his eyes on the offender, with a
tardy yet angry scowl. If the annoyance be repeated, he draws back his
thick lips and reveals a prominent row of hideous fangs (large canines
being especially noticeable), and then makes a quick and cruel clutch
with his open hand at the offending person. The rapidity of this clutch,
as Dr. Browne remarks, is marvellous in a being ordinarily so torpid
that he takes about fifteen seconds, when attracted by any noise, to
turn his head from one side to the other. If, when thus incensed, a
handkerchief, book, or other article, be placed into his hands, he drags
it to his mouth and bites it. Mr. Nicol has likewise described to me two
cases of insane patients, whose lips are retracted during paroxysms of
rage.

Dr. Maudsley, after detailing various strange animal-like traits in
idiots, asks whether these are not due to the reappearance of primitive
instincts--"a faint echo from a far-distant past, testifying to a
kinship which man has almost outgrown." He adds, that as every human
brain passes, in the course of its development, through the same stages
as those occurring in the lower vertebrate animals, and as the brain
of an idiot is in an arrested condition, we may presume that it "will
manifest its most primitive functions, and no higher functions." Dr.
Maudsley thinks that the same view may be extended to the brain in its
degenerated condition in some insane patients; and asks, whence come
"the savage snarl, the destructive disposition, the obscene language,
the wild howl, the offensive habits, displayed by some of the insane?
Why should a human being, deprived of his reason, ever become so
brutal in character, as some do, unless he has the brute nature within
him?"[1012] This question must, as it would appear, he answered in the
affirmative.

_Anger, Indignation_.--These states of the mind differ from rage only
in degree, and there is no marked distinction in their characteristic
signs. Under moderate anger the action of the heart is a little
increased, the colour heightened, and the eyes become bright. The
respiration is likewise a little hurried; and as all the muscles serving
for this function act in association, the wings of the nostrils are
somewhat raised to allow of a free indraught of air; and this is
a highly characteristic sign of indignation. The mouth is commonly
compressed, and there is almost always a frown on the brow. Instead of
the frantic gestures of extreme rage, an indignant man unconsciously
throws himself into an attitude ready for attacking or striking his
enemy, whom he will perhaps scan from head to foot in defiance. He
carries his head erect, with his chest well expanded, and the feet
planted firmly on the ground. He holds his arms in various positions,
with one or both elbows squared, or with the arms rigidly suspended by
his sides. With Europeans the fists are commonly clenched.[1013] The
figures 1 and 2 in Plate VI. are fairly good representations of men
simulating indignation. Any one may see in a mirror, if he will vividly
imagine that he has been insulted and demands an explanation in an angry
tone of voice, that he suddenly and unconsciously throws himself into
some such attitude.

[Illustration: Anger and Indignation.  Plate VI]

Rage, anger, and indignation are exhibited in nearly the same manner
throughout the world; and the following descriptions may be worth giving
as evidence of this, and as illustrations of some of the foregoing
remarks. There is, however, an exception with respect to clenching the
fists, which seems confined chiefly to the men who fight with their
fists. With the Australians only one of my informants has seen the fists
clenched. All agree about the body being held erect; and all, with two
exceptions, state that the brows are heavily contracted. Some of them
allude to the firmly-compressed mouth, the distended nostrils, and
flashing eyes. According to the Rev. Mr. Taplin, rage, with the
Australians, is expressed by the lips being protruded, the eyes being
widely open; and in the case of the women by their dancing about and
casting dust into the air. Another observer speaks of the native men,
when enraged, throwing their arms wildly about.

I have received similar accounts, except as to the clenching of
the fists, in regard to the Malays of the Malacca peninsula, the
Abyssinians, and the natives of South Africa. So it is with the Dakota
Indians of North America; and, according to Mr. Matthews, they then hold
their heads erect, frown, and often stalk away with long strides. Mr.
Bridges states that the Fuegians, when enraged, frequently stamp on the
ground, walk distractedly about, sometimes cry and grow pale. The Rev.
Mr. Stack watched a New Zealand man and woman quarrelling, and made the
following entry in his note-book: "Eyes dilated, body swayed violently
backwards and forwards, head inclined forwards, fists clenched, now
thrown behind the body, now directed towards each other's faces." Mr.
Swinhoe says that my description agrees with what he has seen of the
Chinese, excepting that an angry man generally inclines his body towards
his antagonist, and pointing at him, pours forth a volley of abuse.

Lastly, with respect to the natives of India, Mr. J. Scott has sent me
a full description of their gestures and expression when enraged. Two
low-caste Bengalees disputed about a loan. At first they were calm, but
soon grew furious and poured forth the grossest abuse on each other's
relations and progenitors for many generations past. Their gestures were
very different from those of Europeans; for though their chests were
expanded and shoulders squared, their arms remained rigidly suspended,
with the elbows turned inwards and the hands alternately clenched and
opened. Their shoulders were often raised high, and then again lowered.
They looked fiercely at each other from under their lowered and strongly
wrinkled brows, and their protruded lips were firmly closed. They
approached each other, with heads and necks stretched forwards, and
pushed, scratched, and grasped at each other. This protrusion of the
head and body seems a common gesture with the enraged; and I have
noticed it with degraded English women whilst quarrelling violently in
the streets. In such cases it may be presumed that neither party expects
to receive a blow from the other.

A Bengalee employed in the Botanic Gardens was accused, in the presence
of Mr. Scott, by the native overseer of having stolen a valuable plant.
He listened silently and scornfully to the accusation; his attitude
erect, chest expanded, mouth closed, lips protruding, eyes firmly
set and penetrating. He then defiantly maintained his innocence, with
upraised and clenched hands, his head being now pushed forwards, with
the eyes widely open and eyebrows raised. Mr. Scott also watched two
Mechis, in Sikhim, quarrelling about their share of payment. They soon
got into a furious passion, and then their bodies became less erect,
with their heads pushed forwards; they made grimaces at each other;
their shoulders were raised; their arms rigidly bent inwards at the
elbows, and their hands spasmodically closed, but not properly clenched.
They continually approached and retreated from each other, and often
raised their arms as if to strike, but their hands were open, and no
blow was given. Mr. Scott made similar observations on the Lepchas whom
he often saw quarrelling, and he noticed that they kept their arms rigid
and almost parallel to their bodies, with the hands pushed somewhat
backwards and partially closed, but not clenched.


_Sneering, Defiance: Uncovering the canine tooth on one side_.--The
expression which I wish here to consider differs but little from that
already described, when the lips are retracted and the grinning teeth
exposed. The difference consists solely in the upper lip being retracted
in such a manner that the canine tooth on one side of the face alone
is shown; the face itself being generally a little upturned and half
averted from the person causing offence. The other signs of rage are not
necessarily present. This expression may occasionally be observed in
a person who sneers at or defies another, though there may be no real
anger; as when any one is playfully accused of some fault, and answers,
"I scorn the imputation." The expression is not a common one, but I
have seen it exhibited with perfect distinctness by a lady who was being
quizzed by another person. It was described by Parsons as long ago as
1746, with an engraving, showing the uncovered canine on one side.[1014]
Mr. Rejlander, without my having made any allusion to the subject,
asked me whether I had ever noticed this expression, as he had been much
struck by it. He has photographed for me (Plate IV. fig 1) a lady, who
sometimes unintentionally displays the canine on one side, and who can
do so voluntarily with unusual distinctness.

The expression of a half-playful sneer graduates into one of great
ferocity when, together with a heavily frowning brow and fierce eye, the
canine tooth is exposed. A Bengalee boy was accused before Mr. Scott of
some misdeed. The delinquent did not dare to give vent to his wrath
in words, but it was plainly shown on his countenance, sometimes by a
defiant frown, and sometimes "by a thoroughly canine snarl." When this
was exhibited, "the corner of the lip over the eye-tooth, which happened
in this case to be large and projecting, was raised on the side of his
accuser, a strong frown being still retained on the brow." Sir C. Bell
states[1015] that the actor Cooke could express the most determined hate
"when with the oblique cast of his eyes he drew up the outer part of the
upper lip, and discovered a sharp angular tooth."

The uncovering of the canine tooth is the result of a double movement.
The angle or corner of the mouth is drawn a little backwards, and at the
same time a muscle which runs parallel to and near the nose draws up the
outer part of the upper lip, and exposes the canine on this side of
the face. The contraction of this muscle makes a distinct furrow on the
cheek, and produces strong wrinkles under the eye, especially at its
inner corner. The action is the same as that of a snarling dog; and a
dog when pretending to fight often draws up the lip on one side alone,
namely that facing his antagonist. Our word _sneer_ is in fact the
same as _snarl_, which was originally _snar_, the _l_ "being merely an
element implying continuance of action."[1016]

I suspect that we see a trace of this same expression in what is called
a derisive or sardonic smile. The lips are then kept joined or almost
joined, but one corner of the mouth is retracted on the side towards the
derided person; and this drawing back of the corner is part of a true
sneer. Although some persons smile more on one side of their face than
on the other, it is not easy to understand why in cases of derision the
smile, if a real one, should so commonly be confined to one side. I have
also on these occasions noticed a slight twitching of the muscle which
draws up the outer part of the upper lip; and this movement, if fully
carried out, would have uncovered the canine, and would have produced a
true sneer.

Mr. Bulmer, an Australian missionary in a remote part of Gipps' Land,
says, in answer to my query about the uncovering of the canine on one
side, "I find that the natives in snarling at each other speak with
the teeth closed, the upper lip drawn to one side, and a general angry
expression of face; but they look direct at the person addressed." Three
other observers in Australia, one in Abyssinia, and one in China, answer
my query on this head in the affirmative; but as the expression is rare,
and as they enter into no details, I am afraid of implicitly trusting
them. It is, however, by no means improbable that this animal-like
expression may be more common with savages than with civilized races.
Mr. Geach is an observer who may be fully trusted, and he has observed
it on one occasion in a Malay in the interior of Malacca. The Rev. S.
O. Glenie answers, "We have observed this expression with the natives of
Ceylon, but not often." Lastly, in North America, Dr. Rothrock has seen
it with some wild Indians, and often in a tribe adjoining the Atnahs.

Although the upper lip is certainly sometimes raised on one side alone
in sneering at or defying any one, I do not know that this is always the
case, for the face is commonly half averted, and the expression is
often momentary. The movement being confined to one side may not be an
essential part of the expression, but may depend on the proper muscles
being incapable of movement excepting on one side. I asked four persons
to endeavour to act voluntarily in this manner; two could expose the
canine only on the left side, one only on the right side, and the fourth
on neither side. Nevertheless it is by no means certain that these same
persons, if defying any one in earnest, would not unconsciously
have uncovered their canine tooth on the side, whichever it might
be, towards the offender. For we have seen that some persons cannot
voluntarily make their eyebrows oblique, yet instantly act in this
manner when affected by any real, although most trifling, cause of
distress. The power of voluntarily uncovering the canine on one side
of the face being thus often wholly lost, indicates that it is a rarely
used and almost abortive action. It is indeed a surprising fact that man
should possess the power, or should exhibit any tendency to its use; for
Mr. Sutton has never noticed a snarling action in our nearest allies,
namely, the monkeys in the Zoological Gardens, and he is positive that
the baboons, though furnished with great canines, never act thus, but
uncover all their teeth when feeling savage and ready for an attack.
Whether the adult anthropomorphous apes, in the males of whom the
canines are much larger than in the females, uncover them when prepared
to fight, is not known.

The expression here considered, whether that of a playful sneer or
ferocious snarl, is one of the most curious which occurs in man. It
reveals his animal descent; for no one, even if rolling on the ground in
a deadly grapple with an enemy, and attempting to bite him, would try to
use his canine teeth more than his other teeth. We may readily believe
from our affinity to the anthropomorphous apes that our male semi-human
progenitors possessed great canine teeth, and men are now occasionally
born having them of unusually large size, with interspaces in the
opposite jaw for their reception.[1017] We may further suspect,
notwithstanding that we have no support from analogy, that our
semi-human progenitors uncovered their canine teeth when prepared for
battle, as we still do when feeling ferocious, or when merely sneering
at or defying some one, without any intention of making a real attack
with our teeth.



CHAPTER XI. -- DISDAIN--CONTEMPT--DISGUST-GUILT--PRIDE, ETC.--HELPLESSNESS--PATIENCE--AFFIRMATION AND NEGATION.

Contempt, scorn and disdain, variously expressed--Derisive
smile--Gestures expressive of contempt--Disgust--Guilt, deceit, pride,
&c.--Helplessness or impotence--Patience--Obstinacy--Shrugging the
shoulders common to most of the races of man--Signs of affirmation and
negation.


SCORN and disdain can hardly be distinguished from contempt, excepting
that they imply a rather more angry frame of mind. Nor can they be
clearly distinguished from the feelings discussed in the last chapter
under the terms of sneering and defiance. Disgust is a sensation rather
more distinct in its nature and refers to something revolting, primarily
in relation to the sense of taste, as actually perceived or vividly
imagined; and secondarily to anything which causes a similar feeling,
through the sense of smell, touch, and even of eyesight. Nevertheless,
extreme contempt, or as it is often called loathing contempt, hardly
differs from disgust. These several conditions of the mind are,
therefore, nearly related; and each of them may be exhibited in many
different ways. Some writers have insisted chiefly on one mode of
expression, and others on a different mode. From this circumstance M.
Lemoine has argued[1101] that their descriptions are not trustworthy.
But we shall immediately see that it is natural that the feelings which
we have here to consider should be expressed in many different ways,
inasmuch as various habitual actions serve equally well, through the
principle of association, for their expression.

Scorn and disdain, as well as sneering and defiance, may be displayed
by a slight uncovering of the canine tooth on one side of the face; and
this movement appears to graduate into one closely like a smile. Or the
smile or laugh may be real, although one of derision; and this implies
that the offender is so insignificant that he excites only amusement;
but the amusement is generally a pretence. Gaika in his answers to my
queries remarks, that contempt is commonly shown by his countrymen, the
Kafirs, by smiling; and the Rajah Brooke makes the same observation with
respect to the Dyaks of Borneo. As laughter is primarily the expression
of simple joy, very young children do not, I believe, ever laugh in
derision.

The partial closure of the eyelids, as Duchenne[1102] insists, or the
turning away of the eyes or of the whole body, are likewise highly
expressive of disdain. These actions seem to declare that the despised
person is not worth looking at or is disagreeable to behold. The
accompanying photograph (Plate V. fig. 1) by Mr. Rejlander, shows this
form of disdain. It represents a young lady, who is supposed to be
tearing up the photograph of a despised lover.

[Illustration: Scorn and Disdain.  Plate V]

The most common method of expressing contempt is by movements about
the nose, or round the mouth; but the latter movements, when strongly
pronounced, indicate disgust. The nose may be slightly turned up, which
apparently follows from the turning up of the upper lip; or the movement
may be abbreviated into the mere wrinkling of the nose. The nose is
often slightly contracted, so as partly to close the passage;[1103] and
this is commonly accompanied by a slight snort or expiration. All these
actions are the same with those which we employ when we perceive an
offensive odour, and wish to exclude or expel it. In extreme cases, as
Dr. Piderit remarks,[1104] we protrude and raise both lips, or the upper
lip alone, so as to close the nostrils as by a valve, the nose being
thus turned up. We seem thus to say to the despised person that he
smells offensively,[1105] in nearly the same manner as we express to him
by half-closing our eyelids, or turning away our faces, that he is not
worth looking at. It must not, however, be supposed that such ideas
actually pass through the mind when we exhibit our contempt; but as
whenever we have perceived a disagreeable odour or seen a disagreeable
sight, actions of this kind have been performed, they have become
habitual or fixed, and are now employed under any analogous state of
mind.

Various odd little gestures likewise indicate contempt; for instance,
_snapping one's fingers_. This, as Mr. Taylor remarks,[1106] "is not
very intelligible as we generally see it; but when we notice that the
same sign made quite gently, as if rolling some tiny object away
between the finger and thumb, or the sign of flipping it away with the
thumb-nail and forefinger, are usual and well-understood deaf-and-dumb
gestures, denoting anything tiny, insignificant, contemptible, it seems
as though we had exaggerated and conventionalized a perfectly natural
action, so as to lose sight of its original meaning. There is a curious
mention of this gesture by Strabo." Mr. Washington Matthews informs me
that, with the Dakota Indians of North America, contempt is shown
not only by movements of the face, such as those above described, but
"conventionally, by the hand being closed and held near the breast,
then, as the forearm is suddenly extended, the hand is opened and the
fingers separated from each other. If the person at whose expense the
sign is made is present, the hand is moved towards him, and the head
sometimes averted from him." This sudden extension and opening of the
hand perhaps indicates the dropping or throwing away a valueless object.

The term 'disgust,' in its simplest sense, means something offensive to
the taste. It is curious how readily this feeling is excited by anything
unusual in the appearance, odour, or nature of our food. In Tierra del
Fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved meat which
I was eating at our bivouac, and plainly showed utter disgust at its
softness; whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a
naked savage, though his hands did not appear dirty. A smear of soup
on a man's beard looks disgusting, though there is of course nothing
disgusting in the soup itself. I presume that this follows from the
strong association in our minds between the sight of food, however
circumstanced, and the idea of eating it.

As the sensation of disgust primarily arises in connection with the act
of eating or tasting, it is natural that its expression should consist
chiefly in movements round the mouth. But as disgust also causes
annoyance, it is generally accompanied by a frown, and often by gestures
as if to push away or to guard oneself against the offensive object.
In the two photographs (figs. 2 and 3, on Plate V.) Mr. Rejlander has
simulated this expression with some success. With respect to the face,
moderate disgust is exhibited in various ways; by the mouth being widely
opened, as if to let an offensive morsel drop out; by spitting; by
blowing out of the protruded lips; or by a sound as of clearing the
throat. Such guttural sounds are written _ach_ or _ugh_; and their
utterance is sometimes accompanied by a shudder, the arms being pressed
close to the sides and the shoulders raised in the same manner as when
horror is experienced.[1107] Extreme disgust is expressed by movements
round the month identical with those preparatory to the act of vomiting.
The mouth is opened widely, with the upper lip strongly retracted, which
wrinkles the sides of the nose, and with the lower lip protruded
and everted as much as possible. This latter movement requires the
contraction of the muscles which draw downwards the corners of the
mouth.[1108]

It is remarkable how readily and instantly retching or actual vomiting
is induced in some persons by the mere idea of having partaken of any
unusual food, as of an animal which is not commonly eaten; although
there is nothing in such food to cause the stomach to reject it. When
vomiting results, as a reflex action, from some real cause--as from
too rich food, or tainted meat, or from an emetic--it does not ensue
immediately, but generally after a considerable interval of time.
Therefore, to account for retching or vomiting being so quickly and
easily excited by a mere idea, the suspicion arises that our progenitors
must formerly have had the power (like that possessed by ruminants and
some other animals) of voluntarily rejecting food which disagreed with
them, or which they thought would disagree with them; and now, though
this power has been lost, as far as the will is concerned, it is
called into involuntary action, through the force of a formerly
well-established habit, whenever the mind revolts at the idea of having
partaken of any kind of food, or at anything disgusting. This suspicion
receives support from the fact, of which I am assured by Mr. Sutton,
that the monkeys in the Zoological Gardens often vomit whilst in perfect
health, which looks as if the act were voluntary. We can see that as
man is able to communicate by language to his children and others,
the knowledge of the kinds of food to be avoided, he would have little
occasion to use the faculty of voluntary rejection; so that this power
would tend to be lost through disuse.

As the sense of smell is so intimately connected with that of taste, it
is not surprising that an excessively bad odour should excite retching
or vomiting in some persons, quite as readily as the thought of
revolting food does; and that, as a further consequence, a moderately
offensive odour should cause the various expressive movements of
disgust. The tendency to retch from a fetid odour is immediately
strengthened in a curious manner by some degree of habit, though soon
lost by longer familiarity with the cause of offence and by voluntary
restraint. For instance, I wished to clean the skeleton of a bird, which
had not been sufficiently macerated, and the smell made my servant
and myself (we not having had much experience in such work) retch so
violently, that we were compelled to desist. During the previous days I
had examined some other skeletons, which smelt slightly; yet the odour
did not in the least affect me, but, subsequently for several days,
whenever I handled these same skeletons, they made me retch.

From the answers received from my correspondents it appears that the
various movements, which have now been described as expressing contempt
and disgust, prevail throughout a large part of the world. Dr. Rothrock,
for instance, answers with a decided affirmative with respect to certain
wild Indian tribes of North America. Crantz says that when a Greenlander
denies anything with contempt or horror he turns up his nose, and
gives a slight sound through it.[1109] Mr. Scott has sent me a graphic
description of the face of a young Hindoo at the sight of castor-oil,
which he was compelled occasionally to take. Mr. Scott has also seen the
same expression on the faces of high-caste natives who have approached
close to some defiling object. Mr. Bridges says that the Fuegians
"express contempt by shooting out the lips and hissing through them, and
by turning up the nose." The tendency either to snort through the nose,
or to make a noise expressed by _ugh_ or _ach_, is noticed by several of
my correspondents.

Spitting seems an almost universal sign of contempt or disgust; and
spitting obviously represents the rejection of anything offensive
from the mouth. Shakspeare makes the Duke of Norfolk say, "I spit at
him--call him a slanderous coward and a villain." So, again, Falstaff
says, "Tell thee what, Hal,--if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face."
Leichhardt remarks that the Australians "interrupted their speeches by
spitting, and uttering a noise like pooh! pooh! apparently expressive of
their disgust." And Captain Burton speaks of certain negroes "spitting
with disgust upon the ground." Captain Speedy informs me that this is
likewise the case with the Abyssinians. Mr. Geach says that with the
Malays of Malacca the expression of disgust "answers to spitting from
the mouth;" and with the Fuegians, according to Mr. Bridges "to spit at
one is the highest mark of contempt."

I never saw disgust more plainly expressed than on the face of one of my
infants at the age of five months, when, for the first time, some cold
water, and again a month afterwards, when a piece of ripe cherry was put
into his mouth. This was shown by the lips and whole mouth assuming a
shape which allowed the contents to run or fall quickly out; the tongue
being likewise protruded. These movements were accompanied by a little
shudder. It was all the more comical, as I doubt whether the child
felt real disgust--the eyes and forehead expressing much surprise and
consideration. The protrusion of the tongue in letting a nasty object
fall out of the mouth, may explain how it is that lolling out the tongue
universally serves as a sign of contempt and hatred.[1111]

We have now seen that scorn, disdain, contempt, and disgust are
expressed in many different ways, by movements of the features, and by
various gestures; and that these are the same throughout the world. They
all consist of actions representing the rejection or exclusion of some
real object which we dislike or abhor, but which does not excite in us
certain other strong emotions, such as rage or terror; and through the
force of habit and association similar actions are performed, whenever
any analogous sensation arises in our minds.

_Jealousy, Envy, Avarice, Revenge, Suspicion, Deceit, Slyness, Guilt,
Vanity, Conceit, Ambition, Pride, Humility, &c_.--It is doubtful whether
the greater number of the above complex states of mind are revealed
by any fixed expression, sufficiently distinct to be described or
delineated. When Shakspeare speaks of Envy as _lean-faced_, or _black_,
or _pale_, and Jealousy as "_the green-eyed monster_;" and when Spenser
describes Suspicion as "_foul, ill-favoured, and grim_," they must have
felt this difficulty. Nevertheless, the above feelings--at least many
of them--can be detected by the eye; for instance, conceit; but we are
often guided in a much greater degree than we suppose by our previous
knowledge of the persons or circumstances.

My correspondents almost unanimously answer in the affirmative to my
query, whether the expression of guilt and deceit can be recognized
amongst the various races of man; and I have confidence in their
answers, as they generally deny that jealousy can thus be recognized.
In the cases in which details are given, the eyes are almost always
referred to. The guilty man is said to avoid looking at his accuser, or
to give him stolen looks. The eyes are said "to be turned askant," or
"to waver from side to side," or "the eyelids to be lowered and partly
closed." This latter remark is made by Mr. Hagenauer with respect to
the Australians, and by Gaika with respect to the Kafirs. The restless
movements of the eyes apparently follow, as will be explained when we
treat of blushing, from the guilty man not enduring to meet the gaze
of his accuser. I may add, that I have observed a guilty expression,
without a shade of fear, in some of my own children at a very early age.
In one instance the expression was unmistakably clear in a child two
years and seven months old, and led to the detection of his little
crime. It was shown, as I record in my notes made at the time, by
an unnatural brightness in the eyes, and by an odd, affected manner,
impossible to describe.

Slyness is also, I believe, exhibited chiefly by movements about the
eyes; for these are less under the control of the will, owing to the
force of long-continued habit, than are the movements of the body. Mr.
Herbert Spencer remarks,[1112] "When there is a desire to see something
on one side of the visual field without being supposed to see it, the
tendency is to check the conspicuous movement of the head, and to make
the required adjustment entirely with the eyes; which are, therefore,
drawn very much to one side. Hence, when the eyes are turned to one
side, while the face is not turned to the same side, we get the natural
language of what is called slyness."

Of all the above-named complex emotions, Pride, perhaps, is the most
plainly expressed. A proud man exhibits his sense of superiority over
others by holding his head and body erect. He is haughty (_haut_),
or high, and makes himself appear as large as possible; so that
metaphorically he is said to be swollen or puffed up with pride. A
peacock or a turkey-cock strutting about with puffed-up feathers, is
sometimes said to be an emblem of pride.[1113] The arrogant man looks
down on others, and with lowered eyelids hardly condescends to see them;
or he may show his contempt by slight movements, such as those before
described, about the nostrils or lips. Hence the muscle which everts the
lower lip has been called the _musculus superbus_. In some photographs
of patients affected by a monomania of pride, sent me by Dr. Crichton
Browne, the head and body were held erect, and the mouth firmly closed.
This latter action, expressive of decision, follows, I presume, from
the proud man feeling perfect self-confidence in himself. The whole
expression of pride stands in direct antithesis to that of humility; so
that nothing need here be said of the latter state of mind.


_Helplessness, Impotence: Shrugging the shoulders_.--When a man wishes
to show that he cannot do something, or prevent something being done, he
often raises with a quick movement both shoulders. At the same time,
if the whole gesture is completed, he bends his elbows closely
inwards, raises his open hands, turning them outwards, with the fingers
separated. The head is often thrown a little on one side; the eyebrows
are elevated, and this causes wrinkles across the forehead. The mouth is
generally opened. I may mention, in order to show how unconsciously
the features are thus acted on, that though I had often intentionally
shrugged my shoulders to observe how my arms were placed, I was not at
all aware that my eyebrows were raised and mouth opened, until I looked
at myself in a glass; and since then I have noticed the same movements
in the faces of others. In the accompanying Plate VI., figs. 3 and
4, Mr. Rejlander has successfully acted the gesture of shrugging the
shoulders.

Englishmen are much less demonstrative than the men of most other
European nations, and they shrug their shoulders far less frequently and
energetically than Frenchmen or Italians do. The gesture varies in all
degrees from the complex movement, just described, to only a momentary
and scarcely perceptible raising of both shoulders; or, as I have
noticed in a lady sitting in an arm-chair, to the mere turning slightly
outwards of the open hands with separated fingers. I have never seen
very young English children shrug their shoulders, but the following
case was observed with care by a medical professor and excellent
observer, and has been communicated to me by him. The father of this
gentleman was a Parisian, and his mother a Scotch lady. His wife is of
British extraction on both sides, and my informant does not believe
that she ever shrugged her shoulders in her life. His children have been
reared in England, and the nursemaid is a thorough Englishwoman, who
has never been seen to shrug her shoulders. Now, his eldest daughter
was observed to shrug her shoulders at the age of between sixteen and
eighteen months; her mother exclaiming at the time, "Look at the little
French girl shrugging her shoulders!" At first she often acted thus,
sometimes throwing her head a little backwards and on one side, but she
did not, as far as was observed, move her elbows and hands in the usual
manner. The habit gradually wore away, and now, when she is a little
over four years old, she is never seen to act thus. The father is told
that he sometimes shrugs his shoulders, especially when arguing with
any one; but it is extremely improbable that his daughter should have
imitated him at so early an age; for, as he remarks, she could not
possibly have often seen this gesture in him. Moreover, if the habit
had been acquired through imitation, it is not probable that it would
so soon have been spontaneously discontinued by this child, and, as we
shall immediately see, by a second child, though the father still
lived with his family. This little girl, it may be added, resembles her
Parisian grandfather in countenance to an almost absurd degree. She
also presents another and very curious resemblance to him, namely, by
practising a singular trick. When she impatiently wants something, she
holds out her little hand, and rapidly rubs the thumb against the index
and middle finger: now this same trick was frequently performed under
the same circumstances by her grandfather.

This gentleman's second daughter also shrugged her shoulders before the
age of eighteen months, and afterwards discontinued the habit. It is
of course possible that she may have imitated her elder sister; but she
continued it after her sister had lost the habit. She at first resembled
her Parisian grandfather in a less degree than did her sister at the
same age, but now in a greater degree. She likewise practises to the
present time the peculiar habit of rubbing together, when impatient, her
thumb and two of her fore-fingers.

In this latter case we have a good instance, like those given in a
former chapter, of the inheritance of a trick or gesture; for no one, I
presume, will attribute to mere coincidence so peculiar a habit as this,
which was common to the grandfather and his two grandchildren who had
never seen him.

Considering all the circumstances with reference to these children
shrugging their shoulders, it can hardly be doubted that they have
inherited the habit from their French progenitors, although they
have only one quarter French blood in their veins, and although their
grandfather did not often shrug his shoulders. There is nothing very
unusual, though the fact is interesting, in these children having gained
by inheritance a habit during early youth, and then discontinuing it;
for it is of frequent occurrence with many kinds of animals that certain
characters are retained for a period by the young, and are then lost.

As it appeared to me at one time improbable in a high degree that
so complex a gesture as shrugging the shoulders, together with the
accompanying movements, should be innate, I was anxious to ascertain
whether the blind and deaf Laura Bridgman, who could not have learnt the
habit by imitation, practised it. And I have heard, through Dr. Innes,
from a lady who has lately had charge of her, that she does shrug her
shoulders, turn in her elbows, and raise her eyebrows in the same manner
as other people, and under the same circumstances. I was also anxious
to learn whether this gesture was practised by the various races of man,
especially by those who never have had much intercourse with Europeans.
We shall see that they act in this manner; but it appears that the
gesture is sometimes confined to merely raising or shrugging the
shoulders, without the other movements.

Mr. Scott has frequently seen this gesture in the Bengalees and Dhangars
(the latter constituting a distinct race) who are employed in the
Botanic Garden at Calcutta; when, for instance, they have declared that
they could not do some work, such as lifting a heavy weight. He ordered
a Bengalee to climb a lofty tree; but the man, with a shrug of his
shoulders and a lateral shake of his head, said he could not. Mr. Scott
knowing that the man was lazy, thought he could, and insisted on his
trying. His face now became pale, his arms dropped to his sides, his
mouth and eyes were widely opened, and again surveying the tree, he
looked askant at Mr. Scott, shrugged his shoulders, inverted his elbows,
extended his open hands, and with a few quick lateral shakes of the head
declared his inability. Mr. H. Erskine has likewise seen the natives of
India shrugging their shoulders; but he has never seen the elbows turned
so much inwards as with us; and whilst shrugging their shoulders they
sometimes lay their uncrossed hands on their breasts.

With the wild Malays of the interior of Malacca, and with the Bugis
(true Malays, though speaking a different, language), Mr. Geach has
often seen this gesture. I presume that it is complete, as, in answer to
my query descriptive of the movements of the shoulders, arms, hands, and
face, Mr. Geach remarks, "it is performed in a beautiful style." I
have lost an extract from a scientific voyage, in which shrugging the
shoulders by some natives (Micronesians) of the Caroline Archipelago in
the Pacific Ocean, was well described. Capt. Speedy informs me that the
Abyssinians shrug their shoulders but enters into no details. Mrs. Asa
Gray saw an Arab dragoman in Alexandria acting exactly as described in
my query, when an old gentleman, on whom he attended, would not go in
the proper direction which had been pointed out to him.

Mr. Washington Matthews says, in reference to the wild Indian tribes
of the western parts of the United States, "I have on a few occasions
detected men using a slight apologetic shrug, but the rest of the
demonstration which you describe I have not witnessed." Fritz Muller
informs me that he has seen the negroes in Brazil shrugging their
shoulders; but it is of course possible that they may have learnt to do
so by imitating the Portuguese. Mrs. Barber has never seen this gesture
with the Kafirs of South Africa; and Gaika, judging from his answer,
did not even understand what was meant by my description. Mr. Swinhoe
is also doubtful about the Chinese; but he has seen them, under the
circumstances which would make us shrug our shoulders, press their right
elbow against their side, raise their eyebrows, lift up their hand with
the palm directed towards the person addressed, and shake it from right
to left. Lastly, with respect to the Australians, four of my informants
answer by a simple negative, and one by a simple affirmative. Mr.
Bunnett, who has had excellent opportunities for observation on the
borders of the Colony of Victory, also answers by a "yes," adding that
the gesture is performed "in a more subdued and less demonstrative
manner than is the case with civilized nations." This circumstance may
account for its not having been noticed by four of my informants.

These statements, relating to Europeans, Hindoos, the hill-tribes of
India, Malays, Micronesians, Abyssinians, Arabs, Negroes, Indians of
North America, and apparently to the Australians--many of these natives
having had scarcely any intercourse with Europeans--are sufficient to
show that shrugging the shoulders, accompanied in some cases by the
other proper movements, is a gesture natural to mankind.

This gesture implies an unintentional or unavoidable action on our own
part, or one that we cannot perform; or an action performed by another
person which we cannot prevent. It accompanies such speeches as, "It was
not my fault;" "It is impossible for me to grant this favour;" "He
must follow his own course, I cannot stop him." Shrugging the shoulders
likewise expresses patience, or the absence of any intention to resist.
Hence the muscles which raise the shoulders are sometimes called, as I
have been informed by an artist, the patience muscles. Shylock the Jew,
says,

      "Signor Antonio, many a time and oft
      In the Rialto have you rated me
      About my monies and usances;
      Still have I borne it with a patient shrug."
     _Merchant of Venice_, act 1. sc. 3.


Sir C. Bell has given[1114] a life-like figure of a man, who is
shrinking back from some terrible danger, and is on the point of
screaming out in abject terror. He is represented with his shoulders
lifted up almost to his ears; and this at once declares that there is no
thought of resistance.

As shrugging the shoulders generally implies "I cannot do this or
that," so by a slight change, it sometimes implies "I won't do it."
The movement then expresses a dogged determination not to act. Olmsted
describes[1115] an Indian in Texas as giving a great shrug to his
shoulders, when he was informed that a party of men were Germans and not
Americans, thus expressing that he would have nothing to do with them.
Sulky and obstinate children may be seen with both their shoulders
raised high up; but this movement is not associated with the others
which generally accompany a true shrug. An excellent observer[1116] in
describing a young man who was determined not to yield to his father's
desire, says, "He thrust his hands deep down into his pockets, and set
up his shoulders to his ears, which was a good warning that, come right
or wrong, this rock should fly from its firm base as soon as Jack would;
and that any remonstrance on the subject was purely futile." As soon
as the son got his own way, he "put his shoulders into their natural
position."

Resignation is sometimes shown by the open hands being placed, one over
the other, on the lower part of the body. I should not have thought this
little gesture worth even a passing notice, had not Dr. W. Ogle remarked
to me that he had two or three times observed it in patients who were
preparing for operations under chloroform. They exhibited no great fear,
but seemed to declare by this posture of their hands, that they had made
up their minds, and were resigned to the inevitable.

We may now inquire why men in all parts of the world when they
feel,--whether or not they wish to show this feeling,--that they cannot
or will not do something, or will not resist something if done by
another, shrug their shoulders, at the same time often bending in their
elbows, showing the palms of their hands with extended fingers, often
throwing their heads a little on one side, raising their eyebrows,
and opening their mouths. These states of the mind are either simply
passive, or show a determination not to act. None of the above movements
are of the least service. The explanation lies, I cannot doubt, in the
principle of unconscious antithesis. This principle here seems to come
into play as clearly as in the case of a dog, who, when feeling savage,
puts himself in the proper attitude for attacking and for making himself
appear terrible to his enemy; but as soon as he feels affectionate,
throws his whole body into a directly opposite attitude, though this is
of no direct use to him.

Let it be observed how an indignant man, who resents, and will not
submit to some injury, holds his head erect, squares his shoulders, and
expands his chest. He often clenches his fists, and puts one or both
arms in the proper position for attack or defence, with the muscles
of his limbs rigid. He frowns,--that is, he contracts and lowers
his brows,--and, being determined, closes his mouth. The actions and
attitude of a helpless man are, in every one of these respects, exactly
the reverse. In Plate VI. we may imagine one of the figures on the left
side to have just said, "What do you mean by insulting me?" and one of
the figures on the right side to answer, "I really could not help it."
The helpless man unconsciously contracts the muscles of his forehead
which are antagonistic to those that cause a frown, and thus raises his
eyebrows; at the same time he relaxes the muscles about the mouth, so
that the lower jaw drops. The antithesis is complete in every detail,
not only in the movements of the features, but in the position of the
limbs and in the attitude of the whole body, as may be seen in the
accompanying plate. As the helpless or apologetic man often wishes to
show his state of mind, he then acts in a conspicuous or demonstrative
manner.

In accordance with the fact that squaring the elbows and clenching the
fists are gestures by no means universal with the men of all races,
when they feel indignant and are prepared to attack their enemy, so it
appears that a helpless or apologetic frame of mind is expressed in many
parts of the world by merely shrugging the shoulders, without turning
inwards the elbows and opening the hands. The man or child who is
obstinate, or one who is resigned to some great misfortune, has in
neither case any idea of resistance by active means; and he expresses
this state of mind, by simply keeping his shoulders raised; or he may
possibly fold his arms across his breast.

_Signs of affirmation or approval, and of negation or disapproval:
nodding and shaking the head_.--I was curious to ascertain how far
the common signs used by us in affirmation and negation were general
throughout the world. These signs are indeed to a certain extent
expressive of our feelings, as we give a vertical nod of approval with
a smile to our children, when we approve of their conduct; and shake
our heads laterally with a frown, when we disapprove. With infants, the
first act of denial consists in refusing food; and I repeatedly noticed
with my own infants, that they did so by withdrawing their heads
laterally from the breast, or from anything offered them in a spoon. In
accepting food and taking it into their mouths, they incline their heads
forwards. Since making these observations I have been informed that
the same idea had occurred to Charma.[1117] It deserves notice that in
accepting or taking food, there is only a single movement forward, and a
single nod implies an affirmation. On the other hand, in refusing food,
especially if it be pressed on them, children frequently move their
heads several times from side to side, as we do in shaking our heads
in negation. Moreover, in the case of refusal, the head is not rarely
thrown backwards, or the mouth is closed, so that these movements might
likewise come to serve as signs of negation. Mr. Wedgwood remarks on
this subject,[1118] that "when the voice is exerted with closed teeth
or lips, it produces the sound of the letter _n_ or _m_. Hence we
may account for the use of the particle _ne_ to signify negation, and
possibly also of the Greek mh in the same sense."

That these signs are innate or instinctive, at least with Anglo-Saxons,
is rendered highly probable by the blind and deaf Laura Bridgman
"constantly accompanying her _yes_ with the common affirmative nod, and
her _no_ with our negative shake of the head." Had not Mr. Lieber stated
to the contrary,[1119] I should have imagined that these gestures might
have been acquired or learnt by her, considering her wonderful sense of
touch and appreciation of the movements of others. With microcephalous
idiots, who are so degraded that they never learn to speak, one of them
is described by Vogt,[1120] as answering, when asked whether he wished
for more food or drink, by inclining or shaking his head. Schmalz, in
his remarkable dissertation on the education of the deaf and dumb, as
well as of children raised only one degree above idiotcy, assumes that
they can always both make and understand the common signs of affirmation
and negation.

Nevertheless if we look to the various races of man, these signs are
not so universally employed as I should have expected; yet they seem
too general to be ranked as altogether conventional or artificial. My
informants assert that both signs are used by the Malays, by the natives
of Ceylon, the Chinese, the negroes of the Guinea coast, and, according
to Gaika, by the Kafirs of South Africa, though with these latter people
Mrs. Barber has never seen a lateral shake used as a negative. With
respect to the Australians, seven observers agree that a nod is given in
affirmation; five agree about a lateral shake in negation, accompanied
or not by some word; but Mr. Dyson Lacy has never seen this latter sign
in Queensland, and Mr. Bulmer says that in Gipps' Land a negative is
expressed by throwing the head a little backwards and putting out the
tongue. At the northern extremity of the continent, near Torres Straits,
the natives when uttering a negative "don't shake the head with it, but
holding up the right hand, shake it by turning it half round and back
again two or three times."[1122] The throwing back of the head with
a cluck of the tongue is said to be used as a negative by the modern
Greeks and Turks, the latter people expressing _yes_ by a movement like
that made by us when we shake our heads.[1123] The Abyssinians, as I am
informed by Captain Speedy, express a negative by jerking the head
to the right shoulder, together with a slight cluck, the mouth being
closed; an affirmation is expressed by the head being thrown backwards
and the eyebrows raised for an instant. The Tagals of Luzon, in the
Philippine Archipelago, as I hear from Dr. Adolf Meyer, when they say
"yes," also throw the head backwards. According to the Rajah Brooke, the
Dyaks of Borneo express an affirmation by raising the eyebrows, and a
negation by slightly contracting them, together with a peculiar look
from the eyes. With the Arabs on the Nile, Professor and Mrs. Asa Gray
concluded that nodding in affirmation was rare, whilst shaking the head
in negation was never used, and was not even understood by them.
With the Esquimaux[1124] a nod means _yes_ and a wink _no_. The
New Zealanders "elevate the head and chin in place of nodding
acquiescence."[1125]

With the Hindoos Mr. H. Erskine concludes from inquiries made from
experienced Europeans, and from native gentlemen, that the signs of
affirmation and negation vary--a nod and a lateral shake being sometimes
used as we do; but a negative is more commonly expressed by the head
being thrown suddenly backwards and a little to one side, with a cluck
of the tongue. What the meaning may be of this cluck of the tongue,
which has been observed with various people, I cannot imagine. A native
gentleman stated that affirmation is frequently shown by the head being
thrown to the left. I asked Mr. Scott to attend particularly to this
point, and, after repeated observations, he believes that a vertical nod
is not commonly used by the natives in affirmation, but that the head
is first thrown backwards either to the left or right, and then jerked
obliquely forwards only once. This movement would perhaps have been
described by a less careful observer as a lateral shake. He also states
that in negation the head is usually held nearly upright, and shaken
several times.

Mr. Bridges informs me that the Fuegians nod their heads vertically in
affirmation, and shake them laterally in denial. With the wild Indians
of North America, according to Mr. Washington Matthews, nodding and
shaking the head have been learnt from Europeans, and are not naturally
employed. They express affirmation by describing with the hand (all the
fingers except the index being flexed) a curve downwards and outwards
from the body, whilst negation is expressed by moving the open hand
outwards, with the palm facing inwards. Other observers state that the
sign of affirmation with these Indians is the forefinger being raised,
and then lowered and pointed to the ground, or the hand is waved
straight forward from the face; and that the sign of negation is
the finger or whole hand shaken from side to side.[1126] This latter
movement probably represents in all cases the lateral shaking of the
head. The Italians are said in like manner to move the lifted finger
from right to left in negation, as indeed we English sometimes do.

On the whole we find considerable diversity in the signs of affirmation
and negation in the different races of man. With respect to negation,
if we admit that the shaking of the finger or hand from side to side is
symbolic of the lateral movement of the head; and if we admit that the
sudden backward movement of the head represents one of the actions
often practised by young children in refusing food, then there is much
uniformity throughout the world in the signs of negation, and we can
see how they originated. The most marked exceptions are presented by the
Arabs, Esquimaux, some Australian tribes, and Dyaks. With the latter a
frown is the sign of negation, and with us frowning often accompanies a
lateral shake of the head.

With respect to nodding in affirmation, the exceptions are rather more
numerous, namely with some of the Hindoos, with the Turks, Abyssinians,
Dyaks, Tagals, and New Zealanders. The eyebrows are sometimes raised in
affirmation, and as a person in bending his head forwards and downwards
naturally looks up to the person whom he addresses, he will be apt
to raise his eyebrows, and this sign may thus have arisen as an
abbreviation. So again with the New Zealanders, the lifting up the chin
and head in affirmation may perhaps represent in an abbreviated form
the upward movement of the head after it has been nodded forwards and
downwards.



CHAPTER XII. -- SURPRISE--ASTONISHMENT--FEAR--HORROR.

Surprise, astonishment--Elevation of the eyebrows--Opening
the mouth--Protrusion of the lips--Gestures accompanying
surprise--Admiration--Fear--Terror--Erection of the hair--Contraction of
the platysma muscle--Dilatation of the pupils--Horror--Conclusion.


ATTENTION, if sudden and close, graduates into surprise; and this into
astonishment; and this into stupefied amazement. The latter frame of
mind is closely akin to terror. Attention is shown by the eyebrows being
slightly raised; and as this state increases into surprise, they are
raised to a much greater extent, with the eyes and mouth widely open.
The raising of the eyebrows is necessary in order that the eyes should
be opened quickly and widely; and this movement produces transverse
wrinkles across the forehead. The degree to which the eyes and mouth are
opened corresponds with the degree of surprise felt; but these movements
must be coordinated; for a widely opened mouth with eyebrows only
slightly raised results in a meaningless grimace, as Dr. Duchenne has
shown in one of his photographs.[1201] On the other hand, a person may
often be seen to pretend surprise by merely raising his eyebrows.

Dr. Duchenne has given a photograph of an old man with his eyebrows well
elevated and arched by the galvanization of the frontal muscle; and with
his mouth voluntarily opened. This figure expresses surprise with much
truth. I showed it to twenty-four persons without a word of explanation,
and one alone did not at all understand what was intended. A second
person answered terror, which is not far wrong; some of the others,
however, added to the words surprise or astonishment, the epithets
horrified, woful, painful, or disgusted.

The eyes and mouth being widely open is an expression universally
recognized as one of surprise or astonishment. Thus Shakespeare says,
"I saw a smith stand with open mouth swallowing a tailor's news." ('King
John,' act iv. scene ii.) And again, "They seemed almost, with staring
on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes; there was speech in the
dumbness, language in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
of a world destroyed." ('Winter's Tale,' act v. scene ii.)

My informants answer with remarkable uniformity to the same effect, with
respect to the various races of man; the above movements of the features
being often accompanied by certain gestures and sounds, presently to
be described. Twelve observers in different parts of Australia agree
on this head. Mr. Winwood Reade has observed this expression with the
negroes on the Guinea coast. The chief Gaika and others answer _yes_ to
my query with respect to the Kafirs of South Africa; and so do others
emphatically with reference to the Abyssinians, Ceylonese, Chinese,
Fuegians, various tribes of North America, and New Zealanders. With the
latter, Mr. Stack states that the expression is more plainly shown by
certain individuals than by others, though all endeavour as much as
possible to conceal their feelings. The Dyaks of Borneo are said by the
Rajah Brooke to open their eyes widely, when astonished, often swinging
their heads to and fro, and beating their breasts. Mr. Scott informs me
that the workmen in the Botanic Gardens at Calcutta are strictly ordered
not to smoke; but they often disobey this order, and when suddenly
surprised in the act, they first open their eyes and mouths widely.
They then often slightly shrug their shoulders, as they perceive that
discovery is inevitable, or frown and stamp on the ground from vexation.
Soon they recover from their surprise, and abject fear is exhibited by
the relaxation of all their muscles; their heads seem to sink between
their shoulders; their fallen eyes wander to and fro; and they
supplicate forgiveness.

The well-known Australian explorer, Mr. Stuart, has given[1202] a
striking account of stupefied amazement together with terror in a native
who had never before seen a man on horseback. Mr. Stuart approached
unseen and called to him from a little distance. "He turned round and
saw me. What he imagined I was I do not know; but a finer picture of
fear and astonishment I never saw. He stood incapable of moving a
limb, riveted to the spot, mouth open and eyes staring.... He remained
motionless until our black got within a few yards of him, when suddenly
throwing down his waddies, he jumped into a mulga bush as high as he
could get." He could not speak, and answered not a word to the inquiries
made by the black, but, trembling from head to foot, "waved with his
hand for us to be off."

That the eyebrows are raised by an innate or instinctive impulse may
be inferred from the fact that Laura Bridgman invariably acts thus when
astonished, as I have been assured by the lady who has lately had charge
of her. As surprise is excited by something unexpected or unknown, we
naturally desire, when startled, to perceive the cause as quickly as
possible; and we consequently open our eyes fully, so that the field of
vision may be increased, and the eyeballs moved easily in any direction.
But this hardly accounts for the eyebrows being so greatly raised as
is the case, and for the wild staring of the open eyes. The explanation
lies, I believe, in the impossibility of opening the eyes with great
rapidity by merely raising the upper lids. To effect this the eyebrows
must be lifted energetically. Any one who will try to open his eyes as
quickly as possible before a mirror will find that he acts thus; and the
energetic lifting up of the eyebrows opens the eyes so widely that
they stare, the white being exposed all round the iris. Moreover, the
elevation of the eyebrows is an advantage in looking upwards; for as
long as they are lowered they impede our vision in this direction.
Sir C. Bell gives[1203] a curious little proof of the part which the
eyebrows play in opening the eyelids. In a stupidly drunken man all the
muscles are relaxed, and the eyelids consequently droop, in the same
manner as when we are falling asleep. To counteract this tendency the
drunkard raises his eyebrows; and this gives to him a puzzled, foolish
look, as is well represented in one of Hogarth's drawings. The habit of
raising the eyebrows having once been gained in order to see as quickly
as possible all around us, the movement would follow from the force of
association whenever astonishment was felt from any cause, even from a
sudden sound or an idea.

With adult persons, when the eyebrows are raised, the whole forehead
becomes much wrinkled in transverse lines; but with children this occurs
only to a slight degree. The wrinkles run in lines concentric with each
eyebrow, and are partially confluent in the middle. They are highly
characteristic of the expression of surprise or astonishment. Each
eyebrow, when raised, becomes also, as Duchenne remarks,[1204] more
arched than it was before.

The cause of the mouth being opened when astonishment is felt, is a much
more complex affair; and several causes apparently concur in leading
to this movement. It has often been supposed[1205] that the sense
of hearing is thus rendered more acute; but I have watched persons
listening intently to a slight noise, the nature and source of which
they knew perfectly, and they did not open their mouths. Therefore I at
one time imagined that the open mouth might aid in distinguishing the
direction whence a sound proceeded, by giving another channel for its
entrance into the ear through the eustachian tube, But Dr. W. Ogle[1206]
has been so kind as to search the best recent authorities on the
functions of the eustachian tube, and he informs me that it is almost
conclusively proved that it remains closed except during the act of
deglutition; and that in persons in whom the tube remains abnormally
open, the sense of hearing, as far as external sounds are concerned, is
by no means improved; on the contrary, it is impaired by the respiratory
sounds being rendered more distinct. If a watch be placed within the
mouth, but not allowed to touch the sides, the ticking is heard much
less plainly than when held outside. In persons in whom from disease
or a cold the eustachian tube is permanently or temporarily closed,
the sense of hearing is injured; but this may be accounted for by mucus
accumulating within the tube, and the consequent exclusion of air. We
may therefore infer that the mouth is not kept open under the sense
of astonishment for the sake of hearing sounds more distinctly;
notwithstanding that most deaf people keep their mouths open.

Every sudden emotion, including astonishment, quickens the action of
the heart, and with it the respiration. Now we can breathe, as Gratiolet
remarks[1207] and as appears to me to be the case, much more quietly
through the open mouth than through the nostrils. Therefore, when we
wish to listen intently to any sound, we either stop breathing, or
breathe as quietly as possible, by opening our mouths, at the same time
keeping our bodies motionless. One of my sons was awakened in the night
by a noise under circumstances which naturally led to great care, and
after a few minutes he perceived that his mouth was widely open. He
then became conscious that he had opened it for the sake of breathing as
quietly as possible. This view receives support from the reversed case
which occurs with dogs. A dog when panting after exercise, or on a
hot day, breathes loudly; but if his attention be suddenly aroused,
he instantly pricks his ears to listen, shuts his mouth, and breathes
quietly, as he is enabled to do, through his nostrils.

When the attention is concentrated for a length of time with fixed
earnestness on any object or subject, all the organs of the body
are forgotten and neglected;[1208] and as the nervous energy of each
individual is limited in amount, little is transmitted to any part of
the system, excepting that which is at the time brought into energetic
action. Therefore many of the muscles tend to become relaxed, and the
jaw drops from its own weight. This will account for the dropping of the
jaw and open mouth of a man stupefied with amazement, and perhaps
when less strongly affected. I have noticed this appearance, as I
find recorded in my notes, in very young children when they were only
moderately surprised.

There is still another and highly effective cause, leading to the mouth
being opened, when we are astonished, and more especially when we are
suddenly startled. We can draw a full and deep inspiration much more
easily through the widely open mouth than through the nostrils. Now when
we start at any sudden sound or sight, almost all the muscles of the
body are involuntarily and momentarily thrown into strong action, for
the sake of guarding ourselves against or jumping away from the danger,
which we habitually associate with anything unexpected. But we always
unconsciously prepare ourselves for any great exertion, as formerly
explained, by first taking a deep and full inspiration, and we
consequently open our mouths. If no exertion follows, and we still
remain astonished, we cease for a time to breathe, or breathe as quietly
as possible, in order that every sound may be distinctly heard. Or
again, if our attention continues long and earnestly absorbed, all our
muscles become relaxed, and the jaw, which was at first suddenly opened,
remains dropped. Thus several causes concur towards this same movement,
whenever surprise, astonishment, or amazement is felt.

Although when thus affected, our mouths are generally opened, yet the
lips are often a little protruded. This fact reminds us of the
same movement, though in a much more strongly marked degree, in the
chimpanzee and orang when astonished. As a strong expiration naturally
follows the deep inspiration which accompanies the first sense of
startled surprise, and as the lips are often protruded, the various
sounds which are then commonly uttered can apparently be accounted for.
But sometimes a strong expiration alone is heard; thus Laura Bridgman,
when amazed, rounds and protrudes her lips, opens them, and breathes
strongly.[1209] One of the commonest sounds is a deep _Oh_; and this
would naturally follow, as explained by Helmholtz, from the mouth being
moderately opened and the lips protruded. On a quiet night some rockets
were fired from the 'Beagle,' in a little creek at Tahiti, to amuse the
natives; and as each rocket, was let off there was absolute silence,
but this was invariably followed by a deep groaning _Oh_, resounding
all round the bay. Mr. Washington Matthews says that the North American
Indians express astonishment by a groan; and the negroes on the West
Coast of Africa, according to Mr. Winwood Reade, protrude their lips,
and make a sound like _heigh, heigh_. If the mouth is not much opened,
whilst the lips are considerably protruded, a blowing, hissing, or
whistling noise is produced. Mr. R. Brough Smith informs me that an
Australian from the interior was taken to the theatre to see an acrobat
rapidly turning head over heels: "he was greatly astonished, and
protruded his lips, making a noise with his mouth as if blowing out a
match." According to Mr. Bulmer the Australians, when surprised, utter
the exclamation _korki_, "and to do this the mouth is drawn out as if
going to whistle." We Europeans often whistle as a sign of surprise;
thus, in a recent novel[1210] it is said, "here the man expressed his
astonishment and disapprobation by a prolonged whistle." A Kafir girl,
as Mr. J. Mansel Weale informs me, "on hearing of the high price of an
article, raised her eyebrows and whistled just as a European would." Mr.
Wedgwood remarks that such sounds are written down as _whew_, and they
serve as interjections for surprise.

According to three other observers, the Australians often evince
astonishment by a clucking noise. Europeans also sometimes express
gentle surprise by a little clicking noise of nearly the same kind. We
have seen that when we are startled, the mouth is suddenly opened; and
if the tongue happens to be then pressed closely against the palate, its
sudden withdrawal will produce a sound of this kind, which might thus
come to express surprise.

[Illustration: Gestures of the body. Plate VII]

Turning to gestures of the body. A surprised person often raises his
opened hands high above his head, or by bending his arms only to the
level of his face. The flat palms are directed towards the person who
causes this feeling, and the straightened fingers are separated. This
gesture is represented by Mr. Rejlander in Plate VII. fig. 1. In the
'Last Supper,' by Leonardo da Vinci, two of the Apostles have their
hands half uplifted, clearly expressive of their astonishment. A
trustworthy observer told me that he had lately met his wife under most
unexpected circumstances: "She started, opened her mouth and eyes very
widely, and threw up both her arms above her head." Several years ago
I was surprised by seeing several of my young children earnestly doing
something together on the ground; but the distance was too great for
me to ask what they were about. Therefore I threw up my open hands with
extended fingers above my head; and as soon as I had done this, I became
conscious of the action. I then waited, without saying a word, to see if
my children had understood this gesture; and as they came running to me
they cried out, "We saw that you were astonished at us." I do not
know whether this gesture is common to the various races of man, as I
neglected to make inquiries on this head. That it is innate or natural
may be inferred from the fact that Laura Bridgman, when amazed, "spreads
her arms and turns her hands with extended fingers upwards;"[1211] nor
is it likely, considering that the feeling of surprise is generally a
brief one, that she should have learnt this gesture through her keen
sense of touch.

Huschke describes[1212] a somewhat different yet allied gesture, which
he says is exhibited by persons when astonished. They hold themselves
erect, with the features as before described, but with the straightened
arms extended backwards--the stretched fingers being separated from each
other. I have never myself seen this gesture; but Huschke is probably
correct; for a friend asked another man how he would express great
astonishment, and he at once threw himself into this attitude.

These gestures are, I believe, explicable on the principle of
antithesis. We have seen that an indignant man holds his head erect,
squares his shoulders, turns out his elbows, often clenches his fist,
frowns, and closes his mouth; whilst the attitude of a helpless man is
in every one of these details the reverse. Now, a man in an ordinary
frame of mind, doing nothing and thinking of nothing in particular,
usually keeps his two arms suspended laxly by his sides, with his hands
somewhat flexed, and the fingers near together. Therefore, to raise the
arms suddenly, either the whole arms or the fore-arms, to open the palms
flat, and to separate the fingers,--or, again, to straighten the arms,
extending them backwards with separated fingers,--are movements in
complete antithesis to those preserved under an indifferent frame
of mind, and they are, in consequence, unconsciously assumed by an
astonished man. There is, also, often a desire to display surprise in
a conspicuous manner, and the above attitudes are well fitted for this
purpose. It may be asked why should surprise, and only a few other
states of the mind, be exhibited by movements in antithesis to others.
But this principle will not be brought into play in the case of those
emotions, such as terror, great joy, suffering, or rage, which naturally
lead to certain lines of action and produce certain effects on the body,
for the whole system is thus preoccupied; and these emotions are already
thus expressed with the greatest plainness.

There is another little gesture, expressive of astonishment of which I
can offer no explanation; namely, the hand being placed over the mouth
or on some part of the head. This has been observed with so many races
of man, that it must have some natural origin. A wild Australian was
taken into a large room full of official papers, which surprised him
greatly, and he cried out, _cluck, cluck, cluck_, putting the back of
his hand towards his lips. Mrs. Barber says that the Kafirs and Fingoes
express astonishment by a serious look and by placing the right hand
upon the mouth, Littering the word _mawo_, which means 'wonderful.' The
Bushmen are said[1213] to put their right hands to their necks, bending
their heads backwards. Mr. Winwood Reade has observed that the negroes
on the West Coast of Africa, when surprised, clap their hands to their
mouths, saying at the same time, "My mouth cleaves to me," i. e. to
my hands; and he has heard that this is their usual gesture on such
occasions. Captain Speedy informs me that the Abyssinians place
their right hand to the forehead, with the palm outside. Lastly, Mr.
Washington Matthews states that the conventional sign of astonishment
with the wild tribes of the western parts of the United States "is made
by placing the half-closed hand over the mouth; in doing this, the head
is often bent forwards, and words or low groans are sometimes uttered."
Catlin[1214] makes the same remark about the hand being pressed over the
mouth by the Mandans and other Indian tribes.


_Admiration_.--Little need be said on this head. Admiration apparently
consists of surprise associated with some pleasure and a sense of
approval. When vividly felt, the eyes are opened and the eyebrows
raised; the eyes become bright, instead of remaining blank, as under
simple astonishment; and the mouth, instead of gaping open, expands into
a smile.


_Fear, Terror_.--The word 'fear' seems to be derived from what is sudden
and dangerous;[1215] and that of terror from the trembling of the vocal
organs and body. I use the word 'terror' for extreme fear; but some
writers think it ought to be confined to cases in which the imagination
is more particularly concerned. Fear is often preceded by astonishment,
and is so far akin to it, that both lead to the senses of sight and
hearing being instantly aroused. In both cases the eyes and mouth are
widely opened, and the eyebrows raised. The frightened man at first
stands like a statue motionless and breathless, or crouches down as if
instinctively to escape observation.

The heart beats quickly and violently, so that it palpitates or knocks
against the ribs; but it is very doubtful whether it then works more
efficiently than usual, so as to send a greater supply of blood to
all parts of the body; for the skin instantly becomes pale, as during
incipient faintness. This paleness of the surface, however, is probably
in large part, or exclusively, due to the vasomotor centre being
affected in such a manner as to cause the contraction of the small
arteries of the skin. That the skin is much affected under the sense of
great fear, we see in the marvellous and inexplicable manner in which
perspiration immediately exudes from it. This exudation is all the
more remarkable, as the surface is then cold, and hence the term a cold
sweat; whereas, the sudorific glands are properly excited into action
when the surface is heated. The hairs also on the skin stand erect; and
the superficial muscles shiver. In connection with the disturbed
action of the heart, the breathing is hurried. The salivary glands act
imperfectly; the mouth becomes dry,[1216] and is often opened and shut.
I have also noticed that under slight fear there is a strong tendency
to yawn. One of the best-marked symptoms is the trembling of all the
muscles of the body; and this is often first seen in the lips. From this
cause, and from the dryness of the mouth, the voice becomes husky or
indistinct, or may altogether fail. "Obstupui, steteruntque comae, et
vox faucibus haesit."

Of vague fear there is a well-known and grand description in Job:--"In
thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. Then
a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up. It stood
still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before my
eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, Shall mortal man
be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?" (Job
iv. 13)

As fear increases into an agony of terror, we behold, as under all
violent emotions, diversified results. The heart beats wildly, or may
fail to act and faintness ensue; there is a death-like pallor; the
breathing is laboured; the wings of the nostrils are wildly dilated;
"there is a gasping and convulsive motion of the lips, a tremor on the
hollow cheek, a gulping and catching of the throat;"[1217] the uncovered
and protruding eyeballs are fixed on the object of terror; or they may
roll restlessly from side to side, _huc illuc volvens oculos totumque
pererrat_.[1218] The pupils are said to be enormously dilated. All the
muscles of the body may become rigid, or may be thrown into convulsive
movements. The hands are alternately clenched and opened, often with
a twitching movement. The arms may be protruded, as if to avert some
dreadful danger, or may be thrown wildly over the head. The Rev. Mr.
Hagenauer has seen this latter action in a terrified Australian. In
other cases there is a sudden and uncontrollable tendency to headlong
flight; and so strong is this, that the boldest soldiers may be seized
with a sudden panic.

As fear rises to an extreme pitch, the dreadful scream of terror is
heard. Great beads of sweat stand on the skin. All the muscles of the
body are relaxed. Utter prostration soon follows, and the mental powers
fail. The intestines are affected. The sphincter muscles cease to act,
and no longer retain the contents of the body.

[Illustration: Photograph of an insane woman. Fig. 19]

Dr. J. Crichton Browne has given me so striking an account of intense
fear in an insane woman, aged thirty-five, that the description though
painful ought not to be omitted. When a paroxysm seizes her, she screams
out, "This is hell!" "There is a black woman!" "I can't get out!"--and
other such exclamations. When thus screaming, her movements are those
of alternate tension and tremor. For one instant she clenches her hands,
holds her arms out before her in a stiff semi-flexed position; then
suddenly bends her body forwards, sways rapidly to and fro, draws her
fingers through her hair, clutches at her neck, and tries to tear off
her clothes. The sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles (which serve to bend the
head on the chest) stand out prominently, as if swollen, and the skin in
front of them is much wrinkled. Her hair, which is cut short at the back
of her head, and is smooth when she is calm, now stands on end; that in
front being dishevelled by the movements of her hands. The countenance
expresses great mental agony. The skin is flushed over the face and
neck, down to the clavicles, and the veins of the forehead and neck
stand out like thick cords. The lower lip drops, and is somewhat
everted. The mouth is kept half open, with the lower jaw projecting. The
cheeks are hollow and deeply furrowed in curved lines running from
the wings of the nostrils to the corners of the mouth. The nostrils
themselves are raised and extended. The eyes are widely opened, and
beneath them the skin appears swollen; the pupils are large. The
forehead is wrinkled transversely in many folds, and at the inner
extremities of the eyebrows it is strongly furrowed in diverging lines,
produced by the powerful and persistent contraction of the corrugators.

[Illustration: Terror. Fig. 20]

Mr. Bell has also described[1219] an agony of terror and of despair,
which he witnessed in a murderer, whilst carried to the place of
execution in Turin. "On each side of the car the officiating priests
were seated; and in the centre sat the criminal himself. It was
impossible to witness the condition of this unhappy wretch without
terror; and yet, as if impelled by some strange infatuation, it was
equally impossible not to gaze upon an object so wild, so full of
horror. He seemed about thirty-five years of age; of large and muscular
form; his countenance marked by strong and savage features; half naked,
pale as death, agonized with terror, every limb strained in anguish,
his hands clenched convulsively, the sweat breaking out on his bent
and contracted brow, he kissed incessantly the figure of our Saviour,
painted on the flag which was suspended before him; but with an agony of
wildness and despair, of which nothing ever exhibited on the stage can
give the slightest conception."

I will add only one other case, illustrative of a man utterly prostrated
by terror. An atrocious murderer of two persons was brought into a
hospital, under the mistaken impression that he had poisoned himself;
and Dr. W. Ogle carefully watched him the next morning, while he was
being handcuffed and taken away by the police. His pallor was extreme,
and his prostration so great that he was hardly able to dress himself.
His skin perspired; and his eyelids and head drooped so much that it was
impossible to catch even a glimpse of his eyes. His lower jaw hung down.
There was no contraction of any facial muscle, and Dr. Ogle is almost
certain that the hair did not stand on end, for he observed it narrowly,
as it had been dyed for the sake of concealment.

With respect to fear, as exhibited by the various races of man, my
informants agree that the signs are the same as with Europeans. They
are displayed in an exaggerated degree with the Hindoos and natives of
Ceylon. Mr. Geach has seen Malays when terrified turn pale and shake;
and Mr. Brough Smyth states that a native Australian "being on one
occasion much frightened, showed a complexion as nearly approaching to
what we call paleness, as can well be conceived in the case of a very
black man." Mr. Dyson Lacy has seen extreme fear shown in an Australian,
by a nervous twitching of the hands, feet, and lips; and by the
perspiration standing on the skin. Many savages do not repress the signs
of fear so much as Europeans; and they often tremble greatly. With the
Kafir, Gaika says, in his rather quaint English, the shaking "of the
body is much experienced, and the eyes are widely open." With savages,
the sphincter muscles are often relaxed, just as may be observed in much
frightened dogs, and as I have seen with monkeys when terrified by being
caught.


_The erection of the hair_.--Some of the signs of fear deserve a little
further consideration. Poets continually speak of the hair standing on
end; Brutus says to the ghost of Caesar, "that mak'st my blood cold, and
my hair to stare." And Cardinal Beaufort, after the murder of Gloucester
exclaims, "Comb down his hair; look, look, it stands upright." As I did
not feel sure whether writers of fiction might not have applied to man
what they had often observed in animals, I begged for information from
Dr. Crichton Browne with respect to the insane. He states in answer that
he has repeatedly seen their hair erected under the influence of sudden
and extreme terror. For instance, it is occasionally necessary to inject
morphia, under the skin of an insane woman, who dreads the operation
extremely, though it causes very little pain; for she believes that
poison is being introduced into her system, and that her bones will be
softened, and her flesh turned into dust. She becomes deadly pale;
her limbs are stiffened by a sort of tetanic spasm, and her hair is
partially erected on the front of the head.

Dr. Browne further remarks that the bristling of the hair which is
so common in the insane, is not always associated with terror. It is
perhaps most frequently seen in chronic maniacs, who rave incoherently
and have destructive impulses; but it is during their paroxysms of
violence that the bristling is most observable. The fact of the
hair becoming erect under the influence both of rage and fear agrees
perfectly with what we have seen in the lower animals. Dr. Browne
adduces several cases in evidence. Thus with a man now in the Asylum,
before the recurrence of each maniacal paroxysm, "the hair rises up
from his forehead like the mane of a Shetland pony." He has sent
me photographs of two women, taken in the intervals between their
paroxysms, and he adds with respect to one of these women, "that the
state of her hair is a sure and convenient criterion of her mental
condition." I have had one of these photographs copied, and the
engraving gives, if viewed from a little distance, a faithful
representation of the original, with the exception that the hair appears
rather too coarse and too much curled. The extraordinary condition of
the hair in the insane is due, not only to its erection, but to its
dryness and harshness, consequent on the subcutaneous glands failing
to act. Dr. Bucknill has said[1220] that a lunatic "is a lunatic to his
finger's ends;" he might have added, and often to the extremity of each
particular hair.

Dr. Browne mentions as an empirical confirmation of the relation which
exists in the insane between the state of their hair and minds, that
the wife of a medical man, who has charge of a lady suffering from acute
melancholia, with a strong fear of death, for herself, her husband and
children, reported verbally to him the day before receiving my letter as
follows, "I think Mrs. ---- will soon improve, for her hair is getting
smooth; and I always notice that our patients get better whenever their
hair ceases to be rough and unmanageable."

Dr. Browne attributes the persistently rough condition of the hair
in many insane patients, in part to their minds being always somewhat
disturbed, and in part to the effects of habit,--that is, to the hair
being frequently and strongly erected during their many recurrent
paroxysms. In patients in whom the bristling of the hair is extreme, the
disease is generally permanent and mortal; but in others, in whom the
bristling is moderate, as soon as they recover their health of mind the
hair recovers its smoothness.

In a previous chapter we have seen that with animals the hairs are
erected by the contraction of minute, unstriped, and involuntary
muscles, which run to each separate follicle. In addition to this
action, Mr. J. Wood has clearly ascertained by experiment, as he
informs me, that with man the hairs on the front of the head which slope
forwards, and those on the back which slope backwards, are raised in
opposite directions by the contraction of the occipito-frontalis or
scalp muscle. So that this muscle seems to aid in the erection of
the hairs on the head of man in the same manner as the homologous
_panniculus carnosus_ aids, or takes the greater part, in the erection
of the spines on the backs of some of the lower animals.


_Contraction of the platysma myoides muscle_.--This muscle is spread
over the sides of the neck, extending downwards to a little beneath the
collar-bones, and upwards to the lower part of the cheeks. A portion,
called the risorius, is represented in the woodcut (M) fig. 2. The
contraction of this muscle draws the corners of the mouth and the lower
parts of the checks downwards and backwards. It produces at the same
time divergent, longitudinal, prominent ridges on the sides of the neck
in the young; and, in old thin persons, fine transverse wrinkles. This
muscle is sometimes said not to be under the control of the will; but
almost every one, if told to draw the corners of his mouth backwards
and downwards with great force, brings it into action. I have, however,
heard of a man who can voluntarily act on it only on one side of his
neck.

Sir C. Bell[1221] and others have stated that this muscle is strongly
contracted under the influence of fear; and Duchenne insists so strongly
on its importance in the expression of this emotion, that he calls it
the _muscle of fright_.[1222] He admits, however, that its contraction
is quite inexpressive unless associated with widely open eyes and
mouth. He has given a photograph (copied and reduced in the accompanying
woodcut) of the same old man as on former occasions, with his eyebrows
strongly raised, his mouth opened, and the platysma contracted, all by
means of galvanism. The original photograph was shown to twenty-four
persons, and they were separately asked, without any explanation being
given, what expression was intended: twenty instantly answered, "intense
fright" or "horror"; three said pain, and one extreme discomfort. Dr.
Duchenne has given another photograph of the same old man, with the
platysma contracted, the eyes and mouth opened, and the eyebrows
rendered oblique, by means of galvanism. The expression thus induced
is very striking (see Plate VII. fig. 2); the obliquity of the eyebrows
adding the appearance of great mental distress. The original was shown
to fifteen persons; twelve answered terror or horror, and three agony or
great suffering. From these cases, and from an examination of the other
photographs given by Dr. Duchenne, together with his remarks thereon,
I think there can be little doubt that the contraction of the platysma
does add greatly to the expression of fear. Nevertheless this muscle
ought hardly to be called that of fright, for its contraction is
certainly not a necessary concomitant of this state of mind.

A man may exhibit extreme terror in the plainest manner by death-like
pallor, by drops of perspiration on his skin, and by utter prostration,
with all the muscles of his body, including the platysma, completely
relaxed. Although Dr. Browne has often seen this muscle quivering and
contracting in the insane, he has not been able to connect its action
with any emotional condition in them, though he carefully attended to
patients suffering from great fear. Mr. Nicol, on the other hand, has
observed three cases in which this muscle appeared to be more or less
permanently contracted under the influence of melancholia, associated
with much dread; but in one of these cases, various other muscles about
the neck and head were subject to spasmodic contractions.

Dr. W. Ogle observed for me in one of the London hospitals about twenty
patients, just before they were put under the influence of chloroform
for operations. They exhibited some trepidation, but no great terror. In
only four of the cases was the platysma visibly contracted; and it did
not begin to contract until the patients began to cry. The muscle seemed
to contract at the moment of each deep-drawn inspiration; so that it is
very doubtful whether the contraction depended at all on the emotion of
fear. In a fifth case, the patient, who was not chloroformed, was
much terrified; and his platysma was more forcibly and persistently
contracted than in the other cases. But even here there is room for
doubt, for the muscle which appeared to be unusually developed, was seen
by Dr. Ogle to contract as the man moved his head from the pillow, after
the operation was over.

As I felt much perplexed why, in any case, a superficial muscle on
the neck should be especially affected by fear, I applied to my many
obliging correspondents for information about the contraction of this
muscle under other circumstances. It would be superfluous to give all
the answers which I have received. They show that this muscle acts,
often in a variable manner and degree, under many different conditions.
It is violently contracted in hydrophobia, and in a somewhat less degree
in lockjaw; sometimes in a marked manner during the insensibility from
chloroform. Dr. W. Ogle observed two male patients, suffering from such
difficulty in breathing, that the trachea had to be opened, and in both
the platysma was strongly contracted. One of these men overheard the
conversation of the surgeons surrounding him, and when he was able to
speak, declared that he had not been frightened. In some other cases
of extreme difficulty of respiration, though not requiring tracheotomy,
observed by Drs. Ogle and Langstaff, the platysma was not contracted.

Mr. J. Wood, who has studied with such care the muscles of the human
body, as shown by his various publications, has often seen the platysma
contracted in vomiting, nausea, and disgust; also in children and adults
under the influence of rage,--for instance, in Irishwomen, quarrelling
and brawling together with angry gesticulations. This may possibly have
been due to their high and angry tones; for I know a lady, an excellent
musician, who, in singing certain high notes, always contracts her
platysma. So does a young man, as I have observed, in sounding certain
notes on the flute. Mr. J. Wood informs me that he has found the
platysma best developed in persons with thick necks and broad shoulders;
and that in families inheriting these peculiarities, its development
is usually associated with much voluntary power over the homologous
occipito-frontalis muscle, by which the scalp can be moved.

None of the foregoing cases appear to throw any light on the contraction
of the platysma from fear; but it is different, I think, with the
following cases. The gentleman before referred to, who can voluntarily
act on this muscle only on one side of his neck, is positive that it
contracts on both sides whenever he is startled. Evidence has already
been given showing that this muscle sometimes contracts, perhaps for
the sake of opening the mouth widely, when the breathing is rendered
difficult by disease, and during the deep inspirations of crying-fits
before an operation. Now, whenever a person starts at any sudden
sight or sound, he instantaneously draws a deep breath; and thus the
contraction of the platysma may possibly have become associated with the
sense of fear. But there is, I believe, a more efficient relation.
The first sensation of fear, or the imagination of something dreadful,
commonly excites a shudder. I have caught myself giving a little
involuntary shudder at a painful thought, and I distinctly perceived
that my platysma contracted; so it does if I simulate a shudder. I have
asked others to act in this manner; and in some the muscle contracted,
but not in others. One of my sons, whilst getting out of bed, shuddered
from the cold, and, as he happened to have his hand on his neck, he
plainly felt that this muscle strongly contracted. He then voluntarily
shuddered, as he had done on former occasions, but the platysma was not
then affected. Mr. J. Wood has also several times observed this muscle
contracting in patients, when stripped for examination, and who were not
frightened, but shivered slightly from the cold. Unfortunately I have
not been able to ascertain whether, when the whole body shakes, as
in the cold stage of an ague fit, the platysma contracts. But as it
certainly often contracts during a shudder; and as a shudder or shiver
often accompanies the first sensation of fear, we have, I think, a clue
to its action in this latter case.[1223] Its contraction, however, is
not an invariable concomitant of fear; for it probably never acts under
the influence of extreme, prostrating terror.


_Dilatation of the Pupils_.--Gratiolet repeatedly insists[1224] that the
pupils are enormously dilated whenever terror is felt. I have no reason
to doubt the accuracy of this statement, but have failed to obtain
confirmatory evidence, excepting in the one instance before given of an
insane woman suffering from great fear. When writers of fiction speak of
the eyes being widely dilated, I presume that they refer to the eyelids.
Munro's statement, that with parrots the iris is affected by the
passions, independently of the amount of light, seems to bear on this
question; but Professor Donders informs me, that he has often seen
movements in the pupils of these birds which he thinks may be related to
their power of accommodation to distance, in nearly the same manner
as our own pupils contract when our eyes converge for near vision.
Gratiolet remarks that the dilated pupils appear as if they were gazing
into profound darkness. No doubt the fears of man have often been
excited in the dark; but hardly so often or so exclusively, as to
account for a fixed and associated habit having thus arisen. It seems
more probable, assuming that Gratiolet's statement is correct, that the
brain is directly affected by the powerful emotion of fear and reacts on
the pupils; but Professor Donders informs me that this is an extremely
complicated subject. I may add, as possibly throwing light on the
subject, that Dr. Fyffe, of Netley Hospital, has observed in two
patients that the pupils were distinctly dilated during the cold stage
of an ague fit. Professor Donders has also often seen dilatation of the
pupils in incipient faintness.


_Horror_.--The state of mind expressed by this term implies terror, and
is in some, cases almost synonymous with it. Many a man must have felt,
before the blessed discovery of chloroform, great horror at the thought
of an impending surgical operation. He who dreads, as well as hates a
man, will feel, as Milton uses the word, a horror of him. We feel horror
if we see any one, for instance a child, exposed to some instant and
crushing danger. Almost every one would experience the same feeling in
the highest degree in witnessing a man being tortured or going to be
tortured. In these cases there is no danger to ourselves; but from
the power of the imagination and of sympathy we put ourselves in the
position of the sufferer, and feel something akin to fear.

[Illustration: Horror and Agony. Fig. 21]

Sir C. Bell remarks,[1226] that "horror is full of energy; the body is
in the utmost tension, not unnerved by fear." It is, therefore, probable
that horror would generally be accompanied by the strong contraction of
the brows; but as fear is one of the elements, the eyes and mouth would
be opened, and the eyebrows would be raised, as far as the antagonistic
action of the corrugators permitted this movement. Duchenne has given a
photograph[1227] (fig. 21) of the same old man as before, with his eyes
somewhat staring, the eyebrows partially raised, and at the same time
strongly contracted, the mouth opened, and the platysma in action, all
effected by the means of galvanism. He considers that the expression
thus produced shows extreme terror with horrible pain or torture. A
tortured man, as long as his sufferings allowed him to feel any dread
for the future, would probably exhibit horror in an extreme degree. I
have shown the original of this photograph to twenty-three persons of
both sexes and various ages; and thirteen immediately answered horror,
great pain, torture, or agony; three answered extreme fright; so that
sixteen answered nearly in accordance with Duchenne's belief. Six,
however, said anger, guided no doubt, by the strongly contracted brows,
and overlooking the peculiarly opened mouth. One said disgust. On
the whole, the evidence indicates that we have here a fairly good
representation of horror and agony. The photograph before referred to
(Pl. VII. fig. 2) likewise exhibits horror; but in this the oblique
eyebrows indicate great mental distress in place of energy.

Horror is generally accompanied by various gestures, which differ in
different individuals. Judging from pictures, the whole body is often
turned away or shrinks; or the arms are violently protruded as if to
push away some dreadful object. The most frequent gesture, as far as
can be inferred from the action of persons who endeavour to express a
vividly-imagined scene of horror, is the raising of both shoulders,
with the bent arms pressed closely against the sides or chest. These
movements are nearly the same with those commonly made when we feel very
cold; and they are generally accompanied by a shudder, as well as by a
deep expiration or inspiration, according as the chest happens at the
time to be expanded or contracted. The sounds thus made are expressed by
words like _uh_ or _ugh_.[1228] It is not, however, obvious why, when we
feel cold or express a sense of horror, we press our bent arms against
our bodies, raise our shoulders, and shudder.


_Conclusion_.--I have now endeavoured to describe the diversified
expressions of fear, in its gradations from mere attention to a start
of surprise, into extreme terror and horror. Some of the signs may
be accounted for through the principles of habit, association, and
inheritance,--such as the wide opening of the mouth and eyes, with
upraised eyebrows, so as to see as quickly as possible all around us,
and to hear distinctly whatever sound may reach our ears. For we have
thus habitually prepared ourselves to discover and encounter any danger.
Some of the other signs of fear may likewise be accounted for, at
least in part, through these same principles. Men, during numberless
generations, have endeavoured to escape from their enemies or danger by
headlong flight, or by violently struggling with them; and such great
exertions will have caused the heart to beat rapidly, the breathing to
be hurried, the chest to heave, and the nostrils to be dilated. As these
exertions have often been prolonged to the last extremity, the final
result will have been utter prostration, pallor, perspiration, trembling
of all the muscles, or their complete relaxation. And now, whenever
the emotion of fear is strongly felt, though it may not lead to any
exertion, the same results tend to reappear, through the force of
inheritance and association.

Nevertheless, it is probable that many or most of the above symptoms of
terror, such as the beating of the heart, the trembling of the muscles,
cold perspiration, &c., are in large part directly due to the disturbed
or interrupted transmission of nerve-force from the cerebro-spinal
system to various parts of the body, owing to the mind being
so powerfully affected. We may confidently look to this cause,
independently of habit and association, in such cases as the modified
secretions of the intestinal canal, and the failure of certain glands to
act. With respect to the involuntary bristling of the hair, we have good
reason to believe that in the case of animals this action, however it
may have originated, serves, together with certain voluntary movements,
to make them appear terrible to their enemies; and as the same
involuntary and voluntary actions are performed by animals nearly
related to man, we are led to believe that man has retained through
inheritance a relic of them, now become useless. It is certainly a
remarkable fact, that the minute unstriped muscles, by which the hairs
thinly scattered over man's almost naked body are erected, should have
been preserved to the present day; and that they should still contract
under the same emotions, namely, terror and rage, which cause the hairs
to stand on end in the lower members of the Order to which man belongs.



CHAPTER XIII. -- SELF-ATTENTION--SHAME--SHYNESS--MODESTY: BLUSHING.

Nature of a blush--Inheritance--The parts of the body most
affected--Blushing in the various races of man--Accompanying
gestures--Confusion of mind--Causes of blushing--Self-attention,
the fundamental element--Shyness--Shame, from broken moral laws and
conventional rules--Modesty--Theory of blushing--Recapitulation.


BLUSHING is the most peculiar and the most human of all expressions.
Monkeys redden from passion, but it would require an overwhelming
amount of evidence to make us believe that any animal could blush.
The reddening of the face from a blush is due to the relaxation of the
muscular coats of the small arteries, by which the capillaries become
filled with blood; and this depends on the proper vaso-motor centre
being affected. No doubt if there be at the same time much mental
agitation, the general circulation will be affected; but it is not due
to the action of the heart that the network of minute vessels covering
the face becomes under a sense of shame gorged with blood. We can cause
laughing by tickling the skin, weeping or frowning by a blow, trembling
from the fear of pain, and so forth; but we cannot cause a blush, as Dr.
Burgess remarks,[1301] by any physical means,--that is by any action on
the body. It is the mind which must be affected. Blushing is not only
involuntary; but the wish to restrain it, by leading to self-attention
actually increases the tendency.

The young blush much more freely than the old, but not during
infancy,[1302] which is remarkable, as we know that infants at a very
early age redden from passion. I have received authentic accounts of two
little girls blushing at the ages of between two and three years; and
of another sensitive child, a year older, blushing, when reproved for
a fault. Many children, at a somewhat more advanced age blush in a
strongly marked manner. It appears that the mental powers of infants
are not as yet sufficiently developed to allow of their blushing. Hence,
also, it is that idiots rarely blush. Dr. Crichton Browne observed for
me those under his care, but never saw a genuine blush, though he has
seen their faces flash, apparently from joy, when food was placed before
them, and from anger. Nevertheless some, if not utterly degraded, are
capable of blushing. A microcephalous idiot, for instance, thirteen
years old, whose eyes brightened a little when he was pleased or amused,
has been described by Dr. Behn,[1303] as blushing and turning to one
side, when undressed for medical examination.

Women blush much more than men. It is rare to see an old man, but not
nearly so rare to see an old woman blushing. The blind do not escape.
Laura Bridgman, born in this condition, as well as completely deaf,
blushes.[1304] The Rev. R. H. Blair, Principal of the Worcester College,
informs me that three children born blind, out of seven or eight then
in the Asylum, are great blushers. The blind are not at first conscious
that they are observed, and it is a most important part of their
education, as Mr. Blair informs me, to impress this knowledge on their
minds; and the impression thus gained would greatly strengthen the
tendency to blush, by increasing the habit of self-attention.

The tendency to blush is inherited. Dr. Burgess gives the case[1305] of
a family consisting of a father, mother, and ten children, all of whom,
without exception, were prone to blush to a most painful degree. The
children were grown up; "and some of them were sent to travel in order
to wear away this diseased sensibility, but nothing was of the slightest
avail." Even peculiarities in blushing seem to be inherited. Sir James
Paget, whilst examining the spine of a girl, was struck at her singular
manner of blushing; a big splash of red appeared first on one cheek,
and then other splashes, variously scattered over the face and neck.
He subsequently asked the mother whether her daughter always blushed in
this peculiar manner; and was answered, "Yes, she takes after me." Sir
J. Paget then perceived that by asking this question he had caused the
mother to blush; and she exhibited the same peculiarity as her daughter.

In most cases the face, ears and neck are the sole parts which redden;
but many persons, whilst blushing intensely, feel that their whole
bodies grow hot and tingle; and this shows that the entire surface must
be in some manner affected. Blushes are said sometimes to commence on
the forehead, but more commonly on the cheeks, afterwards spreading to
the ears and neck.[1306] In two Albinos examined by Dr. Burgess, the
blushes commenced by a small circumscribed spot on the cheeks, over the
parotidean plexus of nerves, and then increased into a circle; between
this blushing circle and the blush on the neck there was an evident line
of demarcation; although both arose simultaneously. The retina, which
is naturally red in the Albino, invariably increased at the same time
in redness.[1307] Every one must have noticed how easily after one blush
fresh blushes chase each other over the face. Blushing is preceded by a
peculiar sensation in the skin. According to Dr. Burgess the reddening
of the skin is generally succeeded by a slight pallor, which shows
that the capillary vessels contract after dilating. In some rare cases
paleness instead of redness is caused under conditions which would
naturally induce a blush. For instance, a young lady told me that in a
large and crowded party she caught her hair so firmly on the button of a
passing servant, that it took some time before she could be extricated;
from her sensations she imagined that she had blushed crimson; but was
assured by a friend that she had turned extremely pale.

I was desirous to learn how far down the body blushes extend; and Sir J.
Paget, who necessarily has frequent opportunities for observation, has
kindly attended to this point for me during two or three years. He finds
that with women who blush intensely on the face, ears, and nape of neck,
the blush does not commonly extend any lower down the body. It is rare
to see it as low down as the collar-bones and shoulder-blades; and he
has never himself seen a single instance in which it extended below the
upper part of the chest. He has also noticed that blushes sometimes die
away downwards, not gradually and insensibly, but by irregular ruddy
blotches. Dr. Langstaff has likewise observed for me several women whose
bodies did not in the least redden while their faces were crimsoned with
blushes. With the insane, some of whom appear to be particularly liable
to blushing, Dr. J. Crichton Browne has several times seen the blush
extend as far down as the collar-bones, and in two instances to the
breasts. He gives me the case of a married woman, aged twenty-seven, who
suffered from epilepsy. On the morning after her arrival in the Asylum,
Dr. Browne, together with his assistants, visited her whilst she was in
bed. The moment that he approached, she blushed deeply over her cheeks
and temples; and the blush spread quickly to her ears. She was much
agitated and tremulous. He unfastened the collar of her chemise in order
to examine the state of her lungs; and then a brilliant blush rushed
over her chest, in an arched line over the upper third of each breast,
and extended downwards between the breasts nearly to the ensiform
cartilage of the sternum. This case is interesting, as the blush did
not thus extend downwards until it became intense by her attention
being drawn to this part of her person. As the examination proceeded she
became composed, and the blush disappeared; but on several subsequent
occasions the same phenomena were observed.

The foregoing facts show that, as a general rule, with English women,
blushing does not extend beneath the neck and upper part of the chest.
Nevertheless Sir J. Paget informs me that he has lately heard of a case,
on which he can fully rely, in which a little girl, shocked by what she
imagined to be an act of indelicacy, blushed all over her abdomen and
the upper parts of her legs. Moreau also[1308] relates, on the authority
of a celebrated painter, that the chest, shoulders, arms, and whole body
of a girl, who unwillingly consented to serve as a model, reddened when
she was first divested of her clothes.

It is a rather curious question why, in most cases the face, ears,
and neck alone redden, inasmuch as the whole surface of the body often
tingles and grows hot. This seems to depend, chiefly, on the face and
adjoining parts of the skin having been habitually exposed to the air,
light, and alternations of temperature, by which the small arteries not
only have acquired the habit of readily dilating and contracting, but
appear to have become unusually developed in comparison with other parts
of the surface.[1309] It is probably owing to this same cause, as M.
Moreau and Dr. Burgess have remarked, that the face is so liable to
redden under various circumstances, such as a fever-fit, ordinary heat,
violent exertion, anger, a slight blow, &c.; and on the other hand that
it is liable to grow pale from cold and fear, and to be discoloured
during pregnancy. The face is also particularly liable to be affected
by cutaneous complaints, by small-pox, erysipelas, &c. This view is
likewise supported by the fact that the men of certain races, who
habitually go nearly naked, often blush over their arms and chests and
even down to their waists. A lady, who is a great blusher, informs Dr.
Crichton Browne, that when she feels ashamed or is agitated, she blushes
over her face, neck, wrists, and hands,--that is, over all the exposed
portions of her skin. Nevertheless it may be doubted whether the
habitual exposure of the skin of the face and neck, and its consequent
power of reaction under stimulants of all kinds, is by itself sufficient
to account for the much greater tendency in English women of these parts
than of others to blush; for the hands are well supplied with nerves and
small vessels, and have been as much exposed to the air as the face or
neck, and yet the hands rarely blush. We shall presently see that the
attention of the mind having been directed much more frequently and
earnestly to the face than to any other part of the body, probably
affords a sufficient explanation.


_Blushing in the various races of man_.--The small vessels of the face
become filled with blood, from the emotion of shame, in almost all the
races of man, though in the very dark races no distinct change of
colour can be perceived. Blushing is evident in all the Aryan nations of
Europe, and to a certain extent with those of India. But Mr. Erskine has
never noticed that the necks of the Hindoos are decidedly affected. With
the Lepchas of Sikhim, Mr. Scott has often observed a faint blush on the
cheeks, base of the ears, and sides of the neck, accompanied by sunken
eyes and lowered head. This has occurred when he has detected them in
a falsehood, or has accused them of ingratitude. The pale, sallow
complexions of these men render a blush much more conspicuous than in
most of the other natives of India. With the latter, shame, or it may be
in part fear, is expressed, according to Mr. Scott, much more plainly
by the head being averted or bent down, with the eyes wavering or turned
askant, than by any change of colour in the skin.

The Semitic races blush freely, as might have been expected, from their
general similitude to the Aryans. Thus with the Jews, it is said in the
Book of Jeremiah (chap. vi. 15), "Nay, they were not at all ashamed,
neither could they blush." Mrs. Asa Gray saw an Arab managing his boat
clumsily on the Nile, and when laughed at by his companions, "he blushed
quite to the back of his neck." Lady Duff Gordon remarks that a young
Arab blushed on coming into her presence.[1310]

Mr. Swinhoe has seen the Chinese blushing, but he thinks it is rare; yet
they have the expression "to redden with shame." Mr. Geach informs
me that the Chinese settled in Malacca and the native Malays of the
interior both blush. Some of these people go nearly naked, and he
particularly attended to the downward extension of the blush. Omitting
the cases in which the face alone was seen to blush, Mr. Geach observed
that the face, arms, and breast of a Chinaman, aged 24 years, reddened
from shame; and with another Chinese, when asked why he had not done
his work in better style, the whole body was similarly affected. In two
Malays[1311] he saw the face, neck, breast, and arms blushing; and in a
third Malay (a Bugis) the blush extended down to the waist.

The Polynesians blush freely. The Rev. Mr. Stack has seen hundreds of
instances with the New Zealanders. The following case is worth giving,
as it relates to an old man who was unusually dark-coloured and partly
tattooed. After having let his land to an Englishman for a small yearly
rental, a strong passion seized him to buy a gig, which had lately
become the fashion with the Maoris. He consequently wished to draw all
the rent for four years from his tenant, and consulted Mr. Stack whether
he could do so. The man was old, clumsy, poor, and ragged, and the idea
of his driving himself about in his carriage for display amused Mr.
Stack so much that he could not help bursting out into a laugh; and then
"the old man blushed up to the roots of his hair." Forster says that
"you may easily distinguish a spreading blush" on the cheeks of the
fairest women in Tahiti.[1312] The natives also of several of the other
archipelagoes in the Pacific have been seen to blush.

Mr. Washington Matthews has often seen a blush on the faces of the young
squaws belonging to various wild Indian tribes of North America. At the
opposite extremity of the continent in Tierra del Fuego, the natives,
according to Mr. Bridges, "blush much, but chiefly in regard to women;
but they certainly blush also at their own personal appearance." This
latter statement agrees with what I remember of the Fuegian, Jemmy
Button, who blushed when he was quizzed about the care which he took in
polishing his shoes, and in otherwise adorning himself. With respect
to the Aymara Indians on the lofty plateaus of Bolivia, Mr. Forbes
says,[1313] that from the colour of their skins it is impossible that
their blushes should be as clearly visible as in the white races; still
under such circumstances as would raise a blush in us, "there can always
be seen the same expression of modesty or confusion; and even in the
dark, a rise of temperature of the skin of the face can be felt, exactly
as occurs in the European." With the Indians who inhabit the hot,
equable, and damp parts of South America, the skin apparently does
not answer to mental excitement so readily as with the natives of the
northern and southern parts of the continent, who have long been exposed
to great vicissitudes of climate; for Humboldt quotes without a protest
the sneer of the Spaniard, "How can those be trusted, who know not how
to blush?"[1314] Von Spix and Martius, in speaking of the aborigines of
Brazil, assert that they cannot properly be said to blush; "it was
only after long intercourse with the whites, and after receiving
some education, that we perceived in the Indians a change of colour
expressive of the emotions of their minds."[1315] It is, however,
incredible that the power of blushing could have thus originated; but
the habit of self-attention, consequent on their education and new
course of life, would have much increased any innate tendency to blush.

Several trustworthy observers have assured me that they have seen on the
faces of negroes an appearance resembling a blush, under circumstances
which would have excited one in us, though their skins were of an
ebony-black tint. Some describe it as blushing brown, but most say that
the blackness becomes more intense. An increased supply of blood in
the skin seems in some manner to increase its blackness; thus certain
exanthematous diseases cause the affected places in the negro to appear
blacker, instead of, as with us, redder.[1316] The skin, perhaps, from
being rendered more tense by the filling of the capillaries, would
reflect a somewhat different tint to what it did before. That the
capillaries of the face in the negro become filled with blood, under
the emotion of shame, we may feel confident; because a perfectly
characterized albino negress, described by Buffon,[1317] showed a
faint tinge of crimson on her cheeks when she exhibited herself naked.
Cicatrices of the skin remain for a long time white in the negro, and
Dr. Burgess, who had frequent opportunities of observing a scar of this
kind on the face of a negress, distinctly saw that it "invariably became
red whenever she was abruptly spoken to, or charged with any
trivial offence."[1318] The blush could be seen proceeding from the
circumference of the scar towards the middle, but it did not reach the
centre. Mulattoes are often great blushers, blush succeeding blush over
their faces. From these facts there can be no doubt that negroes blush,
although no redness is visible on the skin.

I am assured by Gaika and by Mrs. Barber that the Kafirs of South
Africa never blush; but this may only mean that no change of colour is
distinguishable. Gaika adds that under the circumstances which would
make a European blush, his countrymen "look ashamed to keep their heads
up."

It is asserted by four of my informants that the Australians, who are
almost as black as negroes, never blush. A fifth answers doubtfully,
remarking that only a very strong blush could be seen, on account of
the dirty state of their skins. Three observers state that they do
blush;[1319] Mr. S. Wilson adding that this is noticeable only under a
strong emotion, and when the skin is not too dark from long exposure and
want of cleanliness. Mr. Lang answers, "I have noticed that shame almost
always excites a blush, which frequently extends as low as the neck."
Shame is also shown, as he adds, "by the eyes being turned from side to
side." As Mr. Lang was a teacher in a native school, it is probable
that he chiefly observed children; and we know that they blush more than
adults. Mr. G. Taplin has seen half-castes blushing, and he says that
the aborigines have a word expressive of shame. Mr. Hagenauer, who is
one of those who has never observed the Australians to blush, says that
he has "seen them looking down to the ground on account of shame;" and
the missionary, Mr. Bulmer, remarks that though "I have not been able to
detect anything like shame in the adult aborigines, I have noticed
that the eyes of the children, when ashamed, present a restless, watery
appearance, as if they did not know where to look."

The facts now given are sufficient to show that blushing, whether or not
there is any change of colour, is common to most, probably to all, of
the races of man.

_Movements and gestures which accompany Blushing_.--Under a keen sense
of shame there is a strong desire for concealment.[1320] We turn away
the whole body, more especially the face, which we endeavour in some
manner to hide. An ashamed person can hardly endure to meet the gaze of
those present, so that he almost invariably casts down his eyes or looks
askant. As there generally exists at the same time a strong wish to
avoid the appearance of shame, a vain attempt is made to look direct
at the person who causes this feeling; and the antagonism between these
opposite tendencies leads to various restless movements in the eyes.
I have noticed two ladies who, whilst blushing, to which they are
very liable, have thus acquired, as it appears, the oddest trick of
incessantly blinking their eyelids with extraordinary rapidity.
An intense blush is sometimes accompanied by a slight effusion of
tears;[1321] and this, I presume, is due to the lacrymal glands
partaking of the increased supply of blood, which we know rushes into
the capillaries of the adjoining parts, including the retina.

Many writers, ancient and modern, have noticed the foregoing movements;
and it has already been shown that the aborigines in various parts of
the world often exhibit their shame by looking downwards or askant, or
by restless movements of their eyes. Ezra cries out (ch. ix. 6), "O,
my God! I am ashamed, and blush to lift up my head to thee, my God."
In Isaiah (ch. I. 6) we meet with the words, "I hid not my face from
shame." Seneca remarks (Epist. xi. 5) "that the Roman players hang down
their heads, fix their eyes on the ground and keep them lowered, but are
unable to blush in acting shame." According to Macrobius, who lived in
the filth century ('Saturnalia,' B. vii. C. 11), "Natural philosophers
assert that nature being moved by shame spreads the blood before herself
as a veil, as we see any one blushing often puts his hands before his
face." Shakspeare makes Marcus ('Titus Andronicus,' act ii, sc. 5) say
to his niece, "Ah! now thou turn'st away thy face for shame." A lady
informs me that she found in the Lock Hospital a girl whom she had
formerly known, and who had become a wretched castaway, and the poor
creature, when approached, hid her face under the bed-clothes, and could
not be persuaded to uncover it. We often see little children, when shy
or ashamed, turn away, and still standing up, bury their faces in their
mother's gown; or they throw themselves face downwards on her lap.


_Confusion of mind_.--Most persons, whilst blushing intensely, have
their mental powers confused. This is recognized in such common
expressions as "she was covered with confusion." Persons in
this condition lose their presence of mind, and utter singularly
inappropriate remarks. They are often much distressed, stammer, and
make awkward movements or strange grimaces. In certain cases involuntary
twitchings of some of the facial muscles may be observed. I have been
informed by a young lady, who blushes excessively, that at such times
she does not even know what she is saying. When it was suggested to her
that this might be due to her distress from the consciousness that her
blushing was noticed, she answered that this could not be the case, "as
she had sometimes felt quite as stupid when blushing at a thought in her
own room."

I will give an instance of the extreme disturbance of mind to which some
sensitive men are liable. A gentleman, on whom I can rely, assured
me that he had been an eye-witness of the following scene:--A small
dinner-party was given in honour of an extremely shy man, who, when
he rose to return thanks, rehearsed the speech, which he had evidently
learnt by heart, in absolute silence, and did not utter a single word;
but he acted as if he were speaking with much emphasis. His friends,
perceiving how the case stood, loudly applauded the imaginary bursts of
eloquence, whenever his gestures indicated a pause, and the man never
discovered that he had remained the whole time completely silent. On the
contrary, he afterwards remarked to my friend, with much satisfaction,
that he thought he had succeeded uncommonly well.

When a person is much ashamed or very shy, and blushes intensely, his
heart beats rapidly and his breathing is disturbed. This can hardly fail
to affect the circulation of the blood within the brain, and perhaps the
mental powers. It seems however doubtful, judging from the still more
powerful influence of anger and fear on the circulation, whether we can
thus satisfactorily account for the confused state of mind in persons
whilst blushing intensely.

The true explanation apparently lies in the intimate sympathy which
exists between the capillary circulation of the surface of the head and
face, and that of the brain. On applying to Dr. J. Crichton Browne for
information, he has given me various facts bearing on this subject.
When the sympathetic nerve is divided on one side of the head, the
capillaries on this side are relaxed and become filled with blood,
causing the skin to redden and to grow hot, and at the same time the
temperature within the cranium on the same side rises. Inflammation of
the membranes of the brain leads to the engorgement of the face, ears,
and eyes with blood. The first stage of an epileptic fit appears to
be the contraction of the vessels of the brain, and the first outward
manifestation is, an extreme pallor of countenance. Erysipelas of
the head commonly induces delirium. Even the relief given to a severe
headache by burning the skin with strong lotion, depends, I presume, on
the same principle.

Dr. Browne has often administered to his patients the vapour of the
nitrite of amyl,[1322] which has the singular property of causing vivid
redness of the face in from thirty to sixty seconds. This flushing
resembles blushing in almost every detail: it begins at several distinct
points on the face, and spreads till it involves the whole surface of
the head, neck, and front of the chest; but has been observed to extend
only in one case to the abdomen. The arteries in the retina become
enlarged; the eyes glisten, and in one instance there was a slight
effusion of tears. The patients are at first pleasantly stimulated,
but, as the flushing increases, they become confused and bewildered. One
woman to whom the vapour had often been administered asserted that, as
soon as she grew hot, she grew MUDDLED. With persons just commencing to
blush it appears, judging from their bright eyes and lively behaviour,
that their mental powers are somewhat stimulated. It is only when the
blushing is excessive that the mind grows confused. Therefore it would
seem that the capillaries of the face are affected, both during the
inhalation of the nitrite of amyl and during blushing, before that part
of the brain is affected on which the mental powers depend.

Conversely when the brain is primarily affected; the circulation of the
skin is so in a secondary manner. Dr. Browne has frequently observed,
as he informs me, scattered red blotches and mottlings on the chests
of epileptic patients. In these cases, when the skin on the thorax
or abdomen is gently rubbed with a pencil or other object, or, in
strongly-marked cases, is merely touched by the finger, the surface
becomes suffused in less than half a minute with bright red marks, which
spread to some distance on each side of the touched point, and persist
for several minutes. These are the _cerebral maculae_ of Trousseau; and
they indicate, as Dr. Browne remarks, a highly modified condition of the
cutaneous vascular system. If, then, there exists, as cannot be doubted,
an intimate sympathy between the capillary circulation in that part
of the brain on which our mental powers depend, and in the skin of the
face, it is not surprising that the moral causes which induce intense
blushing should likewise induce, independently of their own disturbing
influence, much confusion of mind.


_The Nature of the Mental States which induce Blushing_.--These consist
of shyness, shame, and modesty; the essential element in all being
self-attention. Many reasons can be assigned for believing that
originally self-attention directed to personal appearance, in relation
to the opinion of others, was the exciting cause; the same effect
being subsequently produced, through the force of association, by
self-attention in relation to moral conduct. It is not the simple act of
reflecting on our own appearance, but the thinking what others think
of us, which excites a blush. In absolute solitude the most sensitive
person would be quite indifferent about his appearance. We feel blame
or disapprobation more acutely than approbation; and consequently
depreciatory remarks or ridicule, whether of our appearance or conduct,
causes us to blush much more readily than does praise. But undoubtedly
praise and admiration are highly efficient: a pretty girl blushes when a
man gazes intently at her, though she may know perfectly well that he
is not depreciating her. Many children, as well as old and sensitive
persons blush, when they are much praised. Hereafter the question will
be discussed, how it has arisen that the consciousness that others are
attending to our personal appearance should have led to the capillaries,
especially those of the face, instantly becoming filled with blood.

My reasons for believing that attention directed to personal appearance,
and not to moral conduct, has been the fundamental element in the
acquirement of the habit of blushing, will now be given. They
are separately light, but combined possess, as it appears to me,
considerable weight. It is notorious that nothing makes a shy person
blush so much as any remark, however slight, on his personal appearance.
One cannot notice even the dress of a woman much given to blushing,
without causing her face to crimson. It is sufficient to stare hard at
some persons to make them, as Coleridge remarks, blush,--"account for
that he who can."[1323]

With the two albinos observed by Dr. Burgess,[1324] "the slightest
attempt to examine their peculiarities invariably caused them to blush
deeply." Women are much more sensitive about their personal appearance
than men are, especially elderly women in comparison with elderly men,
and they blush much more freely. The young of both sexes are much more
sensitive on this same head than the old, and they also blush much more
freely than the old. Children at a very early age do not blush; nor
do they show those other signs of self-consciousness which generally
accompany blushing; and it is one of their chief charms that they think
nothing about what others think of them. At this early age they will
stare at a stranger with a fixed gaze and un-blinking eyes, as on an
inanimate object, in a manner which we elders cannot imitate.

It is plain to every one that young men and women are highly sensitive
to the opinion of each other with reference to their personal
appearance; and they blush incomparably more in the presence of the
opposite sex than in that of their own.[1325] A young man, not very
liable to blush, will blush intensely at any slight ridicule of his
appearance from a girl whose judgment on any important subject lie
would disregard. No happy pair of young lovers, valuing each other's
admiration and love more than anything else in the world, probably ever
courted each other without many a blush. Even the barbarians of Tierra
del Fuego, according to Mr. Bridges, blush "chiefly in regard to women,
but certainly also at their own personal appearance."

Of all parts of the body, the face is most considered and regarded, as
is natural from its being the chief seat of expression and the source
of the voice. It is also the chief seat of beauty and of ugliness, and
throughout the world is the most ornamented.[1326] The face, therefore,
will have been subjected during many generations to much closer and
more earnest self-attention than any other part of the body; and in
accordance with the principle here advanced we can understand why it
should be the most liable to blush. Although exposure to alternations
of temperature, &c., has probably much increased the power of dilatation
and contraction in the capillaries of the face and adjoining parts, yet
this by itself will hardly account for these parts blushing much more
than the rest of the body; for it does not explain the fact of the hands
rarely blushing. With Europeans the whole body tingles slightly when
the face blushes intensely; and with the races of men who habitually go
nearly naked, the blushes extend over a much larger surface than
with us. These facts are, to a certain extent, intelligible, as the
self-attention of primeval man, as well as of the existing races which
still go naked, will not have been so exclusively confined to their
faces, as is the case with the people who now go clothed.

We have seen that in all parts of the world persons who feel shame
for some moral delinquency, are apt to avert, bend down, or hide their
faces, independently of any thought about their personal appearance.
The object can hardly be to conceal their blushes, for the face is
thus averted or hidden under circumstances which exclude any desire to
conceal shame, as when guilt is fully confessed and repented of. It is,
however, probable that primeval man before he had acquired much moral
sensitiveness would have been highly sensitive about his personal
appearance, at least in reference to the other sex, and he would
consequently have felt distress at any depreciatory remarks about his
appearance; and this is one form of shame. And as the face is the part
of the body which is most regarded, it is intelligible that any one
ashamed of his personal appearance would desire to conceal this part
of his body. The habit having been thus acquired, would naturally be
carried on when shame from strictly moral causes was felt; and it is not
easy otherwise to see why under these circumstances there should be a
desire to hide the face more than any other part of the body.

The habit, so general with every one who feels ashamed, of turning
away, or lowering his eyes, or restlessly moving them from side to
side, probably follows from each glance directed towards those present,
bringing home the conviction that he is intently regarded; and he
endeavours, by not looking at those present, and especially not at their
eyes, momentarily to escape from this painful conviction.


_Shyness_.--This odd state of mind, often called shamefacedness,
or false shame, or _mauvaise honte_, appears to be one of the most
efficient of all the causes of blushing. Shyness is, indeed, chiefly
recognized by the face reddening, by the eyes being averted or cast
down, and by awkward, nervous movements of the body. Many a woman
blushes from this cause, a hundred, perhaps a thousand times, to once
that she blushes from having done anything deserving blame, and of which
she is truly ashamed. Shyness seems to depend on sensitiveness to the
opinion, whether good or bad, of others, more especially with respect to
external appearance. Strangers neither know nor care anything about
our conduct or character, but they may, and often do, criticize our
appearance: hence shy persons are particularly apt to be shy and to
blush in the presence of strangers. The consciousness of anything
peculiar, or even new, in the dress, or any slight blemish on the
person, and more especially, on the face--points which are likely to
attract the attention of strangers--makes the shy intolerably shy.
On the other hand, in those cases in which conduct and not personal
appearance is concerned, we are much more apt to be shy in the presence
of acquaintances, whose judgment we in some degree value, than in that
of strangers. A physician told me that a young man, a wealthy duke, with
whom he had travelled as medical attendant, blushed like a girl, when he
paid him his fee; yet this young man probably would not have blushed
and been shy, had he been paying a bill to a tradesman. Some persons,
however, are so sensitive, that the mere act of speaking to almost any
one is sufficient to rouse their self-consciousness, and a slight blush
is the result.

Disapprobation or ridicule, from our sensitiveness on this head, causes
shyness and blushing much more readily than does approbation; though the
latter with some persons is highly efficient. The conceited are rarely
shy; for they value themselves much too highly to expect depreciation.
Why a proud man is often shy, as appears to be the case, is not so
obvious, unless it be that, with all his self-reliance, he really
thinks much about the opinion of others although in a disdainful spirit.
Persons who are exceedingly shy are rarely shy in the presence of
those with whom they are quite familiar, and of whose good opinion
and sympathy they are perfectly assured;--for instance, a girl in the
presence of her mother. I neglected to inquire in my printed paper
whether shyness can be detected in the different races of man; but a
Hindoo gentleman assured Mr. Erskine that it is recognizable in his
countrymen.

Shyness, as the derivation of the word indicates in several
languages,[1327] is closely related to fear; yet it is distinct from
fear in the ordinary sense. A shy man no doubt dreads the notice of
strangers, but can hardly be said to be afraid of them, he may be as
bold as a hero in battle, and yet have no self-confidence about trifles
in the presence of strangers. Almost every one is extremely nervous when
first addressing a public assembly, and most men remain so throughout
their lives; but this appears to depend on the consciousness of a great
coming exertion, with its associated effects on the system, rather than
on shyness;[1328] although a timid or shy man no doubt suffers on such
occasions infinitely more than another. With very young children it
is difficult to distinguish between fear and shyness; but this latter
feeling with them has often seemed to me to partake of the character of
the wildness of an untamed animal. Shyness comes on at a very early age.
In one of my own children, when two years and three months old, I saw a
trace of what certainly appeared to be shyness, directed towards myself
after an absence from home of only a week. This was shown not by a
blush, but by the eyes being for a few minutes slightly averted from
me. I have noticed on other occasions that shyness or shamefacedness and
real shame are exhibited in the eyes of young children before they have
acquired the power of blushing.

As shyness apparently depends on self-attention, we can perceive how
right are those who maintain that reprehending children for shyness,
instead of doing them any good, does much harm, as it calls their
attention still more closely to themselves. It has been well urged that
"nothing hurts young people more than to be watched continually about
their feelings, to have their countenances scrutinized, and the degrees
of their sensibility measured by the surveying eye of the unmerciful
spectator. Under the constraint of such examinations they can think
of nothing but that they are looked at, and feel nothing but shame or
apprehension."[1329]


_Moral causes: guilt_.--With respect to blushing from strictly moral
causes, we meet with the same fundamental principle as before, namely,
regard for the opinion of others. It is not the conscience which raises
a blush, for a man may sincerely regret some slight fault committed in
solitude, or he may suffer the deepest remorse for an undetected crime,
but he will not blush. "I blush," says Dr. Burgess,[1330] "in the
presence of my accusers." It is not the sense of guilt, but the thought
that others think or know us to be guilty which crimsons the face. A man
may feel thoroughly ashamed at having told a small falsehood, without
blushing; but if he even suspects that he is detected he will instantly
blush, especially if detected by one whom he reveres.

On the other hand, a man may be convinced that God witnesses all his
actions, and he may feel deeply conscious of some fault and pray
for forgiveness; but this will not, as a lady who is a great blusher
believes, ever excite a blush. The explanation of this difference
between the knowledge by God and man of our actions lies, I presume, in
man's disapprobation of immoral conduct being somewhat akin in nature to
his depreciation of our personal appearance, so that through association
both lead to similar results; whereas the disapprobation of God brings
up no such association.

Many a person has blushed intensely when accused of some crime, though
completely innocent of it. Even the thought, as the lady before referred
to has observed to me, that others think that we have made an unkind or
stupid remark, is amply sufficient to cause a blush, although we know
all the time that we have been completely misunderstood. An action may
be meritorious or of an indifferent nature, but a sensitive person, if
he suspects that others take a different view of it, will blush. For
instance, a lady by herself may give money to a beggar without a trace
of a blush, but if others are present, and she doubts whether they
approve, or suspects that they think her influenced by display, she will
blush. So it will be, if she offers to relieve the distress of a decayed
gentlewoman, more particularly of one whom she had previously known
under better circumstances, as she cannot then feel sure how her conduct
will be viewed. But such cases as these blend into shyness.


_Breaches of etiquette_.--The rules of _etiquette_ always refer to
conduct in the presence of, or towards others. They have no necessary
connection with the moral sense, and are often meaningless. Nevertheless
as they depend on the fixed custom of our equals and superiors, whose
opinion we highly regard, they are considered almost as binding as are
the laws of honour to a gentleman. Consequently the breach of the laws
of etiquette, that is, any impoliteness or _gaucherie_, any impropriety,
or an inappropriate remark, though quite accidental, will cause the most
intense blushing of which a man is capable. Even the recollection of
such an act, after an interval of many years, will make the whole body
to tingle. So strong, also, is the power of sympathy that a sensitive
person, as a lady has assured me, will sometimes blush at a flagrant
breach of etiquette by a perfect stranger, though the act may in no way
concern her.


_Modesty_.--This is another powerful agent in exciting blushes; but
the word modesty includes very different states of the mind. It implies
humility, and we often judge of this by persons being greatly pleased
and blushing at slight praise, or by being annoyed at praise which seems
to them too high according to their own humble standard of themselves.
Blushing here has the usual signification of regard for the opinion
of others. But modesty frequently relates to acts of indelicacy; and
indelicacy is an affair of etiquette, as we clearly see with the nations
that go altogether or nearly naked. He who is modest, and blushes easily
at acts of this nature, does so because they are breaches of a firmly
and wisely established etiquette. This is indeed shown by the derivation
of the word _modest_ from _modus_, a measure or standard of behaviour.
A blush due to this form of modesty is, moreover, apt to be intense,
because it generally relates to the opposite sex; and we have seen how
in all cases our liability to blush is thus increased. We apply the term
'modest,' as it would appear, to those who have an humble opinion of
themselves, and to those who are extremely sensitive about an indelicate
word or deed, simply because in both cases blushes are readily excited,
for these two frames of mind have nothing else in common. Shyness also,
from this same cause, is often mistaken for modesty in the sense of
humility.

Some persons flush up, as I have observed and have been assured, at any
sudden and disagreeable recollection. The commonest cause seems to be
the sudden remembrance of not having done something for another person
which had been promised. In this case it may be that the thought passes
half unconsciously through the mind, "What will he think of me?" and
then the flush would partake of the nature of a true blush. But whether
such flushes are in most cases due to the capillary circulation being
affected, is very doubtful; for we must remember that almost every
strong emotion, such as anger or great joy, acts on the heart, and
causes the face to redden.

The fact that blushes may be excited in absolute solitude seems opposed
to the view here taken, namely that the habit originally arose from
thinking about what others think of us. Several ladies, who are great
blushers, are unanimous in regard to solitude; and some of them believe
that they have blushed in the dark. From what Mr. Forbes has stated with
respect to the Aymaras, and from my own sensations, I have no doubt that
this latter statement is correct. Shakspeare, therefore, erred when
he made Juliet, who was not even by herself, say to Romeo (act ii. sc.
2):--

    "Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face;
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek,
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night."

But when a blush is excited in solitude, the cause almost always relates
to the thoughts of others about us--to acts done in their presence,
or suspected by them; or again when we reflect what others would have
thought of us had they known of the act. Nevertheless one or two of my
informants believe that they have blushed from shame at acts in no way
relating to others. If this be so, we must attribute the result to the
force of inveterate habit and association, under a state of mind closely
analogous to that which ordinarily excites a blush; nor need we feel
surprise at this, as even sympathy with another person who commits
a flagrant breach of etiquette is believed, as we have just seen,
sometimes to cause a blush.

Finally, then, I conclude that blushing,--whether due to shyness--to
shame for a real crime--to shame from a breach of the laws
of etiquette--to modesty from humility--to modesty from an
indelicacy--depends in all cases on the same principle; this principle
being a sensitive regard for the opinion, more particularly for
the depreciation of others, primarily in relation to our personal
appearance, especially of our faces; and secondarily, through the force
of association and habit, in relation to the opinion of others on our
conduct.


_Theory of Blushing_.--We have now to consider, why should the thought
that others are thinking about us affect our capillary circulation? Sir
C. Bell insists[1331] that blushing "is a provision for expression, as
may be inferred from the colour extending only to the surface of the
face, neck, and breast, the parts most exposed. It is not acquired; it
is from the beginning." Dr. Burgess believes that it was designed by the
Creator in "order that the soul might have sovereign power of displaying
in the cheeks the various internal emotions of the moral feelings;" so
as to serve as a check on ourselves, and as a sign to others, that we
were violating rules which ought to be held sacred. Gratiolet merely
remarks,--"Or, comme il est dans l'ordre de la nature que l'etre social
le plus intelligent soit aussi le plus intelligible, cette faculte de
rougeur et de paleur qui distingue l'homme, est un signe naturel de sa
haute perfection."

The belief that blushing was SPECIALLY designed by the Creator is
opposed to the general theory of evolution, which is now so largely
accepted; but it forms no part of my duty here to argue on the general
question. Those who believe in design, will find it difficult to account
for shyness being the most frequent and efficient of all the causes
of blushing, as it makes the blusher to suffer and the beholder
uncomfortable, without being of the least service to either of them.
They will also find it difficult to account for negroes and other
dark-coloured races blushing, in whom a change of colour in the skin is
scarcely or not at all visible.

No doubt a slight blush adds to the beauty of a maiden's face; and the
Circassian women who are capable of blushing, invariably fetch a higher
price in the seraolio of the Sultan than less susceptible women.[1332]
But the firmest believer in the efficacy of sexual selection will hardly
suppose that blushing was acquired as a sexual ornament. This view would
also be opposed to what has just been said about the dark-coloured
races blushing in an invisible manner.

The hypothesis which appears to me the most probable, though it may at
first seem rash, is that attention closely directed to any part of the
body tends to interfere with the ordinary and tonic contraction of the
small arteries of that part. These vessels, in consequence, become at
such times more or less relaxed, and are instantly filled with arterial
blood. This tendency will have been much strengthened, if frequent
attention has been paid during many generations to the same part, owing
to nerve-force readily flowing along accustomed channels, and by the
power of inheritance. Whenever we believe that others are depreciating
or even considering our personal appearance, our attention is vividly
directed to the outer and visible parts of our bodies; and of all such
parts we are most sensitive about our faces, as no doubt has been the
case during many past generations. Therefore, assuming for the moment
that the capillary vessels can be acted on by close attention, those of
the face will have become eminently susceptible. Through the force of
association, the same effects will tend to follow whenever we think that
others are considering or censuring our actions or character.

As the basis of this theory rests on mental attention having some power
to influence the capillary circulation, it will be necessary to give
a considerable body of details, bearing more or less directly on this
subject. Several observers,[1333] who from their wide experience
and knowledge are eminently capable of forming a sound judgment, are
convinced that attention or consciousness (which latter term Sir H.
Holland thinks the more explicit) concentrated on almost any part of
the body produces some direct physical effect on it. This applies to the
movements of the involuntary muscles, and of the voluntary muscles when
acting involuntarily,--to the secretion of the glands,--to the activity
of the senses and sensations,--and even to the nutrition of parts.

It is known that the involuntary movements of the heart are affected
if close attention be paid to them. Gratiolet[1334] gives the case of
a man, who by continually watching and counting his own pulse, at last
caused one beat out of every six to intermit. On the other hand, my
father told me of a careful observer, who certainly had heart-disease
and died from it, and who positively stated that his pulse was
habitually irregular to an extreme degree; yet to his great
disappointment it invariably became regular as soon as my father entered
the room. Sir H. Holland remarks,[1335] that "the effect upon the
circulation of a part from the consciousness suddenly directed and fixed
upon it, is often obvious and immediate." Professor Laycock, who has
particularly attended to phenomena of this nature,[1336] insists that
"when the attention is directed to any portion of the body, innervation
and circulation are excited locally, and the functional activity of that
portion developed."

It is generally believed that the peristaltic movements of the
intestines are influenced by attention being paid to them at fixed
recurrent periods; and these movements depend on the contraction of
unstriped and involuntary muscles. The abnormal action of the voluntary
muscles in epilepsy, chorea, and hysteria is known to be influenced
by the expectation of an attack, and by the sight of other patients
similarly affected.[1337] So it is with the involuntary acts of yawning
and laughing.

Certain glands are much influenced by thinking of them, or of the
conditions under which they have been habitually excited. This is
familiar to every one in the increased flow of saliva, when the thought,
for instance, of intensely acid fruit is kept before the mind. It was
shown in our sixth chapter, that an earnest and long-continued desire
either to repress, or to increase, the action of the lacrymal glands is
effectual. Some curious cases have been recorded in the case of
women, of the power of the mind on the mammary glands; and still more
remarkable ones in relation to the uterine functions.[1339]


[1335] 'Chapters on Mental Physiology,' 1858, p. 111. [1336] 'Mind find
Brain,' vol. ii. 1860, p. 327. [1337] 'Chapters on Mental Physiology,'
pp. 104-106. [1338] See Gratiolet on this subject, De la Phys. p. 287.
[1339] Dr. J. Crichton Browne, from his observations on the insane, is
convinced that attention directed for a prolonged period on any part or
organ may ultimately influence its capillary circulation and nutrition.
He has given me some extraordinary cases; one of these, which cannot
here be related in full, refers to a married woman fifty years of age,
who laboured under the firm and long-continued delusion that she was
pregnant. When the expected period arrived, she acted precisely as if
she had been really delivered of a child, and seemed to suffer extreme
pain, so that the perspiration broke out on her forehead. The result was
that a state of things returned, continuing for three days, which had
ceased during the six previous years. Mr. Braid gives, in his 'Magic,
Hypnotism,' &c., 1852, p. 95, and in his other works analogous cases,
as well as other facts showing the great influence of the will on the
mammary glands, even on one breast alone.

When we direct our whole attention to any one sense, its acuteness is
increased;[1340] and the continued habit of close attention, as with
blind people to that of hearing, and with the blind and deaf to that of
touch, appears to improve the sense in question permanently. There is,
also, some reason to believe, judging from the capacities of different
races of man, that the effects are inherited. Turning to ordinary
sensations, it is well known that pain is increased by attending to it;
and Sir B. Brodie goes so far as to believe that pain may be felt in
any part of the body to which attention is closely drawn.[1341] Sir H.
Holland also remarks that we become not only conscious of the existence
of a part subjected to concentrated attention, but we experience in
it various odd sensations as of weight, heat, cold, tingling, or
itching.[1342]

Lastly, some physiologists maintain that the mind can influence the
nutrition of parts. Sir J. Paget has given a curious instance of the
power, not indeed of the mind, but of the nervous system, on the hair.
A lady "who is subject to attacks of what is called nervous headache,
always finds in the morning after such an one, that some patches of her
hair are white, as if powdered with starch. The change is effected in
a night, and in a few days after, the hairs gradually regain their dark
brownish colour."[1343]

We thus see that close attention certainly affects various parts and
organs, which are not properly under the control of the will. By what
means attention--perhaps the most wonderful of all the wondrous powers
of the mind--is effected, is an extremely obscure subject. According to
Muller,[1344] the process by which the sensory cells of the brain are
rendered, through the will, susceptible of receiving more intense and
distinct impressions, is closely analogous to that by which the motor
cells are excited to send nerve-force to the voluntary muscles. There
are many points of analogy in the action of the sensory and motor
nerve-cells; for instance, the familiar fact that close attention to
any one sense causes fatigue, like the prolonged exertion of any one
muscle.[1345] When therefore we voluntarily concentrate our attention on
any part of the body, the cells of the brain which receive impressions
or sensations from that part are, it is probable, in some unknown manner
stimulated into activity. This may account, without any local change in
the part to which our attention is earnestly directed, for pain or odd
sensations being there felt or increased.

If, however, the part is furnished with muscles, we cannot feel sure, as
Mr. Michael Foster has remarked to me, that some slight impulse may not
be unconsciously sent to such muscles; and this would probably cause an
obscure sensation in the part.

In a large number of cases, as with the salivary and lacrymal glands,
intestinal canal, &c., the power of attention seems to rest, either
chiefly, or as some physiologists think, exclusively, on the vaso-motor
system being affected in such a manner that more blood is allowed to
flow into the capillaries of the part in question. This increased action
of the capillaries may in some cases be combined with the simultaneously
increased activity of the sensorium.

The manner in which the mind affects the vasomotor system may be
conceived in the following manner. When we actually taste sour fruit, an
impression is sent through the gustatory nerves to a certain part of
the sensorium; this transmits nerve-force to the vasomotor centre,
which consequently allows the muscular coats of the small arteries that
permeate the salivary glands to relax. Hence more blood flows into these
glands, and they secrete a copious supply of saliva. Now it does not
seem an improbable assumption, that, when we reflect intently on a
sensation, the same part of the sensorium, or a closely connected part
of it, is brought into a state of activity, in the same manner as when
we actually perceive the sensation. If so, the same cells in the brain
will be excited, though, perhaps, in a less degree, by vividly thinking
about a sour taste, as by perceiving it; and they will transmit in the
one case, as in the other, nerve-force to the vaso-motor centre with the
same results.

To give another, and, in some respects, more appropriate illustration.
If a man stands before a hot fire, his face reddens. This appears to be
due, as Mr. Michael Foster informs me, in part to the local action
of the heat, and in part to a reflex action from the vaso-motor
centres.[1346] In this latter case, the heat affects the nerves of the
face; these transmit an impression to the sensory cells of the brain,
which act on the vaso-motor centre, and this reacts on the small
arteries of the face, relaxing them and allowing them to become filled
with blood. Here, again, it seems not improbable that if we were
repeatedly to concentrate with great earnestness our attention on the
recollection of our heated faces, the same part of the sensorium which
gives us the consciousness of actual heat would be in some slight degree
stimulated, and would in consequence tend to transmit some nerve-force
to the vaso-motor centres, so as to relax the capillaries of the face.
Now as men during endless generations have had their attention often and
earnestly directed to their personal appearance, and especially to
their faces, any incipient tendency in the facial capillaries to be thus
affected will have become in the course of time greatly strengthened
through the principles just referred to, namely, nerve-force passing
readily along accustomed channels, and inherited habit. Thus, as it
appears to me, a plausible explanation is afforded of the leading
phenomena connected with the act of blushing.


_Recapitulation_.--Men and women, and especially the young, have always
valued, in a high degree, their personal appearance; and have likewise
regarded the appearance of others. The face has been the chief object of
attention, though, when man aboriginally went naked, the whole surface
of his body would have been attended to. Our self-attention is excited
almost exclusively by the opinion of others, for no person living in
absolute solitude would care about his appearance. Every one feels blame
more acutely than praise. Now, whenever we know, or suppose, that others
are depreciating our personal appearance, our attention is strongly
drawn towards ourselves, more especially to our faces. The probable
effect of this will be, as has just been explained, to excite into
activity that part of the sensorium, which receives the sensory nerves
of the face; and this will react through the vaso-motor system on
the facial capillaries. By frequent reiteration during numberless
generations, the process will have become so habitual, in association
with the belief that others are thinking of us, that even a suspicion
of their depreciation suffices to relax the capillaries, without any
conscious thought about our faces. With some sensitive persons it is
enough even to notice their dress to produce the same effect. Through
the force, also, of association and inheritance our capillaries are
relaxed, whenever we know, or imagine, that any one is blaming, though
in silence, our actions, thoughts, or character; and, again, when we are
highly praised.

On this hypothesis we can understand how it is that the face blushes
much more than any other part of the body, though the whole surface is
somewhat affected, more especially with the races which still go nearly
naked. It is not at all surprising that the dark-coloured races should
blush, though no change of colour is visible in their skins. From the
principle of inheritance it is not surprising that persons born blind
should blush. We can understand why the young are much more affected
than the old, and women more than men; and why the opposite sexes
especially excite each other's blushes. It becomes obvious why personal
remarks should be particularly liable to cause blushing, and why the
most powerful of all the causes is shyness; for shyness relates to the
presence and opinion of others, and the shy are always more or less
self-conscious. With respect to real shame from moral delinquencies, we
can perceive why it is not guilt, but the thought that others think us
guilty, which raises a blush. A man reflecting on a crime committed in
solitude, and stung by his conscience, does not blush; yet he will blush
under the vivid recollection of a detected fault, or of one committed in
the presence of others, the degree of blushing being closely related
to the feeling of regard for those who have detected, witnessed, or
suspected his fault. Breaches of conventional rules of conduct, if they
are rigidly insisted on by our equals or superiors, often cause more
intense blushes even than a detected crime, and an act which is really
criminal, if not blamed by our equals, hardly raises a tinge of colour
on our cheeks. Modesty from humility, or from an indelicacy, excites a
vivid blush, as both relate to the judgment or fixed customs of others.

From the intimate sympathy which exists between the capillary
circulation of the surface of the head and of the brain, whenever there
is intense blushing, there will be some, and often great, confusion of
mind. This is frequently accompanied by awkward movements, and sometimes
by the involuntary twitching of certain muscles.

As blushing, according to this hypothesis, is an indirect result of
attention, originally directed to our personal appearance, that is
to the surface of the body, and more especially to the face, we
can understand the meaning of the gestures which accompany blushing
throughout the world. These consist in hiding the face, or turning it
towards the ground, or to one side. The eyes are generally averted or
are restless, for to look at the man who causes us to feel shame
or shyness, immediately brings home in an intolerable manner the
consciousness that his gaze is directed on us. Through the principle of
associated habit, the same movements of the face and eyes are practised,
and can, indeed, hardly be avoided, whenever we know or believe that,
others are blaming, or too strongly praising, our moral conduct.



CHAPTER XIV. -- CONCLUDING REMARKS AND SUMMARY.

The three leading principles which have determined the chief movements
of expression--Their inheritance--On the part which the will and
intention have played in the acquirement of various expressions--The
instinctive recognition of expression--The bearing of our subject on
the specific unity of the races of man--On the successive acquirement
of various expressions by the progenitors of man--The importance of
expression--Conclusion.


I HAVE now described, to the best of my ability, the chief expressive
actions in man, and in some few of the lower animals. I have also
attempted to explain the origin or development of these actions through
the three principles given in the first chapter. The first of these
principles is, that movements which are serviceable in gratifying some
desire, or in relieving some sensation, if often repeated, become
so habitual that they are performed, whether or not of any service,
whenever the same desire or sensation is felt, even in a very weak
degree.

Our second principle is that of antithesis. The habit of voluntarily
performing opposite movements under opposite impulses has become firmly
established in us by the practice of our whole lives. Hence, if certain
actions have been regularly performed, in accordance with our first
principle, under a certain frame of mind, there will be a strong and
involuntary tendency to the performance of directly opposite actions,
whether or not these are of any use, under the excitement of an opposite
frame of mind.

Our third principle is the direct action of the excited nervous system
on the body, independently of the will, and independently, in large
part, of habit. Experience shows that nerve-force is generated and set
free whenever the cerebro-spinal system is excited. The direction which
this nerve-force follows is necessarily determined by the lines of
connection between the nerve-cells, with each other and with various
parts of the body. But the direction is likewise much influenced by
habit; inasmuch as nerve-force passes readily along accustomed channels.

The frantic and senseless actions of an enraged man may be attributed in
part to the undirected flow of nerve-force, and in part to the effects
of habit, for these actions often vaguely represent the act of striking.
They thus pass into gestures included under our first principle; as when
an indignant man unconsciously throws himself into a fitting attitude
for attacking his opponent, though without any intention of making an
actual attack. We see also the influence of habit in all the emotions
and sensations which are called exciting; for they have assumed this
character from having habitually led to energetic action; and action
affects, in an indirect manner, the respiratory and circulatory
system; and the latter reacts on the brain. Whenever these emotions or
sensations are even slightly felt by us, though they may not at the time
lead to any exertion, our whole system is nevertheless disturbed through
the force of habit and association. Other emotions and sensations are
called depressing, because they have not habitually led to energetic
action, excepting just at first, as in the case of extreme pain, fear,
and grief, and they have ultimately caused complete exhaustion; they
are consequently expressed chiefly by negative signs and by prostration.
Again, there are other emotions, such as that of affection, which do not
commonly lead to action of any kind, and consequently are not exhibited
by any strongly marked outward signs. Affection indeed, in as far as it
is a pleasurable sensation, excites the ordinary signs of pleasure.

On the other hand, many of the effects due to the excitement of the
nervous system seem to be quite independent of the flow of nerve-force
along the channels which have been rendered habitual by former exertions
of the will. Such effects, which often reveal the state of mind of the
person thus affected, cannot at present be explained; for instance, the
change of colour in the hair from extreme terror or grief,--the
cold sweat and the trembling of the muscles from fear,--the modified
secretions of the intestinal canal,--and the failure of certain glands
to act.

Notwithstanding that much remains unintelligible in our present subject,
so many expressive movements and actions can be explained to a certain
extent through the above three principles, that we may hope hereafter to
see all explained by these or by closely analogous principles.

Actions of all kinds, if regularly accompanying any state of the mind,
are at once recognized as expressive. These may consist of movements of
any part of the body, as the wagging of a dog's tail, the shrugging of
a man's shoulders, the erection of the hair, the exudation of
perspiration, the state of the capillary circulation, laboured
breathing, and the use of the vocal or other sound-producing
instruments. Even insects express anger, terror, jealousy, and love
by their stridulation. With man the respiratory organs are of especial
importance in expression, not only in a direct, but in a still higher
degree in an indirect manner.

Few points are more interesting in our present subject than the
extraordinarily complex chain of events which lead to certain expressive
movements. Take, for instance, the oblique eyebrows of a man suffering
from grief or anxiety. When infants scream loudly from hunger or pain,
the circulation is affected, and the eyes tend to become gorged with
blood: consequently the muscles surrounding the eyes are strongly
contracted as a protection: this action, in the course of many
generations, has become firmly fixed and inherited: but when, with
advancing years and culture, the habit of screaming is partially
repressed, the muscles round the eyes still tend to contract, whenever
even slight distress is felt: of these muscles, the pyramidals of the
nose are less under the control of the will than are the others and
their contraction can be checked only by that of the central fasciae of
the frontal muscle: these latter fasciae draw up the inner ends of
the eyebrows, and wrinkle the forehead in a peculiar manner, which
we instantly recognize as the expression of grief or anxiety. Slight
movements, such as these just described, or the scarcely perceptible
drawing down of the corners of the mouth, are the last remnants or
rudiments of strongly marked and intelligible movements. They are as
full of significance to us in regard to expression, as are ordinary
rudiments to the naturalist in the classification and genealogy of
organic beings.

That the chief expressive actions, exhibited by man and by the lower
animals, are now innate or inherited,--that is, have not been learnt
by the individual,--is admitted by every one. So little has learning
or imitation to do with several of them that they are from the earliest
days and throughout life quite beyond our control; for instance, the
relaxation of the arteries of the skin in blushing, and the increased
action of the heart in anger. We may see children, only two or three
years old, and even those born blind, blushing from shame; and the naked
scalp of a very young infant reddens from passion. Infants scream from
pain directly after birth, and all their features then assume the same
form as during subsequent years. These facts alone suffice to show that
many of our most important expressions have not been learnt; but it is
remarkable that some, which are certainly innate, require practice in
the individual, before they are performed in a full and perfect manner;
for instance, weeping and laughing. The inheritance of most of our
expressive actions explains the fact that those born blind display them,
as I hear from the Rev. R. H. Blair, equally well with those gifted with
eyesight. We can thus also understand the fact that the young and the
old of widely different races, both with man and animals, express the
same state of mind by the same movements.

We are so familiar with the fact of young and old animals displaying
their feelings in the same manner, that we hardly perceive how
remarkable it is that a young puppy should wag its tail when pleased,
depress its ears and uncover its canine teeth when pretending to be
savage, just like an old dog; or that a kitten should arch its little
back and erect its hair when frightened and angry, like an old cat.
When, however, we turn to less common gestures in ourselves, which
we are accustomed to look at as artificial or conventional,--such as
shrugging the shoulders, as a sign of impotence, or the raising the
arms with open hands and extended fingers, as a sign of wonder,--we feel
perhaps too much surprise at finding that they are innate. That these
and some other gestures are inherited, we may infer from their being
performed by very young children, by those born blind, and by the most
widely distinct races of man. We should also bear in mind that new and
highly peculiar tricks, in association with certain states of the
mind, are known to have arisen in certain individuals, and to have been
afterwards transmitted to their offspring, in some cases, for more than
one generation.

Certain other gestures, which seem to us so natural that we might easily
imagine that they were innate, apparently have been learnt like the
words of a language. This seems to be the case with the joining of the
uplifted hands, and the turning up of the eyes, in prayer. So it is
with kissing as a mark of affection; but this is innate, in so far as it
depends on the pleasure derived from contact with a beloved person.
The evidence with respect to the inheritance of nodding and shaking the
head, as signs of affirmation and negation, is doubtful; for they are
not universal, yet seem too general to have been independently acquired
by all the individuals of so many races.


We will now consider how far the will and consciousness have come into
play in the development of the various movements of expression. As far
as we can judge, only a few expressive movements, such as those just
referred to, are learnt by each individual; that is, were consciously
and voluntarily performed during the early years of life for some
definite object, or in imitation of others, and then became habitual.
The far greater number of the movements of expression, and all the more
important ones, are, as we have seen, innate or inherited; and such
cannot be said to depend on the will of the individual. Nevertheless,
all those included under our first principle were at first voluntarily
performed for a definite object,--namely, to escape some danger, to
relieve some distress, or to gratify some desire. For instance, there
can hardly be a doubt that the animals which fight with their teeth,
have acquired the habit of drawing back their ears closely to their
heads, when feeling savage, from their progenitors having voluntarily
acted in this manner in order to protect their ears from being torn by
their antagonists; for those animals which do not fight with their
teeth do not thus express a savage state of mind. We may infer as highly
probable that we ourselves have acquired the habit of contracting the
muscles round the eyes, whilst crying gently, that is, without the
utterance of any loud sound, from our progenitors, especially
during infancy, having experienced, during the act of screaming, an
uncomfortable sensation in their eyeballs. Again, some highly expressive
movements result from the endeavour to cheek or prevent other expressive
movements; thus the obliquity of the eyebrows and the drawing down
of the corners of the mouth follow from the endeavour to prevent a
screaming-fit from coming on, or to cheek it after it has come on. Here
it is obvious that the consciousness and will must at first have come
into play; not that we are conscious in these or in other such cases
what muscles are brought into action, any more than when we perform the
most ordinary voluntary movements.

With respect to the expressive movements due to the principle of
antithesis, it is clear that the will has intervened, though in a remote
and indirect manner. So again with the movements coming under our
third principle; these, in as far as they are influenced by nerve-force
readily passing along habitual channels, have been determined by former
and repeated exertions of the will. The effects indirectly due to this
latter agency are often combined in a complex manner, through the
force of habit and association, with those directly resulting from the
excitement of the cerebro-spinal system. This seems to be the case with
the increased action of the heart under the influence of any strong
emotion. When an animal erects its hair, assumes a threatening attitude,
and utters fierce sounds, in order to terrify an enemy, we see a curious
combination of movements which were originally voluntary with those that
are involuntary. It is, however, possible that even strictly involuntary
actions, such as the erection of the hair, may have been affected by the
mysterious power of the will.

Some expressive movements may have arisen spontaneously, in association
with certain states of the mind, like the tricks lately referred to, and
afterwards been inherited. But I know of no evidence rendering this view
probable.

The power of communication between the members of the same tribe by
means of language has been of paramount importance in the development of
man; and the force of language is much aided by the expressive movements
of the face and body. We perceive this at once when we converse on an
important subject with any person whose face is concealed. Nevertheless
there are no grounds, as far as I can discover, for believing that any
muscle has been developed or even modified exclusively for the sake of
expression. The vocal and other sound-producing organs, by which various
expressive noises are produced, seem to form a partial exception; but I
have elsewhere attempted to show that these organs were first developed
for sexual purposes, in order that one sex might call or charm the
other. Nor can I discover grounds for believing that any inherited
movement, which now serves as a means of expression, was at first
voluntarily and consciously performed for this special purpose,--like
some of the gestures and the finger-language used by the deaf and dumb.
On the contrary, every true or inherited movement of expression seems
to have had some natural and independent origin. But when once acquired,
such movements may be voluntarily and consciously employed as a means
of communication. Even infants, if carefully attended to, find out at
a very early age that their screaming brings relief, and they soon
voluntarily practise it. We may frequently see a person voluntarily
raising his eyebrows to express surprise, or smiling to express
pretended satisfaction and acquiescence. A man often wishes to make
certain gestures conspicuous or demonstrative, and will raise his
extended arms with widely opened fingers above his head, to show
astonishment, or lift his shoulders to his ears, to show that he
cannot or will not do something. The tendency to such movements will be
strengthened or increased by their being thus voluntarily and repeatedly
performed; and the effects may be inherited.

It is perhaps worth consideration whether movements at first used only
by one or a few individuals to express a certain state of mind may not
sometimes have spread to others, and ultimately have become universal,
through the power of conscious and unconscious imitation. That there
exists in man a strong tendency to imitation, independently of the
conscious will, is certain. This is exhibited in the most extraordinary
manner in certain brain diseases, especially at the commencement of
inflammatory softening of the brain, and has been called the "echo
sign." Patients thus affected imitate, without understanding every
absurd gesture which is made, and every word which is uttered near them,
even in a foreign language.[1401] In the case of animals, the jackal and
wolf have learnt under confinement to imitate the barking of the dog.
How the barking of the dog, which serves to express various emotions and
desires, and which is so remarkable from having been acquired since the
animal was domesticated, and from being inherited in different degrees
by different breeds, was first learnt we do not know; but may we not
suspect that imitation has had something to do with its acquisition,
owing to dogs having long lived in strict association with so loquacious
an animal as man?

In the course of the foregoing remarks and throughout this volume, I
have often felt much difficulty about the proper application of the
terms, will, consciousness, and intention. Actions, which were at first
voluntary, soon became habitual, and at last hereditary, and may then be
performed even in opposition to the will. Although they often reveal
the state of the mind, this result was not at first either intended or
expected. Even such words as that "certain movements serve as a means
of expression," are apt to mislead, as they imply that this was their
primary purpose or object. This, however, seems rarely or never to have
been the case; the movements having been at first either of some direct
use, or the indirect effect of the excited state of the sensorium. An
infant may scream either intentionally or instinctively to show that it
wants food; but it has no wish or intention to draw its features into
the peculiar form which so plainly indicates misery; yet some of the
most characteristic expressions exhibited by man are derived from the
act of screaming, as has been explained.

Although most of our expressive actions are innate or instinctive, as
is admitted by everyone, it is a different question whether we have any
instinctive power of recognizing them. This has generally been assumed
to be the case; but the assumption has been strongly controverted by M.
Lemoine.[1402] Monkeys soon learn to distinguish, not only the tones
of voice of their masters, but the expression of their faces, as is
asserted by a careful observer.[1403] Dogs well know the difference
between caressing and threatening gestures or tones; and they seem to
recognize a compassionate tone. But as far as I can make out, after
repeated trials, they do not understand any movement confined to the
features, excepting a smile or laugh; and this they appear, at least in
some cases, to recognize. This limited amount of knowledge has probably
been gained, both by monkeys and dogs, through their associating harsh
or kind treatment with our actions; and the knowledge certainly is
not instinctive. Children, no doubt, would soon learn the movements of
expression in their elders in the same manner as animals learn those
of man. Moreover, when a child cries or laughs, he knows in a general
manner what he is doing and what he feels; so that a very small exertion
of reason would tell him what crying or laughing meant in others. But
the question is, do our children acquire their knowledge of expression
solely by experience through the power of association and reason?

As most of the movements of expression must have been gradually
acquired, afterwards becoming instinctive, there seems to be some degree
of _a priori_ probability that their recognition would likewise have
become instinctive. There is, at least, no greater difficulty in
believing this than in admitting that, when a female quadruped first
bears young, she knows the cry of distress of her offspring, or than
in admitting that many animals instinctively recognize and fear their
enemies; and of both these statements there can be no reasonable
doubt. It is however extremely difficult to prove that our children
instinctively recognize any expression. I attended to this point in my
first-born infant, who could not have learnt anything by associating
with other children, and I was convinced that he understood a smile and
received pleasure from seeing one, answering it by another, at much too
early an age to have learnt anything by experience. When this child
was about four months old, I made in his presence many odd noises and
strange grimaces, and tried to look savage; but the noises, if not
too loud, as well as the grimaces, were all taken as good jokes; and I
attributed this at the time to their being preceded or accompanied by
smiles. When five months old, he seemed to understand a compassionate,
expression and tone of voice. When a few days over six months old, his
nurse pretended to cry, and I saw that his face instantly assumed a
melancholy expression, with the corners of the mouth strongly depressed;
now this child could rarely have seen any other child crying, and never
a grown-up person crying, and I should doubt whether at so early an age
he could have reasoned on the subject. Therefore it seems to me that an
innate feeling must have told him that the pretended crying of his nurse
expressed grief; and this through the instinct of sympathy excited grief
in him.

M. Lemoine argues that, if man possessed an innate knowledge of
expression, authors and artists would not have found it so difficult, as
is notoriously the case, to describe and depict the characteristic signs
of each particular state of mind. But this does not seem to me a
valid argument. We may actually behold the expression changing in an
unmistakable manner in a man or animal, and yet be quite unable, as I
know from experience, to analyse the nature of the change. In the two
photographs given by Duchenne of the same old man (Plate III. figs. 5
and 6), almost every one recognized that the one represented a true, and
the other a false smile; but I have found it very difficult to decide in
what the whole amount of difference consists. It has often struck me
as a curious fact that so many shades of expression are instantly
recognized without any conscious process of analysis on our part. No
one, I believe, can clearly describe a sullen or sly expression; yet
many observers are unanimous that these expressions can be recognized
in the various races of man. Almost everyone to whom I showed Duchenne's
photograph of the young man with oblique eyebrows (Plate II. fig. 2) at
once declared that it expressed grief or some such feeling; yet probably
not one of these persons, or one out of a thousand persons, could
beforehand have told anything precise about the obliquity of the
eyebrows with their inner ends puckered, or about the rectangular
furrows on the forehead. So it is with many other expressions, of which
I have had practical experience in the trouble requisite in instructing
others what points to observe. If, then, great ignorance of details
does not prevent our recognizing with certainty and promptitude various
expressions, I do not see how this ignorance can be advanced as an
argument that our knowledge, though vague and general, is not innate.

I have endeavoured to show in considerable detail that all the chief
expressions exhibited by man are the same throughout the world. This
fact is interesting, as it affords a new argument in favour of the
several races being descended from a single parent-stock, which must
have been almost completely human in structure, and to a large extent in
mind, before the period at which the races diverged from each other. No
doubt similar structures, adapted for the same purpose, have often
been independently acquired through variation and natural selection
by distinct species; but this view will not explain close similarity
between distinct species in a multitude of unimportant details. Now if
we bear in mind the numerous points of structure having no relation to
expression, in which all the races of man closely agree, and then add to
them the numerous points, some of the highest importance and many of the
most trifling value, on which the movements of expression directly or
indirectly depend, it seems to me improbable in the highest degree that
so much similarity, or rather identity of structure, could have been
acquired by independent means. Yet this must have been the case if the
races of man are descended from several aboriginally distinct species.
It is far more probable that the many points of close similarity in the
various races are due to inheritance from a single parent-form, which
had already assumed a human character.

It is a curious, though perhaps an idle speculation, how early in the
long line of our progenitors the various expressive movements, now
exhibited by man, were successively acquired. The following remarks
will at least serve to recall some of the chief points discussed in this
volume. We may confidently believe that laughter, as a sign of pleasure
or enjoyment, was practised by our progenitors long before they deserved
to be called human; for very many kinds of monkeys, when pleased, utter
a reiterated sound, clearly analogous to our laughter, often accompanied
by vibratory movements of their jaws or lips, with the corners of the
mouth drawn backwards and upwards, by the wrinkling of the cheeks, and
even by the brightening of the eyes.

We may likewise infer that fear was expressed from an extremely remote
period, in almost the same manner as it now is by man; namely, by
trembling, the erection of the hair, cold perspiration, pallor, widely
opened eyes, the relaxation of most of the muscles, and by the whole
body cowering downwards or held motionless.

Suffering, if great, will from the first have caused screams or groans
to be uttered, the body to be contorted, and the teeth to be ground
together. But our progenitors will not have exhibited those highly
expressive movements of the features which accompany screaming and
crying until their circulatory and respiratory organs, and the muscles
surrounding the eyes, had acquired their present structure. The shedding
of tears appears to have originated through reflex action from the
spasmodic contraction of the eyelids, together perhaps with the eyeballs
becoming gorged with blood during the act of screaming. Therefore
weeping probably came on rather late in the line of our descent; and
this conclusion agrees with the fact that our nearest allies, the
anthropomorphous apes, do not weep. But we must here exercise some
caution, for as certain monkeys, which are not closely related to man,
weep, this habit might have been developed long ago in a sub-branch
of the group from which man is derived. Our early progenitors, when
suffering from grief or anxiety, would not have made their eyebrows
oblique, or have drawn down the corners of their mouth, until they
had acquired the habit of endeavouring to restrain their screams. The
expression, therefore, of grief and anxiety is eminently human.

Rage will have been expressed at a very early period by threatening or
frantic gestures, by the reddening of the skin, and by glaring eyes, but
not by frowning. For the habit of frowning seems to have been acquired
chiefly from the corrugators being the first muscles to contract round
the eyes, whenever during infancy pain, anger, or distress is felt, and
there consequently is a near approach to screaming; and partly from
a frown serving as a shade in difficult and intent vision. It seems
probable that this shading action would not have become habitual until
man had assumed a completely upright position, for monkeys do not frown
when exposed to a glaring light. Our early progenitors, when enraged,
would probably have exposed their teeth more freely than does man, even
when giving full vent to his rage, as with the insane. We may, also,
feel almost certain that they would have protruded their lips, when
sulky or disappointed, in a greater degree than is the case with our own
children, or even with the children of existing savage races.

Our early progenitors, when indignant or moderately angry, would
not have held their heads erect, opened their chests, squared their
shoulders, and clenched their fists, until they had acquired the
ordinary carriage and upright attitude of man, and had learnt to
fight with their fists or clubs. Until this period had arrived the
antithetical gesture of shrugging the shoulders, as a sign of impotence
or of patience, would not have been developed. From the same reason
astonishment would not then have been expressed by raising the arms
with open hands and extended fingers. Nor, judging from the actions
of monkeys, would astonishment have been exhibited by a widely opened
mouth; but the eyes would have been opened and the eyebrows arched.
Disgust would have been shown at a very early period by movements round
the mouth, like those of vomiting,--that is, if the view which I have
suggested respecting the source of the expression is correct, namely,
that our progenitors had the power, and used it, of voluntarily and
quickly rejecting any food from their stomachs which they disliked. But
the more refined manner of showing contempt or disdain, by lowering the
eyelids, or turning away the eyes and face, as if the despised person
were not worth looking at, would not probably have been acquired until a
much later period.

Of all expressions, blushing seems to be the most strictly human; yet
it is common to all or nearly all the races of man, whether or not any
change of colour is visible in their skin. The relaxation of the small
arteries of the surface, on which blushing depends, seems to have
primarily resulted from earnest attention directed to the appearance of
our own persons, especially of our faces, aided by habit, inheritance,
and the ready flow of nerve-force along accustomed channels; and
afterwards to have been extended by the power of association to
self-attention directed to moral conduct. It can hardly be doubted that
many animals are capable of appreciating beautiful colours and even
forms, as is shown by the pains which the individuals of one sex take
in displaying their beauty before those of the opposite sex. But it
does not seem possible that any animal, until its mental powers had been
developed to an equal or nearly equal degree with those of man, would
have closely considered and been sensitive about its own personal
appearance. Therefore we may conclude that blushing originated at a very
late period in the long line of our descent.

From the various facts just alluded to, and given in the course of this
volume, it follows that, if the structure of our organs of respiration
and circulation had differed in only a slight degree from the state
in which they now exist, most of our expressions would have been
wonderfully different. A very slight change in the course of the
arteries and veins which run to the head, would probably have prevented
the blood from accumulating in our eyeballs during violent expiration;
for this occurs in extremely few quadrupeds. In this case we should not
have displayed some of our most characteristic expressions. If man had
breathed water by the aid of external branchiae (though the idea is
hardly conceivable), instead of air through his mouth and nostrils, his
features would not have expressed his feelings much more efficiently
than now do his hands or limbs. Rage and disgust, however, would still
have been shown by movements about the lips and mouth, and the eyes
would have become brighter or duller according to the state of the
circulation. If our ears had remained movable, their movements would
have been highly expressive, as is the case with all the animals which
fight with their teeth; and we may infer that our early progenitors thus
fought, as we still uncover the canine tooth on one side when we sneer
at or defy any one, and we uncover all our teeth when furiously enraged.


The movements of expression in the face and body, whatever their origin
may have been, are in themselves of much importance for our welfare.
They serve as the first means of communication between the mother and
her infant; she smiles approval, and thus encourages her child on the
right path, or frowns disapproval. We readily perceive sympathy in
others by their expression; our sufferings are thus mitigated and our
pleasures increased; and mutual good feeling is thus strengthened. The
movements of expression give vividness and energy to our spoken words.
They reveal the thoughts and intentions of others more truly than do
words, which may be falsified. Whatever amount of truth the so-called
science of physiognomy may contain, appears to depend, as Haller long
ago remarked,[1404] on different persons bringing into frequent
use different facial muscles, according to their dispositions; the
development of these muscles being perhaps thus increased, and the lines
or furrows on the face, due to their habitual contraction, being thus
rendered deeper and more conspicuous. The free expression by outward
signs of an emotion intensifies it. On the other hand, the repression,
as far as this is possible, of all outward signs softens our
emotions.[1405] He who gives way to violent gestures will increase his
rage; he who does not control the signs of fear will experience fear in
a greater degree; and he who remains passive when overwhelmed with grief
loses his best chance of recovering elasticity of mind. These results
follow partly from the intimate relation which exists between almost
all the emotions and their outward manifestations; and partly from
the direct influence of exertion on the heart, and consequently on
the brain. Even the simulation of an emotion tends to arouse it in our
minds. Shakespeare, who from his wonderful knowledge of the human mind
ought to be an excellent judge, says:--

      Is it not monstrous that this player here,
      But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
      Could force his soul so to his own conceit,
      That, from her working, all his visage wann'd;
      Tears in his eyes, distraction in 's aspect,
      A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
      With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
     _Hamlet_, act ii. sc. 2.


We have seen that the study of the theory of expression confirms to
a certain limited extent the conclusion that man is derived from
some lower animal form, and supports the belief of the specific or
sub-specific unity of the several races; but as far as my judgment
serves, such confirmation was hardly needed. We have also seen that
expression in itself, or the language of the emotions, as it has
sometimes been called, is certainly of importance for the welfare of
mankind. To understand, as far as possible, the source or origin of the
various expressions which may be hourly seen on the faces of the men
around us, not to mention our domesticated animals, ought to possess
much interest for us. From these several causes, we may conclude that
the philosophy of our subject has well deserved the attention which
it has already received from several excellent observers, and that it
deserves still further attention, especially from any able physiologist.

Domestication,' vol. ii. p. 6. The inheritance of habitual gestures
is so important for us, that I gladly avail myself of Mr. F. Galton's
permission to give in his own words the following remarkable case:--"The
following account of a habit occurring in individuals of three
consecutive generations {footnote continues:} is of peculiar interest,
because it occurs only during sound sleep, and therefore cannot be
due to imitation, but must be altogether natural. The particulars are
perfectly trustworthy, for I have enquired fully into them, and speak
from abundant and independent evidence. A gentleman of considerable
position was found by his wife to have the curious trick, when he lay
fast asleep on his back in bed, of raising his right arm slowly in front
of his face, up to his forehead, and then dropping it with a jerk, so
that the wrist fell heavily on the bridge of his nose. The trick did
not occur every night, but occasionally, and was independent of any
ascertained cause. Sometimes it was repeated incessantly for an hour or
more. The gentleman's nose was prominent, and its bridge often became
sore from the blows which it received. At one time an awkward sore was
produced, that was long in healing, on account of the recurrence, night
after night, of the blows which first caused it. His wife had to remove
the button from the wrist of his night-gown as it made severe scratches,
and some means were attempted of tying his arm.

"Many years after his death, his son married a lady who had never
heard of the family incident. She, however, observed precisely the same
peculiarity in her husband; but his nose, from not being particularly
prominent, has never as yet suffered from the blows. The trick does
not occur when he is half-asleep, as, for example, when dozing in his
arm-chair, but the moment he is fast asleep it is apt to begin. It is,
as with his father, intermittent; sometimes ceasing for many nights,
and sometimes almost incessant during a part of every night. It is
performed, as it was by his father, with his right hand.

"One of his children, a girl, has inherited the same trick. She performs
it, likewise, with the right hand, but in a slightly modified form; for,
after raising the arm, she does not allow the wrist to drop upon the
bridge of the nose, but the palm of the half-closed hand falls over and
down the nose, striking it rather rapidly. It is also very intermittent
with this child, not occurring for periods of some months, but sometimes
occurring almost incessantly."]

p. 305) that reflex actions proper to the spinal cord are NATURAL;
but, by the help of the brain, that is through habit, an infinity of
ARTIFICIAL reflex actions may be acquired. Virchow admits ('Sammlung

and, of the latter, it may be added, some cannot be distinguished from
inherited habits.]

by a telegram that a fortune had been bequeathed him, first became pale,
then exhilarated, and soon in the highest spirits, but flushed and
very restless. He then took a walk with a friend for the sake
of tranquillising himself, but returned staggering in his gait,
uproariously laughing, yet irritable in temper, incessantly talking, and
singing loudly in the public streets. It was positively ascertained that
he had not touched any spirituous liquor, though every one thought that
he was intoxicated. Vomiting after a time came on, and the half-digested
contents of his stomach were examined, but no odour of alcohol could be
detected. He then slept heavily, and on awaking was well, except that he
suffered from headache, nausea, and prostration of strength.]

collapsed muscles and dulled eyes. As associated habit no longer
prompts the sufferer to action, he is urged by his friends to voluntary
exertion, and not to give way to silent, motionless grief. Exertion
stimulates the heart, and this reacts on the brain, and aids the mind to
bear its heavy load.]

[Footnote 427: The 'American Naturalist,' Jan. 1872, p. 32. I regret
that I cannot follow Prof. Shaler in believing that the rattle has been
developed, by the aid of natural selection, for the sake of producing
sounds which deceive and attract birds, so that they may serve as prey
to the snake. I do not, however, wish to doubt that the sounds may
occasionally subserve this end. But the conclusion at which I have
arrived, viz. that the rattling serves as a warning to would-be
devourers, appears to me much more probable, as it connects together
various classes of facts. If this snake had acquired its rattle and the
habit of rattling, for the sake of attracting prey, it does not seem
probable that it would have invariably used its instrument when angered
or disturbed. Prof. Shaler takes nearly the same view as I do of the
manner of development of the rattle; and I have always held this opinion
since observing the Trigonocephalus in South America.]

[Footnote 428: From the accounts lately collected, and given in the
'Journal of the Linnean Society,' by Airs. Barber, on the habits of
the snakes of South Africa; and from the accounts published by
several writers, for instance by Lawson, of the rattle-snake in North
America,--it does not seem improbable that the terrific appearance of
snakes and the sounds produced by them, may likewise serve in procuring
prey, by paralysing, or as it is sometimes called fascinating, the
smaller animals.]

[Footnote 429: See the account by Dr. R. Brown, in Proc. Zool. Soc.

[Footnote 602: Henle ('Handbuch d. Syst. Anat. 1858, B. i. s. 139)
agrees with Duchenne that this is the effect of the contraction of the
_pyramidalis nasi_.]

[Footnote 603: These consist of the _levator labii superioris alaeque
nasi_, the _levator labii proprius_, the _malaris_, and the _zygomaticus
minor_, or little zygomatic. This latter muscle runs parallel to and
above the great zygomatic, and is attached to the outer part of the
upper lip. It is represented in fig. 2 (I. p. 24), but not in figs. 1
and 3. Dr. Duchenne first showed ('Mecanisme de la Physionomie Humaine,'
Album, 1862, p. 39) the importance of the contraction of this muscle
in the shape assumed by the features in crying. Henle considers the
above-named muscles (excepting the _malaris_) as subdivisions of the
_quadratus labii superioris_.]

[Footnote 604: Although Dr. Duchenne has so carefully studied the
contraction of the different muscles during the act of crying, and
the furrows on the face thus produced, there seems to be something
incomplete in his account; but what this is I cannot say. He has given
a figure (Album, fig. 48) in which one half of the face is made, by
galvanizing the proper muscles, to smile; whilst the other half is
similarly made to begin crying. Almost all those (viz. nineteen out
of twenty-one persons) to whom I showed the smiling half of the face
instantly recognized the expression; but, with respect to the other
half, only six persons out of twenty-one recognized it,--that is, if
we accept such terms as "grief," "misery," "annoyance," as
correct;--whereas, fifteen persons were ludicrously mistaken; some
of them saying the face expressed "fun," "satisfaction," "cunning,"
"disgust," &c. We may infer from this that there is something wrong
in the expression. Some of the fifteen persons may, however, have been
partly misled by not expecting to see an old man crying, and by tears
not being secreted. With respect to another figure by Dr. Duchenne (fig.
49), in which the muscles of half the face are galvanized in order to
represent a man beginning to cry, with the eyebrow on the same side
rendered oblique, which is characteristic of misery, the expression
was recognized by a greater proportional number of persons. Out of
twenty-three persons, fourteen answered correctly, "sorrow," "distress,"
"grief," "just going to cry," "endurance of pain," &c. On the other
hand, nine persons either could form no opinion or were entirely wrong,
answering, "cunning leer," "jocund," "looking at an intense light,"
"looking at a distant object," &c.]

[Footnote 616: Prof. Donders remarks (ibid. p. 28), that, "After
injury to the eye, after operations, and in some forms of internal
inflammation, we attach great value to the uniform support of the closed
eyelids, and we increase this in many instances by the application of a
bandage. In both cases we carefully endeavour to avoid great expiratory
pressure, the disadvantage of which is well known." Mr. Bowman informs
me that in the excessive photophobia, accompanying what is called
scrofulous ophthalmia in children, when the light is so very painful
that during weeks or months it is constantly excluded by the most
forcible closure of the lids, he has often been struck on opening the
lids by the paleness of the eye,--not an unnatural paleness, but an
absence of the redness that might have been expected when the surface is
somewhat inflamed, as is then usually the case; and this paleness he is
inclined to attribute to the forcible closure of the eyelids.]

[Footnote 618: Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood (Dict. of English Etymology, 1859,

[Footnote 620: 'Ceylon,' 3rd edit. 1859, vol. ii. pp. 364, 376. I
applied to Mr. Thwaites, in Ceylon, for further information with respect
to the weeping of the elephant; and in consequence received a letter
from the Rev. Mr Glenie, who, with others, kindly observed for me a
herd of recently captured elephants. These, when irritated, screamed
violently; but it is remarkable that they never when thus screaming
contracted the muscles round the eyes. Nor did they shed tears; and the
native hunters asserted that they had never observed elephants weeping.
Nevertheless, it appears to me impossible to doubt Sir E. Tennent's
distinct details about their weeping, supported as they are by the
positive assertion of the keeper in the Zoological Gardens. It is
certain that the two elephants in the Gardens, when they began to
trumpet loudly, invariably contracted their orbicular muscles. I can
reconcile these conflicting statements only by supposing that the
recently captured elephants in Ceylon, from being enraged or frightened,
desired to observe their persecutors, and consequently did not contract
their orbicular muscles, so that their vision might not be impeded.
Those seen weeping by Sir E. Tennent were prostrate, and had given up
the contest in despair. The elephants which trumpeted in the Zoological
Gardens at the word of command, were, of course, neither alarmed nor
enraged.]

[Footnote 703: In the foregoing remarks on the manner in which the
eyebrows are made oblique, I have followed what seems to be the
universal opinion of all the anatomists, whose works I have consulted
on the action of the above-named muscles, or with whom I have conversed.
Hence throughout this work I shall take a similar view of the action of
the corrugator supercilii, orbicularis, pyramidalis nasi, and frontalis
muscles. Dr. Duchenne, however, believes, and every conclusion at which
he arrives deserves serious consideration, that it is the corrugator,
called by him the sourcilier, which raises the inner corner of the
eyebrows and is antagonistic to the upper and inner part of the
orbicular muscle, as well as to the pyramidalis nasi (see Mécanisme
de la Phys. Humaine, 1862, folio, art. v., text and figures 19 to 29:
octavo edit. 1862, p. 43 text). He admits, however, that the corrugator
draws together the eyebrows, causing vertical furrows above the base
of the nose, or a frown. He further believes that towards the outer
two-thirds of the eyebrow the corrugator acts in conjunction with the
upper orbicular muscle; both here standing in antagonism to the frontal
muscle. I am unable to understand, judging from Henle's drawings
(woodcut, fig. 3), how the corrugator can act in the manner described
by Duchenne. See, also, on this subject, Prof. Donders' remarks in the
'Archives of Medicine,' 1870, vol. v. p. 34. Mr. J. Wood, who is so well
known for his careful study of the muscles of the human frame, informs
me that he believes the account which I have given of the action of the
corrugator to be correct. But this is not a point of any importance
with respect to the expression which is caused by the obliquity of the
eyebrows, nor of much importance to the theory of its origin.]

[Footnote 901: 'Anatomy of Expression,' pp. 137, 139. It is not
surprising that the corrugators should have become much more developed
in man than in the anthropoid apes; for they are brought into
incessant action by him under various circumstances, and will have been
strengthened and modified by the inherited effects of use. We have
seen how important a part they play, together with the orbiculares, in
protecting the eyes from being too much gorged with blood during
violent expiratory movements. When the eyes are closed as quickly and
as forcibly as possible, to save them from being injured by a blow,
the corrugators contract. With savages or other men whose heads are
uncovered, the eyebrows are continually lowered and contracted to serve
as a shade against a too strong light; and this is effected partly
by the corrugators. This movement would have been more especially
serviceable to man, as soon as his early progenitors held their heads
erect. Lastly, Prof. Donders believes ('Archives of Medicine,' ed. by
L. Beale, 1870, vol. v. p. 34), that the corrugators are brought into
action in causing the eyeball to advance in accommodation for proximity
in vision.]

hardly deserves to be called an explanation.]

other hand, Dr. Burgess ('Physiology of Blushing,' 1839, p. 31) speaks
of the reddening of a cicatrix in a negress as of the nature of a
blush.]

[Footnote 1004: Moreau and Gratiolet have discussed the colour of the
face under the influence of intense passion: see the edit. of 1820 of
Lavater, vol. iv. pp. 282 and 300; and Gratiolet, 'De la Physionomie,'
p. 345.]

[Footnote 1005: Sir C. Bell 'Anatomy of Expression,' pp. 91, 107, has
fully discussed this subject. Moreau remarks (in the edit. of 1820 of
'La Physionomie, par G. Lavater,' vol. iv. p. 237), and quotes Portal
in confirmation, that asthmatic patients acquire permanently expanded
nostrils, owing to the habitual contraction of the elevatory muscles
of the wings of the nose. The explanation by Dr. Piderit ('Mimik und
Physiognomik,' s. 82) of the distension of the nostrils, namely, to
allow free breathing whilst the mouth is closed and the teeth clenched,
does not appear to be nearly so correct as that by Sir C. Bell, who
attributes it to the sympathy (_i. e_. habitual co-action) of all the
respiratory muscles. The nostrils of an angry man may be seen to become
dilated, although his mouth is open.]

[Footnote 1006: Mr. Wedgwood, 'On the Origin of Language,' 1866, p. 76.
He also observes that the sound of hard breathing "is represented by the
syllables _puff, huff, whiff_, whence a _huff_ is a fit of ill-temper."]

[Footnote 1007: Sir C. Bell 'Anatomy of Expression,' p. 95) has some
excellent remarks on the expression of rage.]

[Footnote 1008: 'De la Physionomie,' 1865, p. 346.]

[Footnote 1009: Sir C. Bell, 'Anatomy of Expression,' p. 177. Gratiolet
(De la Phys. p. 369) says, 'les dents se decouvrent, et imitent
symboliquement l'action de dechirer et de mordre.'I If, instead of using
the vague term _symboliquement_, Gratiolet had said that the action was
a remnant of a habit acquired during primeval times when our semi-human
progenitors fought together with their teeth, like gorillas and orangs
at the present day, he would have been more intelligible. Dr. Piderit
('Mimik,' &c., s. 82) also speaks of the retraction of the upper lip
during rage. In an engraving of one of Hogarth's wonderful pictures,
passion is represented in the plainest manner by the open glaring eyes,
frowning forehead, and exposed grinning teeth.]

('La Physionomie, par Lavater,' edit. of 1820, vol. lx. p. 268), remarks
that anger is expressed by the clenching of the fists. See, to the same
effect, Huschke, 'Mimices et Physiognomices, Fragmentum Physiologicum,'

Gratiolet also speaks (De la Phys. 1865, p. 52) of the turning away of
the eyes and body.]

[Footnote 1103: Dr. W. Ogle, in an interesting paper on the Sense of
Smell ('Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,' vol. liii. p. 268), shows
that when we wish to smell carefully, instead of taking one deep nasal
inspiration, we draw in the air by a succession of rapid short sniffs.
If "the nostrils be watched during this process, it will be seen
that, so far from dilating, they actually contract at each sniff. The
contraction does not include the whole anterior opening, but only the
posterior portion." He then explains the cause of this movement. When,
on the other hand, we wish to exclude any odour, the contraction, I
presume, affects only the anterior part of the nostrils.]

[Footnote 1104: 'Mimik und Physiognomik,' ss. 84, 93. Gratiolet (ibid.
p. 155) takes nearly the same view with Dr. Piderit respecting the
expression of contempt and disgust.]

[Footnote 1105: Scorn implies a strong form of contempt; and one of the
roots of the word 'scorn' means, according to Mr. Wedgwood (Dict. of
English Etymology, vol. iii. p. 125), ordure or dirt. A person who is
scorned is treated like dirt.]

[Footnote 1108: Duchenne believes that in the eversion of the lower lip,
the corners are drawn downwards by the _depressores anguli oris_. Henle
(Handbuch d. Anat. des Menschen, 1858, B. i. s. 151) concludes that this
is effected by the _musculus quadratus menti_.]

[Footnote 1216: Mr. Bain ('The Emotions and the Will,' 1865, p. 54)
explains in the following manner the origin of the custom "of subjecting
criminals in India to the ordeal of the morsel of rice. The accused is
made to take a mouthful of rice, and after a little time to throw
it out. If the morsel is quite dry, the party is believed to be
guilty,--his own evil conscience operating to paralyse the salivating
organs."]

[Footnote 1223: Ducheinne takes, in fact, this view (ibid. p. 45), as
he attributes the contraction of the platysma to the shivering of fear
(_frisson de la peur_); but he elsewhere compares the action with that
which causes the hair of frightened quadrupeds to stand erect; and this
can hardly be considered as quite correct.]

to have probably given rise to many words, such as _ugly, huge_, &c.]

women blushing more freely than men, as stated below.]

[Footnote 1310: 'Letters from Egypt,' 1865, p. 66. Lady Gordon is
mistaken when she says Malays and Mulattoes never blush.]

[Footnote 1311: Capt. Osborn ('Quedah,' p. 199), in speaking of a Malay,
whom he reproached for cruelty, says he was glad to see that the man
blushed.]

[Footnote 1312: J. R. Forster, 'Observations during a Voyage round the
World,' 4to, 1778, p. 229. Waitz gives ('Introduction to Anthropology,'
Eng. translat. 1863, vol. i. p. 135) references for other islands in the
Pacific. See, also, Dampier 'On the Blushing of the Tunquinese' (vol.
ii. p. 40); but I have not consulted this work. Waitz quotes Bergmann,
that the Kalmucks do not blush, but this may be doubted after what we
have seen with respect to the Chinese. He also quotes Roth, who denies
that the Abyssinians are capable of blushing. Unfortunately, Capt.
Speedy, who lived so long with the Abyssinians, has not answered my
inquiry on this head. Lastly, I must add that the Rajah Brooke has never
observed the least sign of a blush with the Dyaks of Borneo; on the
contrary under circumstances which would excite a blush in us, they
assert "that they feel the blood drawn from their faces."]

a Madagascar negress-slave when forced by her brutal master to exhibit
her naked bosom.]

[Footnote 1318: Burgess, ibid. p. 31. On mulattoes blushing, see p. 33.
I have received similar accounts with respect to, mulattoes.]

[Footnote 1319: Barrington also says that the Australians of New South
Wales blush, as quoted by Waitz, ibid. p. 135.]

[Footnote 1320: Mr. Wedgwood says (Dict. of English Etymology, vol. iii.
1865, p. 155) that the word shame "may well originate in the idea of
shade or concealment, and may be illustrated by the Low German _scheme_,
shade or shadow." Gratiolet (De la Phys. pp. 357-362) has a good
discussion on the gestures accompanying shame; but some of his remarks
seem to me rather fanciful. See, also, Burgess (ibid. pp. 69, 134) on
the same subject.]

[Footnote 1321: Burgess, ibid. pp. 181, 182. Boerhaave also noticed
(as quoted by Gratiolet, ibid. p. 361) the tendency to the secretion of
tears during intense blushing. Mr. Bulmer, as we have seen, speaks of
the "watery eyes" of the children of the Australian aborigines when
ashamed.]

sexes.... from the influence of mutual regard, by the apprehension on
either side of not standing well with the other."]

&c., vol. ii. pp. 71, 341.]

184. So with the Latin word _verecundus_.]

[Footnote 1328: Mr. Bain ('The Emotions and the Will,' p. 64) has
discussed the "abashed" feelings experienced on these occasions, as well
as the _stage-fright_ of actors unused to the stage. Mr. Bain apparently
attributes these feelings to simple apprehension or dread.]

[Footnote 1329: 'Essays on Practical Education,' by Maria and R. L.
Edgeworth, new edit. vol. ii. 1822, p. 38. Dr. Burgess (ibid. p. 187)

[Footnote 1333: In England, Sir H. Holland was, I believe, the first to
consider the influence of mental attention on various parts of the body,
in his 'Medical Notes and Reflections,' 1839 p. 64. This essay, much
enlarged, was reprinted by Sir H. Holland in his 'Chapters on Mental
Physiology,' 1858, p. 79, from which work I always quote. At nearly the
same time, as well as subsequently, Prof. Laycock discussed the same
subject: see 'Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal,' 1839, July, pp.
17-22. Also his 'Treatise on the Nervous Diseases of Women,' 1840, p.
110; and 'Mind and Brain,' vol. ii. 1860, p. 327. Dr. Carpenter's views
on mesmerism have a nearly similar bearing. The great physiologist
Muller treated ('Elements of Physiology,' Eng. translat. vol. ii. pp.
937, 1085) of the influence of the attention on the senses. Sir J. Paget
discusses the influence of the mind on the nutrition of parts, in his
'Lectures on Surgical Pathology,' 1853, vol. i. p. 39: 1 quote from the
3rd edit. revised by Prof. Turner, 1870, p. 28. See, also, Gratiolet, De

[Footnote 1340: Dr. Maudsley has given ('The Physiology and Pathology
of Mind,' 2nd edit. 1868, p. 105), on good authority, some curious
statements with respect to the improvement of the sense of touch by
practice and attention. It is remarkable that when this sense has thus
been rendered more acute at any point of the body, for instance, in
a finger, it is likewise improved at the corresponding point on the
opposite side of the body.]

THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF CHARLES DARWIN

By Charles Darwin


Including An Autobiographical Chapter


Edited By His Son Francis Darwin




VOLUME I




PREFACE

In choosing letters for publication I have been largely guided by the
wish to illustrate my father's personal character. But his life was so
essentially one of work, that a history of the man could not be written
without following closely the career of the author. Thus it comes
about that the chief part of the book falls into chapters whose titles
correspond to the names of his books.

In arranging the letters I have adhered as far as possible to
chronological sequence, but the character and variety of his researches
make a strictly chronological order an impossibility. It was his habit
to work more or less simultaneously at several subjects. Experimental
work was often carried on as a refreshment or variety, while books
entailing reasoning and the marshalling of large bodies of facts were
being written. Moreover, many of his researches were allowed to
drop, and only resumed after an interval of years. Thus a rigidly
chronological series of letters would present a patchwork of subjects,
each of which would be difficult to follow. The Table of Contents will
show in what way I have attempted to avoid this result.

In printing the letters I have followed (except in a few cases) the
usual plan of indicating the existence of omissions or insertions. My
father's letters give frequent evidence of having been written when he
was tired or hurried, and they bear the marks of this circumstance. In
writing to a friend, or to one of his family, he frequently omitted the
articles: these have been inserted without the usual indications, except
in a few instances, where it is of special interest to preserve intact
the hurried character of the letter. Other small words, such as "of",
"to", etc., have been inserted usually within brackets. I have not
followed the originals as regards the spelling of names, the use of
capitals, or in the matter of punctuation. My father underlined many
words in his letters; these have not always been given in italics,--a
rendering which would unfairly exaggerate their effect.

The Diary or Pocket-book, from which quotations occur in the following
pages, has been of value as supplying a frame-work of facts round which
letters may be grouped. It is unfortunately written with great brevity,
the history of a year being compressed into a page or less; and contains
little more than the dates of the principal events of his life, together
with entries as to his work, and as to the duration of his more serious
illnesses. He rarely dated his letters, so that but for the Diary it
would have been all but impossible to unravel the history of his books.
It has also enabled me to assign dates to many letters which would
otherwise have been shorn of half their value.

Of letters addressed to my father I have not made much use. It was his
custom to file all letters received, and when his slender stock of files
("spits" as he called them) was exhausted, he would burn the letters of
several years, in order that he might make use of the liberated "spits."
This process, carried on for years, destroyed nearly all letters
received before 1862. After that date he was persuaded to keep the more
interesting letters, and these are preserved in an accessible form.

I have attempted to give, in Chapter III., some account of his manner
of working. During the last eight years of his life I acted as his
assistant, and thus had an opportunity of knowing something of his
habits and methods.

I have received much help from my friends in the course of my work.
To some I am indebted for reminiscences of my father, to others for
information, criticisms, and advice. To all these kind coadjutors
I gladly acknowledge my indebtedness. The names of some occur in
connection with their contributions, but I do not name those to whom I
am indebted for criticisms or corrections, because I should wish to bear
alone the load of my short-comings, rather than to let any of it fall on
those who have done their best to lighten it.

It will be seen how largely I am indebted to Sir Joseph Hooker for the
means of illustrating my father's life. The readers of these pages
will, I think, be grateful to Sir Joseph for the care with which he has
preserved his valuable collection of letters, and I should wish to add
my acknowledgment of the generosity with which he has placed it at my
disposal, and for the kindly encouragement given throughout my work.

To Mr. Huxley I owe a debt of thanks, not only for much kind help, but
for his willing compliance with my request that he should contribute a
chapter on the reception of the 'Origin of Species.'

Finally, it is a pleasure to acknowledge the courtesy of the publishers
of the 'Century Magazine' who have freely given me the use of their
illustrations. To Messrs. Maull and Fox and Messrs. Elliott and Fry I am
also indebted for their kindness in allowing me the use of reproductions
of their photographs.

LIFE AND LETTERS OF CHARLES DARWIN.




VOLUME I.




CHAPTER 1.I. -- THE DARWIN FAMILY.

The earliest records of the family show the Darwins to have been
substantial yeomen residing on the northern borders of Lincolnshire,
close to Yorkshire. The name is now very unusual in England, but I
believe that it is not unknown in the neighbourhood of Sheffield and in
Lancashire. Down to the year 1600 we find the name spelt in a variety
of ways--Derwent, Darwen, Darwynne, etc. It is possible, therefore, that
the family migrated at some unknown date from Yorkshire, Cumberland, or
Derbyshire, where Derwent occurs as the name of a river.

The first ancestor of whom we know was one William Darwin, who lived,
about the year 1500, at Marton, near Gainsborough. His great grandson,
Richard Darwyn, inherited land at Marton and elsewhere, and in his will,
dated 1584, "bequeathed the sum of 3s. 4d. towards the settynge up of
the Queene's Majestie's armes over the quearie (choir) doore in the
parishe churche of Marton." (We owe a knowledge of these earlier members
of the family to researches amongst the wills at Lincoln, made by the
well-known genealogist, Colonel Chester.)

The son of this Richard, named William Darwin, and described as
"gentleman," appears to have been a successful man. Whilst retaining his
ancestral land at Marton, he acquired through his wife and by purchase
an estate at Cleatham, in the parish of Manton, near Kirton Lindsey, and
fixed his residence there. This estate remained in the family down
to the year 1760. A cottage with thick walls, some fish-ponds and old
trees, now alone show where the "Old Hall" once stood, and a field is
still locally known as the "Darwin Charity," from being subject to a
charge in favour of the poor of Marton. William Darwin must, at least in
part, have owed his rise in station to his appointment in 1613 by James
I. to the post of Yeoman of the Royal Armoury of Greenwich. The office
appears to have been worth only 33 pounds a year, and the duties were
probably almost nominal; he held the post down to his death during the
Civil Wars.

The fact that this William was a royal servant may explain why his
son, also named William, served when almost a boy for the King, as
"Captain-Lieutenant" in Sir William Pelham's troop of horse. On the
partial dispersion of the royal armies, and the retreat of the remainder
to Scotland, the boy's estates were sequestrated by the Parliament, but
they were redeemed on his signing the Solemn League and Covenant, and on
his paying a fine which must have struck his finances severely; for in
a petition to Charles II. he speaks of his almost utter ruin from having
adhered to the royal cause.

During the Commonwealth, William Darwin became a barrister of Lincoln's
Inn, and this circumstance probably led to his marriage with the
daughter of Erasmus Earle, serjeant-at-law; hence his great-grandson,
Erasmus Darwin, the Poet, derived his Christian name. He ultimately
became Recorder of the city of Lincoln.

The eldest son of the Recorder, again called William, was born in
1655, and married the heiress of Robert Waring, a member of a good
Staffordshire family. This lady inherited from the family of Lassells,
or Lascelles, the manor and hall of Elston, near Newark, which has
remained ever since in the family. (Captain Lassells, or Lascelles, of
Elston was military secretary to Monk, Duke of Albemarle, during the
Civil Wars. A large volume of account books, countersigned in many
places by Monk, are now in the possession of my cousin Francis Darwin.
The accounts might possibly prove of interest to the antiquarian or
historian. A portrait of Captain Lassells in armour, although used at
one time as an archery-target by some small boys of our name, was not
irretrievably ruined.) A portrait of this William Darwin at Elston shows
him as a good-looking young man in a full-bottomed wig.

This third William had two sons, William, and Robert who was educated
as a barrister. The Cleatham property was left to William, but on the
termination of his line in daughters reverted to the younger brother,
who had received Elston. On his mother's death Robert gave up his
profession and resided ever afterwards at Elston Hall. Of this Robert,
Charles Darwin writes (What follows is quoted from Charles Darwin's
biography of his grandfather, forming the preliminary notice to Ernst
Krause's interesting essay, 'Erasmus Darwin,' London, 1879, page 4.):--

"He seems to have had some taste for science, for he was an early
member of the well-known Spalding Club; and the celebrated antiquary
Dr. Stukeley, in 'An Account of the almost entire Sceleton of a large
Animal,' etc., published in the 'Philosophical Transactions,' April and
May 1719, begins the paper as follows: 'Having an account from my friend
Robert Darwin, Esq., of Lincoln's Inn, a person of curiosity, of a human
sceleton impressed in stone, found lately by the rector of Elston,' etc.
Stukeley then speaks of it as a great rarity, 'the like whereof has not
been observed before in this island to my knowledge.' Judging from a
sort of litany written by Robert, and handed down in the family, he
was a strong advocate of temperance, which his son ever afterwards so
strongly advocated:--

     From a morning that doth shine,
     From a boy that drinketh wine,
     From a wife that talketh Latine,
     Good Lord deliver me!

"It is suspected that the third line may be accounted for by his wife,
the mother of Erasmus, having been a very learned lady. The eldest son
of Robert, christened Robert Waring, succeeded to the estate of Elston,
and died there at the age of ninety-two, a bachelor. He had a strong
taste for poetry, like his youngest brother Erasmus. Robert also
cultivated botany, and, when an oldish man, he published his 'Principia
Botanica.' This book in MS. was beautifully written, and my father [Dr.
R.W. Darwin] declared that he believed it was published because his old
uncle could not endure that such fine caligraphy should be wasted.
But this was hardly just, as the work contains many curious notes on
biology--a subject wholly neglected in England in the last century. The
public, moreover, appreciated the book, as the copy in my possession is
the third edition."

The second son, William Alvey, inherited Elston, and transmitted it to
his granddaughter, the late Mrs. Darwin, of Elston and Creskeld. A third
son, John, became rector of Elston, the living being in the gift of the
family. The fourth son, the youngest child, was Erasmus Darwin, the poet
and philosopher.

TABLE OF RELATIONSHIP. (An incomplete list of family members.)

ROBERT DARWIN of Elston, 1682-1754, had three sons, William Alvey
Darwin, 1726-1783, Robert Waring Darwin, 1724-1816, and Erasmus Darwin,
1731-1802.

William Alvey Darwin, 1726-1783, had a son, William Brown Darwin, 1774-
1841, and a daughter, Anne Darwin.

William Brown Darwin, 1774-1841, had two daughters, Charlotte Darwin and
Sarah Darwin.

Charlotte Darwin married Francis Rhodes, now Francis Darwin of Creskeld
and Elston.

Sarah Darwin married Edward Noel.

Anne Darwin married Samuel Fox and had a son, William Darwin Fox.

ERASMUS DARWIN, 1731-1802, married (1) MARY HOWARD, 1740-1770, with whom
he had two sons, Charles Darwin, 1758-1778, and ROBERT WARING DARWIN,
and (2) Eliz. Chandos-Pole, 1747-1832, with whom he had a daughter,
Violetta Darwin, and a son, Francis Sacheverel Darwin.

ROBERT WARING DARWIN, 1767-1848, married SUSANNAH WEDGWOOD and had a
son, CHARLES ROBERT DARWIN, b. February 12, 1809, d. April 19, 1882.

Violetta Darwin married Samuel Tertius Galton and had a son, Francis
Galton.

Francis Sacheverel Darwin, 1786-1859, had two sons, Reginald Darwin and
Edward Darwin, "High Elms."

The table above shows Charles Darwin's descent from Robert, and his
relationship to some other members of the family, whose names occur in
his correspondence. Among these are included William Darwin Fox, one of
his earliest correspondents, and Francis Galton, with whom he maintained
a warm friendship for many years. Here also occurs the name of Francis
Sacheverel Darwin, who inherited a love of natural history from Erasmus,
and transmitted it to his son Edward Darwin, author (under the name of
"High Elms") of a 'Gamekeeper's Manual' (4th Edition 1863), which shows
keen observation of the habits of various animals.

It is always interesting to see how far a man's personal characteristics
can be traced in his forefathers. Charles Darwin inherited the tall
stature, but not the bulky figure of Erasmus; but in his features
there is no traceable resemblance to those of his grandfather. Nor,
it appears, had Erasmus the love of exercise and of field-sports, so
characteristic of Charles Darwin as a young man, though he had, like
his grandson, an indomitable love of hard mental work. Benevolence and
sympathy with others, and a great personal charm of manner, were common
to the two. Charles Darwin possessed, in the highest degree, that
"vividness of imagination" of which he speaks as strongly characteristic
of Erasmus, and as leading "to his overpowering tendency to theorise
and generalise." This tendency, in the case of Charles Darwin, was fully
kept in check by the determination to test his theories to the utmost.
Erasmus had a strong love of all kinds of mechanism, for which Charles
Darwin had no taste. Neither had Charles Darwin the literary temperament
which made Erasmus a poet as well as a philosopher. He writes of Erasmus
('Life of Erasmus Darwin,' page 68.): "Throughout his letters I have
been struck with his indifference to fame, and the complete absence of
all signs of any over-estimation of his own abilities, or of the success
of his works." These, indeed, seem indications of traits most strikingly
prominent in his own character. Yet we get no evidence in Erasmus of
the intense modesty and simplicity that marked Charles Darwin's whole
nature. But by the quick bursts of anger provoked in Erasmus, at the
sight of any inhumanity or injustice, we are again reminded of him.

On the whole, however, it seems to me that we do not know enough of the
essential personal tone of Erasmus Darwin's character to attempt more
than a superficial comparison; and I am left with an impression that, in
spite of many resemblances, the two men were of a different type. It
has been shown that Miss Seward and Mrs. Schimmelpenninck have
misrepresented Erasmus Darwin's character. (Ibid., pages 77, 79, etc.)
It is, however, extremely probable that the faults which they exaggerate
were to some extent characteristic of the man; and this leads me to
think that Erasmus had a certain acerbity or severity of temper which
did not exist in his grandson.

The sons of Erasmus Darwin inherited in some degree his intellectual
tastes, for Charles Darwin writes of them as follows:

"His eldest son, Charles (born September 3, 1758), was a young man of
extraordinary promise, but died (May 15, 1778) before he was twenty-one
years old, from the effects of a wound received whilst dissecting
the brain of a child. He inherited from his father a strong taste for
various branches of science, for writing verses, and for mechanics...He
also inherited stammering. With the hope of curing him, his father sent
him to France, when about eight years old (1766-'67), with a private
tutor, thinking that if he was not allowed to speak English for a time,
the habit of stammering might be lost; and it is a curious fact, that in
after years, when speaking French, he never stammered. At a very early
age he collected specimens of all kinds. When sixteen years old he
was sent for a year to [Christ Church] Oxford, but he did not like the
place, and thought (in the words of his father) that the 'vigour of his
mind languished in the pursuit of classical elegance like Hercules at
the distaff, and sighed to be removed to the robuster exercise of
the medical school of Edinburgh.' He stayed three years at Edinburgh,
working hard at his medical studies, and attending 'with diligence all
the sick poor of the parish of Waterleith, and supplying them with the
necessary medicines.' The Aesculapian Society awarded him its first
gold medal for an experimental inquiry on pus and mucus. Notices of
him appeared in various journals; and all the writers agree about his
uncommon energy and abilities. He seems like his father to have
excited the warm affection of his friends. Professor Andrew Duncan...
spoke...about him with the warmest affection forty-seven years after his
death when I was a young medical student at Edinburgh...

"About the character of his second son, Erasmus (born 1759), I have
little to say, for though he wrote poetry, he seems to have had none
of the other tastes of his father. He had, however, his own peculiar
tastes, viz., genealogy, the collecting of coins, and statistics. When
a boy he counted all the houses in the city of Lichfield, and found out
the number of inhabitants in as many as he could; he thus made a census,
and when a real one was first made, his estimate was found to be nearly
accurate. His disposition was quiet and retiring. My father had a very
high opinion of his abilities, and this was probably just, for he would
not otherwise have been invited to travel with, and pay long visits to,
men so distinguished in different ways as Boulton the engineer, and Day
the moralist and novelist." His death by suicide, in 1799, seems to have
taken place in a state of incipient insanity.

Robert Waring, the father of Charles Darwin, was born May 30, 1766, and
entered the medical profession like his father. He studied for a few
months at Leyden, and took his M.D. (I owe this information to the
kindness of Professor Rauwenhoff, Director of the Archives at Leyden.
He quotes from the catalogue of doctors that "Robertus Waring Darwin,
Anglo-britannus," defended (February 26, 1785) in the Senate a
Dissertation on the coloured images seen after looking at a bright
object, and "Medicinae Doctor creatus est a clar. Paradijs." The
archives of Leyden University are so complete that Professor Rauwenhoff
is able to tell me that my grandfather lived together with a certain
"Petrus Crompton, Anglus," in lodgings in the Apothekersdijk. Dr.
Darwin's Leyden dissertation was published in the 'Philosophical
Transactions,' and my father used to say that the work was in fact due
to Erasmus Darwin.--F.D.) at that University on February 26, 1785. "His
father" (Erasmus) "brought ('Life of Erasmus Darwin,' page 85.) him to
Shrewsbury before he was twenty-one years old (1787), and left him 20
pounds, saying, 'Let me know when you want more, and I will send it
you.' His uncle, the rector of Elston, afterwards also sent him
20 pounds, and this was the sole pecuniary aid which he ever
received...Erasmus tells Mr. Edgeworth that his son Robert, after being
settled in Shrewsbury for only six months, 'already had between forty
and fifty patients.' By the second year he was in considerable, and ever
afterwards in very large, practice."

Robert Waring Darwin married (April 18, 1796) Susannah, the daughter
of his father's friend, Josiah Wedgwood, of Etruria, then in her
thirty-second year. We have a miniature of her, with a remarkably sweet
and happy face, bearing some resemblance to the portrait by Sir Joshua
Reynolds of her father; a countenance expressive of the gentle and
sympathetic nature which Miss Meteyard ascribes to her. ('A Group of
Englishmen,' by Miss Meteyard, 1871.) She died July 15, 1817, thirty-two
years before her husband, whose death occurred on November 13, 1848. Dr.
Darwin lived before his marriage for two or three years on St. John's
Hill; afterwards at the Crescent, where his eldest daughter Marianne
was born; lastly at the "Mount," in the part of Shrewsbury known as
Frankwell, where the other children were born. This house was built
by Dr. Darwin about 1800, it is now in the possession of Mr. Spencer
Phillips, and has undergone but little alteration. It is a large, plain,
square, red-brick house, of which the most attractive feature is the
pretty green-house, opening out of the morning-room.

The house is charmingly placed, on the top of a steep bank leading down
to the Severn. The terraced bank is traversed by a long walk, leading
from end to end, still called "the Doctor's Walk." At one point in this
walk grows a Spanish chestnut, the branches of which bend back parallel
to themselves in a curious manner, and this was Charles Darwin's
favourite tree as a boy, where he and his sister Catherine had each
their special seat.

The Doctor took a great pleasure in his garden, planting it with
ornamental trees and shrubs, and being especially successful in
fruit-trees; and this love of plants was, I think, the only taste
kindred to natural history which he possessed. Of the "Mount
pigeons," which Miss Meteyard describes as illustrating Dr. Darwin's
natural-history taste, I have not been able to hear from those most
capable of knowing. Miss Meteyard's account of him is not quite accurate
in a few points. For instance, it is incorrect to describe Dr. Darwin as
having a philosophical mind; his was a mind especially given to detail,
and not to generalising. Again, those who knew him intimately describe
him as eating remarkably little, so that he was not "a great feeder,
eating a goose for his dinner, as easily as other men do a partridge."
('A Group of Englishmen,' page 263.) In the matter of dress he was
conservative, and wore to the end of his life knee-breeches and drab
gaiters, which, however, certainly did not, as Miss Meteyard says,
button above the knee--a form of costume chiefly known to us in
grenadiers of Queen Anne's day, and in modern wood-cutters and
ploughboys.

Charles Darwin had the strongest feeling of love and respect for his
father's memory. His recollection of everything that was connected with
him was peculiarly distinct, and he spoke of him frequently; generally
prefacing an anecdote with some such phrase as, "My father, who was
the wisest man I ever knew, etc..." It was astonishing how clearly he
remembered his father's opinions, so that he was able to quote some
maxims or hint of his in most cases of illness. As a rule, he put small
faith in doctors, and thus his unlimited belief in Dr. Darwin's medical
instinct and methods of treatment was all the more striking.

His reverence for him was boundless and most touching. He would have
wished to judge everything else in the world dispassionately, but
anything his father had said was received with almost implicit faith.
His daughter Mrs. Litchfield remembers him saying that he hoped none
of his sons would ever believe anything because he said it, unless they
were themselves convinced of its truth,--a feeling in striking contrast
with his own manner of faith.

A visit which Charles Darwin made to Shrewsbury in 1869 left on the mind
of his daughter who accompanied him a strong impression of his love for
his old home. The then tenant of the Mount showed them over the house,
etc., and with mistaken hospitality remained with the party during the
whole visit. As they were leaving, Charles Darwin said, with a pathetic
look of regret, "If I could have been left alone in that green-house
for five minutes, I know I should have been able to see my father in his
wheel-chair as vividly as if he had been there before me."

Perhaps this incident shows what I think is the truth, that the memory
of his father he loved the best, was that of him as an old man. Mrs.
Litchfield has noted down a few words which illustrate well his feeling
towards his father. She describes him as saying with the most tender
respect, "I think my father was a little unjust to me when I was young,
but afterwards I am thankful to think I became a prime favourite with
him." She has a vivid recollection of the expression of happy reverie
that accompanied these words, as if he were reviewing the whole
relation, and the remembrance left a deep sense of peace and gratitude.

What follows was added by Charles Darwin to his autobiographical
'Recollections,' and was written about 1877 or 1878.

"I may here add a few pages about my father, who was in many ways a
remarkable man.

"He was about 6 feet 2 inches in height, with broad shoulders, and very
corpulent, so that he was the largest man whom I ever saw. When he
last weighed himself, he was 24 stone, but afterwards increased much in
weight. His chief mental characteristics were his powers of observation
and his sympathy, neither of which have I ever seen exceeded or even
equalled. His sympathy was not only with the distresses of others, but
in a greater degree with the pleasures of all around him. This led him
to be always scheming to give pleasure to others, and, though hating
extravagance, to perform many generous actions. For instance, Mr. B--,
a small manufacturer in Shrewsbury, came to him one day, and said he
should be bankrupt unless he could at once borrow 10,000 pounds, but
that he was unable to give any legal security. My father heard his
reasons for believing that he could ultimately repay the money, and
from [his] intuitive perception of character felt sure that he was to
be trusted. So he advanced this sum, which was a very large one for him
while young, and was after a time repaid.

"I suppose that it was his sympathy which gave him unbounded power of
winning confidence, and as a consequence made him highly successful as a
physician. He began to practise before he was twenty-one years old, and
his fees during the first year paid for the keep of two horses and a
servant. On the following year his practice was large, and so continued
for about sixty years, when he ceased to attend on any one. His great
success as a doctor was the more remarkable, as he told me that he
at first hated his profession so much that if he had been sure of the
smallest pittance, or if his father had given him any choice, nothing
should have induced him to follow it. To the end of his life, the
thought of an operation almost sickened him, and he could scarcely
endure to see a person bled--a horror which he has transmitted to
me--and I remember the horror which I felt as a schoolboy in reading
about Pliny (I think) bleeding to death in a warm bath...

"Owing to my father's power of winning confidence, many patients,
especially ladies, consulted him when suffering from any misery, as
a sort of Father-Confessor. He told me that they always began by
complaining in a vague manner about their health, and by practice he
soon guessed what was really the matter. He then suggested that they
had been suffering in their minds, and now they would pour out their
troubles, and he heard nothing more about the body...Owing to
my father's skill in winning confidence he received many strange
confessions of misery and guilt. He often remarked how many miserable
wives he had known. In several instances husbands and wives had gone on
pretty well together for between twenty and thirty years, and then hated
each other bitterly; this he attributed to their having lost a common
bond in their young children having grown up.

"But the most remarkable power which my father possessed was that of
reading the characters, and even the thoughts of those whom he saw even
for a short time. We had many instances of the power, some of which
seemed almost supernatural. It saved my father from ever making (with
one exception, and the character of this man was soon discovered) an
unworthy friend. A strange clergyman came to Shrewsbury, and seemed
to be a rich man; everybody called on him, and he was invited to many
houses. My father called, and on his return home told my sisters on no
account to invite him or his family to our house; for he felt sure that
the man was not to be trusted. After a few months he suddenly bolted,
being heavily in debt, and was found out to be little better than an
habitual swindler. Here is a case of trustfulness which not many men
would have ventured on. An Irish gentleman, a complete stranger, called
on my father one day, and said that he had lost his purse, and that it
would be a serious inconvenience to him to wait in Shrewsbury until he
could receive a remittance from Ireland. He then asked my father to lend
him 20 pounds, which was immediately done, as my father felt certain
that the story was a true one. As soon as a letter could arrive from
Ireland, one came with the most profuse thanks, and enclosing, as he
said, a 20 pound Bank of England note, but no note was enclosed. I asked
my father whether this did not stagger him, but he answered 'not in
the least.' On the next day another letter came with many apologies for
having forgotten (like a true Irishman) to put the note into his letter
of the day before...(A gentleman) brought his nephew, who was insane
but quite gentle, to my father; and the young man's insanity led him to
accuse himself of all the crimes under heaven. When my father afterwards
talked over the matter with the uncle, he said, 'I am sure that your
nephew is really guilty of...a heinous crime.' Whereupon [the gentleman]
said, 'Good God, Dr. Darwin, who told you; we thought that no human
being knew the fact except ourselves!' My father told me the story many
years after the event, and I asked him how he distinguished the true
from the false self-accusations; and it was very characteristic of my
father that he said he could not explain how it was.

"The following story shows what good guesses my father could make. Lord
Shelburne, afterwards the first Marquis of Lansdowne, was famous (as
Macaulay somewhere remarks) for his knowledge of the affairs of Europe,
on which he greatly prided himself. He consulted my father medically,
and afterwards harangued him on the state of Holland. My father had
studied medicine at Leyden, and one day [while there] went a long walk
into the country with a friend who took him to the house of a clergyman
(we will say the Rev. Mr. A--, for I have forgotten his name), who had
married an Englishwoman. My father was very hungry, and there was little
for luncheon except cheese, which he could never eat. The old lady was
surprised and grieved at this, and assured my father that it was an
excellent cheese, and had been sent her from Bowood, the seat of Lord
Shelburne. My father wondered why a cheese should be sent her from
Bowood, but thought nothing more about it until it flashed across his
mind many years afterwards, whilst Lord Shelburne was talking about
Holland. So he answered, 'I should think from what I saw of the Rev. Mr.
A--, that he was a very able man, and well acquainted with the state
of Holland.' My father saw that the Earl, who immediately changed the
conversation was much startled. On the next morning my father received a
note from the Earl, saying that he had delayed starting on his journey,
and wished particularly to see my father. When he called, the Earl said,
'Dr. Darwin, it is of the utmost importance to me and to the Rev.
Mr. A-- to learn how you have discovered that he is the source of my
information about Holland.' So my father had to explain the state of
the case, and he supposed that Lord Shelburne was much struck with
his diplomatic skill in guessing, for during many years afterwards he
received many kind messages from him through various friends. I think
that he must have told the story to his children; for Sir C. Lyell asked
me many years ago why the Marquis of Lansdowne (the son or grand-son
of the first marquis) felt so much interest about me, whom he had never
seen, and my family. When forty new members (the forty thieves as they
were then called) were added to the Athenaeum Club, there was much
canvassing to be one of them; and without my having asked any one,
Lord Lansdowne proposed me and got me elected. If I am right in my
supposition, it was a queer concatenation of events that my father not
eating cheese half-a-century before in Holland led to my election as a
member of the Athenaeum.

"The sharpness of his observation led him to predict with remarkable
skill the course of any illness, and he suggested endless small details
of relief. I was told that a young doctor in Shrewsbury, who disliked my
father, used to say that he was wholly unscientific, but owned that his
power of predicting the end of an illness was unparalleled. Formerly
when he thought that I should be a doctor, he talked much to me about
his patients. In the old days the practice of bleeding largely was
universal, but my father maintained that far more evil was thus caused
than good done; and he advised me if ever I was myself ill not to allow
any doctor to take more than an extremely small quantity of blood. Long
before typhoid fever was recognised as distinct, my father told me that
two utterly distinct kinds of illness were confounded under the name
of typhus fever. He was vehement against drinking, and was convinced of
both the direct and inherited evil effects of alcohol when habitually
taken even in moderate quantity in a very large majority of cases. But
he admitted and advanced instances of certain persons who could drink
largely during their whole lives without apparently suffering any evil
effects, and he believed that he could often beforehand tell who would
thus not suffer. He himself never drank a drop of any alcoholic fluid.
This remark reminds me of a case showing how a witness under the most
favourable circumstances may be utterly mistaken. A gentleman-farmer was
strongly urged by my father not to drink, and was encouraged by being
told that he himself never touched any spirituous liquor. Whereupon the
gentleman said, 'Come, come, Doctor, this won't do--though it is very
kind of you to say so for my sake--for I know that you take a very
large glass of hot gin and water every evening after your dinner.' (This
belief still survives, and was mentioned to my brother in 1884 by an
old inhabitant of Shrewsbury.--F.D.) So my father asked him how he knew
this. The man answered, 'My cook was your kitchen-maid for two or three
years, and she saw the butler every day prepare and take to you the
gin and water.' The explanation was that my father had the odd habit of
drinking hot water in a very tall and large glass after his dinner; and
the butler used first to put some cold water in the glass, which the
girl mistook for gin, and then filled it up with boiling water from the
kitchen boiler.

"My father used to tell me many little things which he had found useful
in his medical practice. Thus ladies often cried much while telling him
their troubles, and thus caused much loss of his precious time. He soon
found that begging them to command and restrain themselves, always made
them weep the more, so that afterwards he always encouraged them to go
on crying, saying that this would relieve them more than anything else,
and with the invariable result that they soon ceased to cry, and he
could hear what they had to say and give his advice. When patients who
were very ill craved for some strange and unnatural food, my father
asked them what had put such an idea into their heads; if they answered
that they did not know, he would allow them to try the food, and often
with success, as he trusted to their having a kind of instinctive
desire; but if they answered that they had heard that the food in
question had done good to some one else, he firmly refused his assent.

"He gave one day an odd little specimen of human nature. When a very
young man he was called in to consult with the family physician in the
case of a gentleman of much distinction in Shropshire. The old doctor
told the wife that the illness was of such a nature that it must
end fatally. My father took a different view and maintained that the
gentleman would recover: he was proved quite wrong in all respects (I
think by autopsy) and he owned his error. He was then convinced that he
should never again be consulted by this family; but after a few months
the widow sent for him, having dismissed the old family doctor. My
father was so much surprised at this, that he asked a friend of the
widow to find out why he was again consulted. The widow answered her
friend, that 'she would never again see the odious old doctor who said
from the first that her husband would die, while Dr. Darwin always
maintained that he would recover!' In another case my father told a lady
that her husband would certainly die. Some months afterwards he saw
the widow, who was a very sensible woman, and she said, 'You are a very
young man, and allow me to advise you always to give, as long as you
possibly can, hope to any near relative nursing a patient. You made me
despair, and from that moment I lost strength.' My father said that
he had often since seen the paramount importance, for the sake of the
patient, of keeping up the hope and with it the strength of the nurse in
charge. This he sometimes found difficult to do compatibly with truth.
One old gentleman, however, caused him no such perplexity. He was sent
for by Mr.P--, who said, 'From all that I have seen and heard of you I
believe that you are the sort of man who will speak the truth, and if I
ask, you will tell me when I am dying. Now I much desire that you should
attend me, if you will promise, whatever I may say, always to declare
that I am not going to die.' My father acquiesced on the understanding
that his words should in fact have no meaning.

"My father possessed an extraordinary memory, especially for dates, so
that he knew, when he was very old, the day of the birth, marriage, and
death of a multitude of persons in Shropshire; and he once told me that
this power annoyed him; for if he once heard a date, he could not forget
it; and thus the deaths of many friends were often recalled to his mind.
Owing to his strong memory he knew an extraordinary number of curious
stories, which he liked to tell, as he was a great talker. He was
generally in high spirits, and laughed and joked with every one--often
with his servants--with the utmost freedom; yet he had the art of making
every one obey him to the letter. Many persons were much afraid of him.
I remember my father telling us one day, with a laugh, that several
persons had asked him whether Miss --, a grand old lady in Shropshire,
had called on him, so that at last he enquired why they asked him; and
he was told that Miss --, whom my father had somehow mortally offended,
was telling everybody that she would call and tell 'that fat old doctor
very plainly what she thought of him.' She had already called, but
her courage had failed, and no one could have been more courteous and
friendly. As a boy, I went to stay at the house of --, whose wife was
insane; and the poor creature, as soon as she saw me, was in the most
abject state of terror that I ever saw, weeping bitterly and asking me
over and over again, 'Is your father coming?' but was soon pacified.
On my return home, I asked my father why she was so frightened, and
he answered he was very glad to hear it, as he had frightened her on
purpose, feeling sure that she would be kept in safety and much happier
without any restraint, if her husband could influence her, whenever she
became at all violent, by proposing to send for Dr. Darwin; and these
words succeeded perfectly during the rest of her long life.

"My father was very sensitive, so that many small events annoyed him or
pained him much. I once asked him, when he was old and could not walk,
why he did not drive out for exercise; and he answered, 'Every road out
of Shrewsbury is associated in my mind with some painful event.' Yet he
was generally in high spirits. He was easily made very angry, but his
kindness was unbounded. He was widely and deeply loved.

"He was a cautious and good man of business, so that he hardly ever lost
money by an investment, and left to his children a very large property.
I remember a story showing how easily utterly false beliefs originate
and spread. Mr. E --, a squire of one of the oldest families in
Shropshire, and head partner in a bank, committed suicide. My father was
sent for as a matter of form, and found him dead. I may mention, by the
way, to show how matters were managed in those old days, that because
Mr. E -- was a rather great man, and universally respected, no inquest
was held over his body. My father, in returning home, thought it proper
to call at the bank (where he had an account) to tell the managing
partners of the event, as it was not improbable that it would cause a
run on the bank. Well, the story was spread far and wide, that my father
went into the bank, drew out all his money, left the bank, came back
again, and said, 'I may just tell you that Mr. E -- has killed himself,'
and then departed. It seems that it was then a common belief that money
withdrawn from a bank was not safe until the person had passed out
through the door of the bank. My father did not hear this story till
some little time afterwards, when the managing partner said that he had
departed from his invariable rule of never allowing any one to see the
account of another man, by having shown the ledger with my father's
account to several persons, as this proved that my father had not drawn
out a penny on that day. It would have been dishonourable in my father
to have used his professional knowledge for his private advantage.
Nevertheless, the supposed act was greatly admired by some persons;
and many years afterwards, a gentleman remarked, 'Ah, Doctor, what a
splendid man of business you were in so cleverly getting all your money
safe out of that bank!'

"My father's mind was not scientific, and he did not try to generalize
his knowledge under general laws; yet he formed a theory for almost
everything which occurred. I do not think I gained much from him
intellectually; but his example ought to have been of much moral service
to all his children. One of his golden rules (a hard one to follow) was,
'Never become the friend of any one whom you cannot respect.'"

Dr. Darwin had six children (Of these Mrs. Wedgwood is now the sole
survivor.): Marianne, married Dr. Henry Parker; Caroline, married
Josiah Wedgwood; Erasmus Alvey; Susan, died unmarried; Charles Robert;
Catherine, married Rev. Charles Langton.

The elder son, Erasmus, was born in 1804, and died unmarried at the age
of seventy-seven.

He, like his brother, was educated at Shrewsbury School and at Christ's
College, Cambridge. He studied medicine at Edinburgh and in London, and
took the degree of Bachelor of Medicine at Cambridge. He never made any
pretence of practising as a doctor, and, after leaving Cambridge, lived
a quiet life in London.

There was something pathetic in Charles Darwin's affection for his
brother Erasmus, as if he always recollected his solitary life, and the
touching patience and sweetness of his nature. He often spoke of him
as "Poor old Ras," or "Poor dear old Philos"--I imagine Philos
(Philosopher) was a relic of the days when they worked at chemistry
in the tool-house at Shrewsbury--a time of which he always preserved a
pleasant memory. Erasmus being rather more than four years older than
Charles Darwin, they were not long together at Cambridge, but previously
at Edinburgh they lived in the same lodgings, and after the Voyage they
lived for a time together in Erasmus' house in Great Marlborough Street.
At this time also he often speaks with much affection of Erasmus in his
letters to Fox, using words such as "my dear good old brother." In later
years Erasmus Darwin came to Down occasionally, or joined his brother's
family in a summer holiday. But gradually it came about that he could
not, through ill health, make up his mind to leave London, and then they
only saw each other when Charles Darwin went for a week at a time to his
brother's house in Queen Anne Street.

The following note on his brother's character was written by Charles
Darwin at about the same time that the sketch of his father was added to
the 'Recollections.':--

"My brother Erasmus possessed a remarkably clear mind with extensive
and diversified tastes and knowledge in literature, art, and even in
science. For a short time he collected and dried plants, and during
a somewhat longer time experimented in chemistry. He was extremely
agreeable, and his wit often reminded me of that in the letters and
works of Charles Lamb. He was very kind-hearted...His health from his
boyhood had been weak, and as a consequence he failed in energy. His
spirits were not high, sometimes low, more especially during early
and middle manhood. He read much, even whilst a boy, and at school
encouraged me to read, lending me books. Our minds and tastes
were, however, so different, that I do not think I owe much to him
intellectually. I am inclined to agree with Francis Galton in believing
that education and environment produce only a small effect on the mind
of any one, and that most of our qualities are innate."

Erasmus Darwin's name, though not known to the general public, may
be remembered from the sketch of his character in Carlyle's
'Reminiscences,' which I here reproduce in part:--

"Erasmus Darwin, a most diverse kind of mortal, came to seek us out very
soon ('had heard of Carlyle in Germany, etc.') and continues ever
since to be a quiet house-friend, honestly attached; though his visits
latterly have been rarer and rarer, health so poor, I so occupied, etc.,
etc. He had something of original and sarcastically ingenious in him,
one of the sincerest, naturally truest, and most modest of men; elder
brother of Charles Darwin (the famed Darwin on Species of these days) to
whom I rather prefer him for intellect, had not his health quite doomed
him to silence and patient idleness...My dear one had a great favour for
this honest Darwin always; many a road, to shops and the like, he drove
her in his cab (Darwingium Cabbum comparable to Georgium Sidus) in those
early days when even the charge of omnibuses was a consideration, and
his sparse utterances, sardonic often, were a great amusement to her. 'A
perfect gentleman,' she at once discerned him to be, and of sound worth
and kindliness in the most unaffected form." (Carlyle's 'Reminiscences,'
vol. ii. page 208.)

Charles Darwin did not appreciate this sketch of his brother; he thought
Carlyle had missed the essence of his most lovable nature.

I am tempted by the wish of illustrating further the character of one
so sincerely beloved by all Charles Darwin's children, to reproduce a
letter to the "Spectator" (September 3, 1881) by his cousin Miss Julia
Wedgwood.

"A portrait from Mr. Carlyle's portfolio not regretted by any who loved
the original, surely confers sufficient distinction to warrant a few
words of notice, when the character it depicts is withdrawn from mortal
gaze. Erasmus, the only brother of Charles Darwin, and the faithful
and affectionate old friend of both the Carlyles, has left a circle of
mourners who need no tribute from illustrious pen to embalm the memory
so dear to their hearts; but a wider circle must have felt some interest
excited by that tribute, and may receive with a certain attention the
record of a unique and indelible impression, even though it be made only
on the hearts of those who cannot bequeath it, and with whom, therefore,
it must speedily pass away. They remember it with the same distinctness
as they remember a creation of genius; it has in like manner enriched
and sweetened life, formed a common meeting-point for those who had
no other; and, in its strong fragrance of individuality, enforced that
respect for the idiosyncracies of human character without which moral
judgment is always hard and shallow, and often unjust. Carlyle was one
to find a peculiar enjoyment in the combination of liveliness and repose
which gave his friend's society an influence at once stimulating and
soothing, and the warmth of his appreciation was not made known first
in its posthumous expression; his letters of anxiety nearly thirty
years ago, when the frail life which has been prolonged to old age
was threatened by serious illness, are still fresh in my memory. The
friendship was equally warm with both husband and wife. I remember
well a pathetic little remonstrance from her elicited by an avowal from
Erasmus Darwin, that he preferred cats to dogs, which she felt a slur
on her little 'Nero;' and the tones in which she said, 'Oh, but you
are fond of dogs! you are too kind not to be,' spoke of a long vista of
small, gracious kindnesses, remembered with a tender gratitude. He was
intimate also with a person whose friends, like those of Mr. Carlyle,
have not always had cause to congratulate themselves on their place in
her gallery,--Harriet Martineau. I have heard him more than once call
her a faithful friend, and it always seemed to me a curious tribute
to something in the friendship that he alone supplied; but if she had
written of him at all, I believe the mention, in its heartiness of
appreciation, would have afforded a rare and curious meeting-point with
the other 'Reminiscences,' so like and yet so unlike. It is not possible
to transfer the impression of a character; we can only suggest it by
means of some resemblance; and it is a singular illustration of that
irony which checks or directs our sympathies, that in trying to give
some notion of the man whom, among those who were not his kindred,
Carlyle appears to have most loved, I can say nothing more descriptive
than that he seems to me to have had something in common with the man
whom Carlyle least appreciated. The society of Erasmus Darwin had, to my
mind, much the same charm as the writings of Charles Lamb. There was
the same kind of playfulness, the same lightness of touch, the same
tenderness, perhaps the same limitations. On another side of his nature,
I have often been reminded of him by the quaint, delicate humour, the
superficial intolerance, the deep springs of pity, the peculiar mixture
of something pathetic with a sort of gay scorn, entirely remote from
contempt, which distinguish the Ellesmere of Sir Arthur Helps' earlier
dialogues. Perhaps we recall such natures most distinctly, when such a
resemblance is all that is left of them. The character is not merged
in the creation; and what we lose in the power to communicate our
impression, we seem to gain in its vividness. Erasmus Darwin has
passed away in old age, yet his memory retains something of a youthful
fragrance; his influence gave much happiness, of a kind usually
associated with youth, to many lives besides the illustrious one whose
records justify, though certainly they do not inspire, the wish to place
this fading chaplet on his grave."

The foregoing pages give, in a fragmentary manner, as much perhaps as
need be told of the family from which Charles Darwin came, and may serve
as an introduction to the autobiographical chapter which follows.




CHAPTER 1.II. -- AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

[My father's autobiographical recollections, given in the present
chapter, were written for his children,--and written without any
thought that they would ever be published. To many this may seem an
impossibility; but those who knew my father will understand how it was
not only possible, but natural. The autobiography bears the heading,
'Recollections of the Development of my Mind and Character,' and end
with the following note:--

"Aug.3, 1876. This sketch of my life was begun about May 28th at
Hopedene (Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood's house in Surrey.), and since then I
have written for nearly an hour on most afternoons." It will easily be
understood that, in a narrative of a personal and intimate kind written
for his wife and children, passages should occur which must here be
omitted; and I have not thought it necessary to indicate where
such omissions are made. It has been found necessary to make a few
corrections of obvious verbal slips, but the number of such alterations
has been kept down to the minimum.--F.D.]

A German Editor having written to me for an account of the development
of my mind and character with some sketch of my autobiography, I have
thought that the attempt would amuse me, and might possibly interest
my children or their children. I know that it would have interested me
greatly to have read even so short and dull a sketch of the mind of my
grandfather, written by himself, and what he thought and did, and how he
worked. I have attempted to write the following account of myself, as if
I were a dead man in another world looking back at my own life. Nor have
I found this difficult, for life is nearly over with me. I have taken no
pains about my style of writing.

I was born at Shrewsbury on February 12th, 1809, and my earliest
recollection goes back only to when I was a few months over four years
old, when we went to near Abergele for sea-bathing, and I recollect some
events and places there with some little distinctness.

My mother died in July 1817, when I was a little over eight years old,
and it is odd that I can remember hardly anything about her except
her death-bed, her black velvet gown, and her curiously constructed
work-table. In the spring of this same year I was sent to a day-school
in Shrewsbury, where I stayed a year. I have been told that I was much
slower in learning than my younger sister Catherine, and I believe that
I was in many ways a naughty boy.

By the time I went to this day-school (Kept by Rev. G. Case, minister of
the Unitarian Chapel in the High Street. Mrs. Darwin was a Unitarian
and attended Mr. Case's chapel, and my father as a little boy went there
with his elder sisters. But both he and his brother were christened and
intended to belong to the Church of England; and after his early boyhood
he seems usually to have gone to church and not to Mr. Case's. It
appears ("St. James' Gazette", Dec. 15, 1883) that a mural tablet has
been erected to his memory in the chapel, which is now known as the
'Free Christian Church.') my taste for natural history, and more
especially for collecting, was well developed. I tried to make out
the names of plants (Rev. W.A. Leighton, who was a schoolfellow of my
father's at Mr. Case's school, remembers his bringing a flower to school
and saying that his mother had taught him how by looking at the inside
of the blossom the name of the plant could be discovered. Mr. Leighton
goes on, "This greatly roused my attention and curiosity, and I enquired
of him repeatedly how this could be done?"--but his lesson was naturally
enough not transmissible.--F.D.), and collected all sorts of things,
shells, seals, franks, coins, and minerals. The passion for collecting
which leads a man to be a systematic naturalist, a virtuoso, or a miser,
was very strong in me, and was clearly innate, as none of my sisters or
brother ever had this taste.

One little event during this year has fixed itself very firmly in my
mind, and I hope that it has done so from my conscience having been
afterwards sorely troubled by it; it is curious as showing that
apparently I was interested at this early age in the variability of
plants! I told another little boy (I believe it was Leighton, who
afterwards became a well-known lichenologist and botanist), that I could
produce variously coloured polyanthuses and primroses by watering them
with certain coloured fluids, which was of course a monstrous fable, and
had never been tried by me. I may here also confess that as a little boy
I was much given to inventing deliberate falsehoods, and this was always
done for the sake of causing excitement. For instance, I once gathered
much valuable fruit from my father's trees and hid it in the shrubbery,
and then ran in breathless haste to spread the news that I had
discovered a hoard of stolen fruit.

I must have been a very simple little fellow when I first went to the
school. A boy of the name of Garnett took me into a cake shop one day,
and bought some cakes for which he did not pay, as the shopman trusted
him. When we came out I asked him why he did not pay for them, and he
instantly answered, "Why, do you not know that my uncle left a great
sum of money to the town on condition that every tradesman should give
whatever was wanted without payment to any one who wore his old hat and
moved [it] in a particular manner?" and he then showed me how it was
moved. He then went into another shop where he was trusted, and asked
for some small article, moving his hat in the proper manner, and of
course obtained it without payment. When we came out he said, "Now if
you like to go by yourself into that cake-shop (how well I remember its
exact position) I will lend you my hat, and you can get whatever you
like if you move the hat on your head properly." I gladly accepted the
generous offer, and went in and asked for some cakes, moved the old hat
and was walking out of the shop, when the shopman made a rush at me, so
I dropped the cakes and ran for dear life, and was astonished by being
greeted with shouts of laughter by my false friend Garnett.

I can say in my own favour that I was as a boy humane, but I owed this
entirely to the instruction and example of my sisters. I doubt indeed
whether humanity is a natural or innate quality. I was very fond of
collecting eggs, but I never took more than a single egg out of a bird's
nest, except on one single occasion, when I took all, not for their
value, but from a sort of bravado.

I had a strong taste for angling, and would sit for any number of hours
on the bank of a river or pond watching the float; when at Maer (The
house of his uncle, Josiah Wedgwood.) I was told that I could kill the
worms with salt and water, and from that day I never spitted a living
worm, though at the expense probably of some loss of success.

Once as a very little boy whilst at the day school, or before that time,
I acted cruelly, for I beat a puppy, I believe, simply from enjoying
the sense of power; but the beating could not have been severe, for
the puppy did not howl, of which I feel sure, as the spot was near
the house. This act lay heavily on my conscience, as is shown by my
remembering the exact spot where the crime was committed. It probably
lay all the heavier from my love of dogs being then, and for a long time
afterwards, a passion. Dogs seemed to know this, for I was an adept in
robbing their love from their masters.

I remember clearly only one other incident during this year whilst at
Mr. Case's daily school,--namely, the burial of a dragoon soldier; and
it is surprising how clearly I can still see the horse with the man's
empty boots and carbine suspended to the saddle, and the firing over the
grave. This scene deeply stirred whatever poetic fancy there was in me.

In the summer of 1818 I went to Dr. Butler's great school in Shrewsbury,
and remained there for seven years still Midsummer 1825, when I was
sixteen years old. I boarded at this school, so that I had the great
advantage of living the life of a true schoolboy; but as the distance
was hardly more than a mile to my home, I very often ran there in the
longer intervals between the callings over and before locking up at
night. This, I think, was in many ways advantageous to me by keeping up
home affections and interests. I remember in the early part of my school
life that I often had to run very quickly to be in time, and from being
a fleet runner was generally successful; but when in doubt I prayed
earnestly to God to help me, and I well remember that I attributed my
success to the prayers and not to my quick running, and marvelled how
generally I was aided.

I have heard my father and elder sister say that I had, as a very young
boy, a strong taste for long solitary walks; but what I thought about I
know not. I often became quite absorbed, and once, whilst returning to
school on the summit of the old fortifications round Shrewsbury, which
had been converted into a public foot-path with no parapet on one side,
I walked off and fell to the ground, but the height was only seven or
eight feet. Nevertheless the number of thoughts which passed through my
mind during this very short, but sudden and wholly unexpected fall, was
astonishing, and seem hardly compatible with what physiologists have, I
believe, proved about each thought requiring quite an appreciable amount
of time.

Nothing could have been worse for the development of my mind than
Dr. Butler's school, as it was strictly classical, nothing else being
taught, except a little ancient geography and history. The school as a
means of education to me was simply a blank. During my whole life I have
been singularly incapable of mastering any language. Especial attention
was paid to verse-making, and this I could never do well. I had many
friends, and got together a good collection of old verses, which by
patching together, sometimes aided by other boys, I could work into any
subject. Much attention was paid to learning by heart the lessons of the
previous day; this I could effect with great facility, learning forty or
fifty lines of Virgil or Homer, whilst I was in morning chapel; but
this exercise was utterly useless, for every verse was forgotten
in forty-eight hours. I was not idle, and with the exception of
versification, generally worked conscientiously at my classics, not
using cribs. The sole pleasure I ever received from such studies, was
from some of the odes of Horace, which I admired greatly.

When I left the school I was for my age neither high nor low in it; and
I believe that I was considered by all my masters and by my father as a
very ordinary boy, rather below the common standard in intellect. To my
deep mortification my father once said to me, "You care for nothing but
shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself
and all your family." But my father, who was the kindest man I ever
knew and whose memory I love with all my heart, must have been angry and
somewhat unjust when he used such words.

Looking back as well as I can at my character during my school life, the
only qualities which at this period promised well for the future,
were, that I had strong and diversified tastes, much zeal for whatever
interested me, and a keen pleasure in understanding any complex subject
or thing. I was taught Euclid by a private tutor, and I distinctly
remember the intense satisfaction which the clear geometrical proofs
gave me. I remember, with equal distinctness, the delight which my uncle
gave me (the father of Francis Galton) by explaining the principle
of the vernier of a barometer with respect to diversified tastes,
independently of science, I was fond of reading various books, and
I used to sit for hours reading the historical plays of Shakespeare,
generally in an old window in the thick walls of the school. I read also
other poetry, such as Thomson's 'Seasons,' and the recently published
poems of Byron and Scott. I mention this because later in life I
wholly lost, to my great regret, all pleasure from poetry of any kind,
including Shakespeare. In connection with pleasure from poetry, I may
add that in 1822 a vivid delight in scenery was first awakened in my
mind, during a riding tour on the borders of Wales, and this has lasted
longer than any other aesthetic pleasure.

Early in my school days a boy had a copy of the 'Wonders of the World,'
which I often read, and disputed with other boys about the veracity of
some of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a
wish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled
by the voyage of the "Beagle". In the latter part of my school life
I became passionately fond of shooting; I do not believe that any
one could have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did for
shooting birds. How well I remember killing my first snipe, and my
excitement was so great that I had much difficulty in reloading my gun
from the trembling of my hands. This taste long continued, and I became
a very good shot. When at Cambridge I used to practise throwing up my
gun to my shoulder before a looking-glass to see that I threw it up
straight. Another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a
lighted candle, and then to fire at it with a cap on the nipple, and if
the aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle.
The explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack, and I was told that the
tutor of the college remarked, "What an extraordinary thing it is, Mr.
Darwin seems to spend hours in cracking a horse-whip in his room, for I
often hear the crack when I pass under his windows."

I had many friends amongst the schoolboys, whom I loved dearly, and I
think that my disposition was then very affectionate.

With respect to science, I continued collecting minerals with much
zeal, but quite unscientifically--all that I cared about was a new-NAMED
mineral, and I hardly attempted to classify them. I must have observed
insects with some little care, for when ten years old (1819) I went for
three weeks to Plas Edwards on the sea-coast in Wales, I was very much
interested and surprised at seeing a large black and scarlet Hemipterous
insect, many moths (Zygaena), and a Cicindela which are not found in
Shropshire. I almost made up my mind to begin collecting all the insects
which I could find dead, for on consulting my sister I concluded that it
was not right to kill insects for the sake of making a collection. From
reading White's 'Selborne,' I took much pleasure in watching the
habits of birds, and even made notes on the subject. In my simplicity I
remember wondering why every gentleman did not become an ornithologist.

Towards the close of my school life, my brother worked hard at
chemistry, and made a fair laboratory with proper apparatus in the
tool-house in the garden, and I was allowed to aid him as a servant in
most of his experiments. He made all the gases and many compounds, and
I read with great care several books on chemistry, such as Henry and
Parkes' 'Chemical Catechism.' The subject interested me greatly, and we
often used to go on working till rather late at night. This was the best
part of my education at school, for it showed me practically the meaning
of experimental science. The fact that we worked at chemistry somehow
got known at school, and as it was an unprecedented fact, I was
nicknamed "Gas." I was also once publicly rebuked by the head-master,
Dr. Butler, for thus wasting my time on such useless subjects; and he
called me very unjustly a "poco curante," and as I did not understand
what he meant, it seemed to me a fearful reproach.

As I was doing no good at school, my father wisely took me away at a
rather earlier age than usual, and sent me (Oct. 1825) to Edinburgh
University with my brother, where I stayed for two years or sessions. My
brother was completing his medical studies, though I do not believe he
ever really intended to practise, and I was sent there to commence
them. But soon after this period I became convinced from various small
circumstances that my father would leave me property enough to subsist
on with some comfort, though I never imagined that I should be so rich a
man as I am; but my belief was sufficient to check any strenuous efforts
to learn medicine.

The instruction at Edinburgh was altogether by lectures, and these were
intolerably dull, with the exception of those on chemistry by Hope; but
to my mind there are no advantages and many disadvantages in lectures
compared with reading. Dr. Duncan's lectures on Materia Medica at 8
o'clock on a winter's morning are something fearful to remember. Dr.--
made his lectures on human anatomy as dull as he was himself, and the
subject disgusted me. It has proved one of the greatest evils in my life
that I was not urged to practise dissection, for I should soon have got
over my disgust; and the practice would have been invaluable for all
my future work. This has been an irremediable evil, as well as my
incapacity to draw. I also attended regularly the clinical wards in the
hospital. Some of the cases distressed me a good deal, and I still have
vivid pictures before me of some of them; but I was not so foolish as to
allow this to lessen my attendance. I cannot understand why this part
of my medical course did not interest me in a greater degree; for during
the summer before coming to Edinburgh I began attending some of the poor
people, chiefly children and women in Shrewsbury: I wrote down as full
an account as I could of the case with all the symptoms, and read them
aloud to my father, who suggested further inquiries and advised me what
medicines to give, which I made up myself. At one time I had at least a
dozen patients, and I felt a keen interest in the work. My father, who
was by far the best judge of character whom I ever knew, declared that
I should make a successful physician,--meaning by this one who would
get many patients. He maintained that the chief element of success was
exciting confidence; but what he saw in me which convinced him that I
should create confidence I know not. I also attended on two occasions
the operating theatre in the hospital at Edinburgh, and saw two very
bad operations, one on a child, but I rushed away before they were
completed. Nor did I ever attend again, for hardly any inducement would
have been strong enough to make me do so; this being long before the
blessed days of chloroform. The two cases fairly haunted me for many a
long year.

My brother stayed only one year at the University, so that during the
second year I was left to my own resources; and this was an advantage,
for I became well acquainted with several young men fond of natural
science. One of these was Ainsworth, who afterwards published his
travels in Assyria; he was a Wernerian geologist, and knew a little
about many subjects. Dr. Coldstream was a very different young man,
prim, formal, highly religious, and most kind-hearted; he afterwards
published some good zoological articles. A third young man was Hardie,
who would, I think, have made a good botanist, but died early in
India. Lastly, Dr. Grant, my senior by several years, but how I became
acquainted with him I cannot remember; he published some first-rate
zoological papers, but after coming to London as Professor in University
College, he did nothing more in science, a fact which has always been
inexplicable to me. I knew him well; he was dry and formal in manner,
with much enthusiasm beneath this outer crust. He one day, when we were
walking together, burst forth in high admiration of Lamarck and his
views on evolution. I listened in silent astonishment, and as far as
I can judge without any effect on my mind. I had previously read the
'Zoonomia' of my grandfather, in which similar views are maintained, but
without producing any effect on me. Nevertheless it is probable that the
hearing rather early in life such views maintained and praised may
have favoured my upholding them under a different form in my 'Origin of
Species.' At this time I admired greatly the 'Zoonomia;' but on reading
it a second time after an interval of ten or fifteen years, I was much
disappointed; the proportion of speculation being so large to the facts
given.

Drs. Grant and Coldstream attended much to marine Zoology, and I often
accompanied the former to collect animals in the tidal pools, which I
dissected as well as I could. I also became friends with some of the
Newhaven fishermen, and sometimes accompanied them when they trawled
for oysters, and thus got many specimens. But from not having had any
regular practice in dissection, and from possessing only a wretched
microscope, my attempts were very poor. Nevertheless I made one
interesting little discovery, and read, about the beginning of the year
1826, a short paper on the subject before the Plinian Society. This was
that the so-called ova of Flustra had the power of independent movement
by means of cilia, and were in fact larvae. In another short paper I
showed that the little globular bodies which had been supposed to be
the young state of Fucus loreus were the egg-cases of the wormlike
Pontobdella muricata.

The Plinian Society was encouraged and, I believe, founded by Professor
Jameson: it consisted of students and met in an underground room in
the University for the sake of reading papers on natural science and
discussing them. I used regularly to attend, and the meetings had a
good effect on me in stimulating my zeal and giving me new congenial
acquaintances. One evening a poor young man got up, and after stammering
for a prodigious length of time, blushing crimson, he at last slowly
got out the words, "Mr. President, I have forgotten what I was going to
say." The poor fellow looked quite overwhelmed, and all the members
were so surprised that no one could think of a word to say to cover his
confusion. The papers which were read to our little society were not
printed, so that I had not the satisfaction of seeing my paper in print;
but I believe Dr. Grant noticed my small discovery in his excellent
memoir on Flustra.

I was also a member of the Royal Medical Society, and attended pretty
regularly; but as the subjects were exclusively medical, I did not much
care about them. Much rubbish was talked there, but there were some good
speakers, of whom the best was the present Sir J. Kay-Shuttleworth. Dr.
Grant took me occasionally to the meetings of the Wernerian Society,
where various papers on natural history were read, discussed, and
afterwards published in the 'Transactions.' I heard Audubon deliver
there some interesting discourses on the habits of N. American birds,
sneering somewhat unjustly at Waterton. By the way, a negro lived in
Edinburgh, who had travelled with Waterton, and gained his livelihood
by stuffing birds, which he did excellently: he gave me lessons for
payment, and I used often to sit with him, for he was a very pleasant
and intelligent man.

Mr. Leonard Horner also took me once to a meeting of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh, where I saw Sir Walter Scott in the chair as President,
and he apologised to the meeting as not feeling fitted for such a
position. I looked at him and at the whole scene with some awe and
reverence, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth, and
to my having attended the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the honour
of being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these
Societies, more than any other similar honour. If I had been told at
that time that I should one day have been thus honoured, I declare that
I should have thought it as ridiculous and improbable, as if I had been
told that I should be elected King of England.

During my second year at Edinburgh I attended --'s lectures on Geology
and Zoology, but they were incredibly dull. The sole effect they
produced on me was the determination never as long as I lived to read
a book on Geology, or in any way to study the science. Yet I feel sure
that I was prepared for a philosophical treatment of the subject; for
an old Mr. Cotton in Shropshire, who knew a good deal about rocks,
had pointed out to me two or three years previously a well-known large
erratic boulder in the town of Shrewsbury, called the "bell-stone"; he
told me that there was no rock of the same kind nearer than Cumberland
or Scotland, and he solemnly assured me that the world would come to an
end before any one would be able to explain how this stone came where
it now lay. This produced a deep impression on me, and I meditated over
this wonderful stone. So that I felt the keenest delight when I first
read of the action of icebergs in transporting boulders, and I gloried
in the progress of Geology. Equally striking is the fact that I, though
now only sixty-seven years old, heard the Professor, in a field lecture
at Salisbury Craigs, discoursing on a trapdyke, with amygdaloidal
margins and the strata indurated on each side, with volcanic rocks all
around us, say that it was a fissure filled with sediment from above,
adding with a sneer that there were men who maintained that it had
been injected from beneath in a molten condition. When I think of this
lecture, I do not wonder that I determined never to attend to Geology.

From attending --'s lectures, I became acquainted with the curator
of the museum, Mr. Macgillivray, who afterwards published a large
and excellent book on the birds of Scotland. I had much interesting
natural-history talk with him, and he was very kind to me. He gave me
some rare shells, for I at that time collected marine mollusca, but with
no great zeal.

My summer vacations during these two years were wholly given up to
amusements, though I always had some book in hand, which I read with
interest. During the summer of 1826 I took a long walking tour with
two friends with knapsacks on our backs through North wales. We walked
thirty miles most days, including one day the ascent of Snowdon. I
also went with my sister a riding tour in North Wales, a servant with
saddle-bags carrying our clothes. The autumns were devoted to shooting
chiefly at Mr. Owen's, at Woodhouse, and at my Uncle Jos's (Josiah
Wedgwood, the son of the founder of the Etruria Works.) at Maer. My zeal
was so great that I used to place my shooting-boots open by my bed-side
when I went to bed, so as not to lose half a minute in putting them on
in the morning; and on one occasion I reached a distant part of the Maer
estate, on the 20th of August for black-game shooting, before I could
see: I then toiled on with the game-keeper the whole day through thick
heath and young Scotch firs.

I kept an exact record of every bird which I shot throughout the whole
season. One day when shooting at Woodhouse with Captain Owen, the eldest
son, and Major Hill, his cousin, afterwards Lord Berwick, both of whom I
liked very much, I thought myself shamefully used, for every time after
I had fired and thought that I had killed a bird, one of the two acted
as if loading his gun, and cried out, "You must not count that bird,
for I fired at the same time," and the gamekeeper, perceiving the joke,
backed them up. After some hours they told me the joke, but it was no
joke to me, for I had shot a large number of birds, but did not know how
many, and could not add them to my list, which I used to do by making a
knot in a piece of string tied to a button-hole. This my wicked friends
had perceived.

How I did enjoy shooting! But I think that I must have been
half-consciously ashamed of my zeal, for I tried to persuade myself
that shooting was almost an intellectual employment; it required so much
skill to judge where to find most game and to hunt the dogs well.

One of my autumnal visits to Maer in 1827 was memorable from meeting
there Sir J. Mackintosh, who was the best converser I ever listened
to. I heard afterwards with a glow of pride that he had said, "There
is something in that young man that interests me." This must have been
chiefly due to his perceiving that I listened with much interest to
everything which he said, for I was as ignorant as a pig about his
subjects of history, politics, and moral philosophy. To hear of praise
from an eminent person, though no doubt apt or certain to excite vanity,
is, I think, good for a young man, as it helps to keep him in the right
course.

My visits to Maer during these two or three succeeding years were quite
delightful, independently of the autumnal shooting. Life there was
perfectly free; the country was very pleasant for walking or riding;
and in the evening there was much very agreeable conversation, not
so personal as it generally is in large family parties, together with
music. In the summer the whole family used often to sit on the steps
of the old portico, with the flower-garden in front, and with the steep
wooded bank opposite the house reflected in the lake, with here and
there a fish rising or a water-bird paddling about. Nothing has left a
more vivid picture on my mind than these evenings at Maer. I was
also attached to and greatly revered my Uncle Jos; he was silent and
reserved, so as to be a rather awful man; but he sometimes talked openly
with me. He was the very type of an upright man, with the clearest
judgment. I do not believe that any power on earth could have made him
swerve an inch from what he considered the right course. I used to apply
to him in my mind the well-known ode of Horace, now forgotten by me, in
which the words "nec vultus tyranni, etc.," come in. (Justum et tenacem
propositi virum Non civium ardor prava jubentium Non vultus instantis
tyranni Mente quatit solida.)

CAMBRIDGE 1828-1831.

After having spent two sessions in Edinburgh, my father perceived, or
he heard from my sisters, that I did not like the thought of being a
physician, so he proposed that I should become a clergyman. He was very
properly vehement against my turning into an idle sporting man, which
then seemed my probable destination. I asked for some time to consider,
as from what little I had heard or thought on the subject I had scruples
about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England;
though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman.
Accordingly I read with care 'Pearson on the Creed,' and a few other
books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict
and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself
that our Creed must be fully accepted.

Considering how fiercely I have been attacked by the orthodox, it seems
ludicrous that I once intended to be a clergyman. Nor was this intention
and my father's wish ever formerly given up, but died a natural death
when, on leaving Cambridge, I joined the "Beagle" as naturalist. If the
phrenologists are to be trusted, I was well fitted in one respect to be
a clergyman. A few years ago the secretaries of a German psychological
society asked me earnestly by letter for a photograph of myself; and
some time afterwards I received the proceedings of one of the meetings,
in which it seemed that the shape of my head had been the subject of a
public discussion, and one of the speakers declared that I had the bump
of reverence developed enough for ten priests.

As it was decided that I should be a clergyman, it was necessary that I
should go to one of the English universities and take a degree; but as
I had never opened a classical book since leaving school, I found to
my dismay, that in the two intervening years I had actually forgotten,
incredible as it may appear, almost everything which I had learnt,
even to some few of the Greek letters. I did not therefore proceed to
Cambridge at the usual time in October, but worked with a private tutor
in Shrewsbury, and went to Cambridge after the Christmas vacation, early
in 1828. I soon recovered my school standard of knowledge, and could
translate easy Greek books, such as Homer and the Greek Testament, with
moderate facility.

During the three years which I spent at Cambridge my time was wasted,
as far as the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at
Edinburgh and at school. I attempted mathematics, and even went during
the summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth,
but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my
not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This
impatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted
that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of
the great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem
to have an extra sense. But I do not believe that I should ever have
succeeded beyond a very low grade. With respect to Classics I did
nothing except attend a few compulsory college lectures, and the
attendance was almost nominal. In my second year I had to work for a
month or two to pass the Little-Go, which I did easily. Again, in my
last year I worked with some earnestness for my final degree of B.A.,
and brushed up my Classics, together with a little Algebra and Euclid,
which latter gave me much pleasure, as it did at school. In order to
pass the B.A. examination, it was also necessary to get up Paley's
'Evidences of Christianity,' and his 'Moral Philosophy.' This was done
in a thorough manner, and I am convinced that I could have written out
the whole of the 'Evidences' with perfect correctness, but not of course
in the clear language of Paley. The logic of this book and, as I may
add, of his 'Natural Theology,' gave me as much delight as did Euclid.
The careful study of these works, without attempting to learn any part
by rote, was the only part of the academical course which, as I then
felt and as I still believe, was of the least use to me in the education
of my mind. I did not at that time trouble myself about Paley's
premises; and taking these on trust, I was charmed and convinced by the
long line of argumentation. By answering well the examination questions
in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in
Classics, I gained a good place among the oi polloi or crowd of men who
do not go in for honours. Oddly enough, I cannot remember how high I
stood, and my memory fluctuates between the fifth, tenth, or twelfth,
name on the list. (Tenth in the list of January 1831.)

Public lectures on several branches were given in the University,
attendance being quite voluntary; but I was so sickened with lectures at
Edinburgh that I did not even attend Sedgwick's eloquent and interesting
lectures. Had I done so I should probably have become a geologist
earlier than I did. I attended, however, Henslow's lectures on Botany,
and liked them much for their extreme clearness, and the admirable
illustrations; but I did not study botany. Henslow used to take his
pupils, including several of the older members of the University, field
excursions, on foot or in coaches, to distant places, or in a barge
down the river, and lectured on the rarer plants and animals which were
observed. These excursions were delightful.

Although, as we shall presently see, there were some redeeming features
in my life at Cambridge, my time was sadly wasted there, and worse than
wasted. From my passion for shooting and for hunting, and, when this
failed, for riding across country, I got into a sporting set, including
some dissipated low-minded young men. We used often to dine together in
the evening, though these dinners often included men of a higher stamp,
and we sometimes drank too much, with jolly singing and playing at cards
afterwards. I know that I ought to feel ashamed of days and evenings
thus spent, but as some of my friends were very pleasant, and we were
all in the highest spirits, I cannot help looking back to these times
with much pleasure.

But I am glad to think that I had many other friends of a widely
different nature. I was very intimate with Whitley (Rev. C. Whitley,
Hon. Canon of Durham, formerly Reader in Natural Philosophy in
Durham University.), who was afterwards Senior Wrangler, and we used
continually to take long walks together. He inoculated me with a taste
for pictures and good engravings, of which I bought some. I frequently
went to the Fitzwilliam Gallery, and my taste must have been fairly
good, for I certainly admired the best pictures, which I discussed with
the old curator. I read also with much interest Sir Joshua Reynolds'
book. This taste, though not natural to me, lasted for several years,
and many of the pictures in the National Gallery in London gave me
much pleasure; that of Sebastian del Piombo exciting in me a sense of
sublimity.

I also got into a musical set, I believe by means of my warm-hearted
friend, Herbert (The late John Maurice Herbert, County Court Judge of
Cardiff and the Monmouth Circuit.), who took a high wrangler's degree.
From associating with these men, and hearing them play, I acquired a
strong taste for music, and used very often to time my walks so as to
hear on week days the anthem in King's College Chapel. This gave me
intense pleasure, so that my backbone would sometimes shiver. I am sure
that there was no affectation or mere imitation in this taste, for I
used generally to go by myself to King's College, and I sometimes hired
the chorister boys to sing in my rooms. Nevertheless I am so utterly
destitute of an ear, that I cannot perceive a discord, or keep time
and hum a tune correctly; and it is a mystery how I could possibly have
derived pleasure from music.

My musical friends soon perceived my state, and sometimes amused
themselves by making me pass an examination, which consisted in
ascertaining how many tunes I could recognise when they were played
rather more quickly or slowly than usual. 'God save the King,' when thus
played, was a sore puzzle. There was another man with almost as bad an
ear as I had, and strange to say he played a little on the flute. Once I
had the triumph of beating him in one of our musical examinations.

But no pursuit at Cambridge was followed with nearly so much eagerness
or gave me so much pleasure as collecting beetles. It was the mere
passion for collecting, for I did not dissect them, and rarely compared
their external characters with published descriptions, but got them
named anyhow. I will give a proof of my zeal: one day, on tearing off
some old bark, I saw two rare beetles, and seized one in each hand; then
I saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so that I
popped the one which I held in my right hand into my mouth. Alas! it
ejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was
forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as was the third one.

I was very successful in collecting, and invented two new methods; I
employed a labourer to scrape during the winter, moss off old trees
and place it in a large bag, and likewise to collect the rubbish at the
bottom of the barges in which reeds are brought from the fens, and thus
I got some very rare species. No poet ever felt more delighted at
seeing his first poem published than I did at seeing, in Stephens'
'Illustrations of British Insects,' the magic words, "captured by C.
Darwin, Esq." I was introduced to entomology by my second cousin W.
Darwin Fox, a clever and most pleasant man, who was then at Christ's
College, and with whom I became extremely intimate. Afterwards I became
well acquainted, and went out collecting, with Albert Way of Trinity,
who in after years became a well-known archaeologist; also with H.
Thompson of the same College, afterwards a leading agriculturist,
chairman of a great railway, and Member of Parliament. It seems
therefore that a taste for collecting beetles is some indication of
future success in life!

I am surprised what an indelible impression many of the beetles which
I caught at Cambridge have left on my mind. I can remember the exact
appearance of certain posts, old trees and banks where I made a good
capture. The pretty Panagaeus crux-major was a treasure in those days,
and here at Down I saw a beetle running across a walk, and on picking it
up instantly perceived that it differed slightly from P. crux-major,
and it turned out to be P. quadripunctatus, which is only a variety or
closely allied species, differing from it very slightly in outline. I
had never seen in those old days Licinus alive, which to an uneducated
eye hardly differs from many of the black Carabidous beetles; but my
sons found here a specimen, and I instantly recognised that it was new
to me; yet I had not looked at a British beetle for the last twenty
years.

I have not as yet mentioned a circumstance which influenced my whole
career more than any other. This was my friendship with Professor
Henslow. Before coming up to Cambridge, I had heard of him from my
brother as a man who knew every branch of science, and I was accordingly
prepared to reverence him. He kept open house once every week when
all undergraduates, and some older members of the University, who were
attached to science, used to meet in the evening. I soon got, through
Fox, an invitation, and went there regularly. Before long I became
well acquainted with Henslow, and during the latter half of my time at
Cambridge took long walks with him on most days; so that I was called by
some of the dons "the man who walks with Henslow;" and in the evening I
was very often asked to join his family dinner. His knowledge was great
in botany, entomology, chemistry, mineralogy, and geology. His strongest
taste was to draw conclusions from long-continued minute observations.
His judgment was excellent, and his whole mind well balanced; but I
do not suppose that any one would say that he possessed much original
genius. He was deeply religious, and so orthodox that he told me one day
he should be grieved if a single word of the Thirty-nine Articles were
altered. His moral qualities were in every way admirable. He was free
from every tinge of vanity or other petty feeling; and I never saw a man
who thought so little about himself or his own concerns. His temper was
imperturbably good, with the most winning and courteous manners; yet,
as I have seen, he could be roused by any bad action to the warmest
indignation and prompt action.

I once saw in his company in the streets of Cambridge almost as horrid
a scene as could have been witnessed during the French Revolution. Two
body-snatchers had been arrested, and whilst being taken to prison had
been torn from the constable by a crowd of the roughest men, who dragged
them by their legs along the muddy and stony road. They were covered
from head to foot with mud, and their faces were bleeding either from
having been kicked or from the stones; they looked like corpses, but
the crowd was so dense that I got only a few momentary glimpses of the
wretched creatures. Never in my life have I seen such wrath painted on
a man's face as was shown by Henslow at this horrid scene. He tried
repeatedly to penetrate the mob; but it was simply impossible. He then
rushed away to the mayor, telling me not to follow him, but to get more
policemen. I forget the issue, except that the two men were got into the
prison without being killed.

Henslow's benevolence was unbounded, as he proved by his many excellent
schemes for his poor parishioners, when in after years he held the
living of Hitcham. My intimacy with such a man ought to have been, and I
hope was, an inestimable benefit. I cannot resist mentioning a trifling
incident, which showed his kind consideration. Whilst examining some
pollen-grains on a damp surface, I saw the tubes exserted, and instantly
rushed off to communicate my surprising discovery to him. Now I do not
suppose any other professor of botany could have helped laughing at my
coming in such a hurry to make such a communication. But he agreed how
interesting the phenomenon was, and explained its meaning, but made me
clearly understand how well it was known; so I left him not in the
least mortified, but well pleased at having discovered for myself so
remarkable a fact, but determined not to be in such a hurry again to
communicate my discoveries.

Dr. Whewell was one of the older and distinguished men who sometimes
visited Henslow, and on several occasions I walked home with him at
night. Next to Sir J. Mackintosh he was the best converser on grave
subjects to whom I ever listened. Leonard Jenyns (The well-known Soame
Jenyns was cousin to Mr. Jenyns' father.), who afterwards published some
good essays in Natural History (Mr. Jenyns (now Blomefield) described
the fish for the Zoology of the "Beagle"; and is author of a long series
of papers, chiefly Zoological.), often stayed with Henslow, who was his
brother-in-law. I visited him at his parsonage on the borders of the
Fens [Swaffham Bulbeck], and had many a good walk and talk with him
about Natural History. I became also acquainted with several other men
older than me, who did not care much about science, but were friends of
Henslow. One was a Scotchman, brother of Sir Alexander Ramsay, and tutor
of Jesus College: he was a delightful man, but did not live for many
years. Another was Mr. Dawes, afterwards Dean of Hereford, and famous
for his success in the education of the poor. These men and others of
the same standing, together with Henslow, used sometimes to take distant
excursions into the country, which I was allowed to join, and they were
most agreeable.

Looking back, I infer that there must have been something in me a little
superior to the common run of youths, otherwise the above-mentioned men,
so much older than me and higher in academical position, would never
have allowed me to associate with them. Certainly I was not aware of any
such superiority, and I remember one of my sporting friends, Turner,
who saw me at work with my beetles, saying that I should some day be a
Fellow of the Royal Society, and the notion seemed to me preposterous.

During my last year at Cambridge, I read with care and profound interest
Humboldt's 'Personal Narrative.' This work, and Sir J. Herschel's
'Introduction to the Study of Natural Philosophy,' stirred up in me
a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble
structure of Natural Science. No one or a dozen other books influenced
me nearly so much as these two. I copied out from Humboldt long passages
about Teneriffe, and read them aloud on one of the above-mentioned
excursions, to (I think) Henslow, Ramsay, and Dawes, for on a previous
occasion I had talked about the glories of Teneriffe, and some of the
party declared they would endeavour to go there; but I think that they
were only half in earnest. I was, however, quite in earnest, and got
an introduction to a merchant in London to enquire about ships; but
the scheme was, of course, knocked on the head by the voyage of the
"Beagle".

My summer vacations were given up to collecting beetles, to some
reading, and short tours. In the autumn my whole time was devoted to
shooting, chiefly at Woodhouse and Maer, and sometimes with young Eyton
of Eyton. Upon the whole the three years which I spent at Cambridge were
the most joyful in my happy life; for I was then in excellent health,
and almost always in high spirits.

As I had at first come up to Cambridge at Christmas, I was forced to
keep two terms after passing my final examination, at the commencement
of 1831; and Henslow then persuaded me to begin the study of geology.
Therefore on my return to Shropshire I examined sections, and coloured
a map of parts round Shrewsbury. Professor Sedgwick intended to visit
North Wales in the beginning of August to pursue his famous geological
investigations amongst the older rocks, and Henslow asked him to allow
me to accompany him. (In connection with this tour my father used
to tell a story about Sedgwick: they had started from their inn one
morning, and had walked a mile or two, when Sedgwick suddenly stopped,
and vowed that he would return, being certain "that damned scoundrel"
(the waiter) had not given the chambermaid the sixpence intrusted to
him for the purpose. He was ultimately persuaded to give up the project,
seeing that there was no reason for suspecting the waiter of especial
perfidy.--F.D.) Accordingly he came and slept at my father's house.

A short conversation with him during this evening produced a strong
impression on my mind. Whilst examining an old gravel-pit near
Shrewsbury, a labourer told me that he had found in it a large worn
tropical Volute shell, such as may be seen on the chimney-pieces of
cottages; and as he would not sell the shell, I was convinced that he
had really found it in the pit. I told Sedgwick of the fact, and he at
once said (no doubt truly) that it must have been thrown away by some
one into the pit; but then added, if really embedded there it would be
the greatest misfortune to geology, as it would overthrow all that
we know about the superficial deposits of the Midland Counties. These
gravel-beds belong in fact to the glacial period, and in after years I
found in them broken arctic shells. But I was then utterly astonished at
Sedgwick not being delighted at so wonderful a fact as a tropical shell
being found near the surface in the middle of England. Nothing
before had ever made me thoroughly realise, though I had read various
scientific books, that science consists in grouping facts so that
general laws or conclusions may be drawn from them.

Next morning we started for Llangollen, Conway, Bangor, and Capel Curig.
This tour was of decided use in teaching me a little how to make out the
geology of a country. Sedgwick often sent me on a line parallel to
his, telling me to bring back specimens of the rocks and to mark the
stratification on a map. I have little doubt that he did this for my
good, as I was too ignorant to have aided him. On this tour I had a
striking instance of how easy it is to overlook phenomena, however
conspicuous, before they have been observed by any one. We spent many
hours in Cwm Idwal, examining all the rocks with extreme care, as
Sedgwick was anxious to find fossils in them; but neither of us saw
a trace of the wonderful glacial phenomena all around us; we did not
notice the plainly scored rocks, the perched boulders, the lateral and
terminal moraines. Yet these phenomena are so conspicuous that, as
I declared in a paper published many years afterwards in the
'Philosophical Magazine' ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842.), a house
burnt down by fire did not tell its story more plainly than did this
valley. If it had still been filled by a glacier, the phenomena would
have been less distinct than they now are.

At Capel Curig I left Sedgwick and went in a straight line by compass
and map across the mountains to Barmouth, never following any track
unless it coincided with my course. I thus came on some strange wild
places, and enjoyed much this manner of travelling. I visited Barmouth
to see some Cambridge friends who were reading there, and thence
returned to Shrewsbury and to Maer for shooting; for at that time
I should have thought myself mad to give up the first days of
partridge-shooting for geology or any other science.

"VOYAGE OF THE 'BEAGLE' FROM DECEMBER 27, 1831, TO OCTOBER 2, 1836."

On returning home from my short geological tour in North Wales, I found
a letter from Henslow, informing me that Captain Fitz-Roy was willing to
give up part of his own cabin to any young man who would volunteer to go
with him without pay as naturalist to the Voyage of the "Beagle". I
have given, as I believe, in my MS. Journal an account of all the
circumstances which then occurred; I will here only say that I was
instantly eager to accept the offer, but my father strongly objected,
adding the words, fortunate for me, "If you can find any man of common
sense who advises you to go I will give my consent." So I wrote that
evening and refused the offer. On the next morning I went to Maer to
be ready for September 1st, and, whilst out shooting, my uncle (Josiah
Wedgwood.) sent for me, offering to drive me over to Shrewsbury and talk
with my father, as my uncle thought it would be wise in me to accept the
offer. My father always maintained that he was one of the most sensible
men in the world, and he at once consented in the kindest manner. I had
been rather extravagant at Cambridge, and to console my father, said,
"that I should be deuced clever to spend more than my allowance whilst
on board the 'Beagle';" but he answered with a smile, "But they tell me
you are very clever."

Next day I started for Cambridge to see Henslow, and thence to London
to see Fitz-Roy, and all was soon arranged. Afterwards, on becoming very
intimate with Fitz-Roy, I heard that I had run a very narrow risk of
being rejected, on account of the shape of my nose! He was an ardent
disciple of Lavater, and was convinced that he could judge of a man's
character by the outline of his features; and he doubted whether any one
with my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the
voyage. But I think he was afterwards well satisfied that my nose had
spoken falsely.

Fitz-Roy's character was a singular one, with very many noble features:
he was devoted to his duty, generous to a fault, bold, determined, and
indomitably energetic, and an ardent friend to all under his sway. He
would undertake any sort of trouble to assist those whom he thought
deserved assistance. He was a handsome man, strikingly like a gentleman,
with highly courteous manners, which resembled those of his maternal
uncle, the famous Lord Castlereagh, as I was told by the Minister at
Rio. Nevertheless he must have inherited much in his appearance from
Charles II., for Dr. Wallich gave me a collection of photographs which
he had made, and I was struck with the resemblance of one to Fitz-Roy;
and on looking at the name, I found it Ch. E. Sobieski Stuart, Count
d'Albanie, a descendant of the same monarch.

Fitz-Roy's temper was a most unfortunate one. It was usually worst in
the early morning, and with his eagle eye he could generally detect
something amiss about the ship, and was then unsparing in his blame. He
was very kind to me, but was a man very difficult to live with on the
intimate terms which necessarily followed from our messing by ourselves
in the same cabin. We had several quarrels; for instance, early in the
voyage at Bahia, in Brazil, he defended and praised slavery, which I
abominated, and told me that he had just visited a great slave-owner,
who had called up many of his slaves and asked them whether they were
happy, and whether they wished to be free, and all answered "No." I then
asked him, perhaps with a sneer, whether he thought that the answer of
slaves in the presence of their master was worth anything? This made him
excessively angry, and he said that as I doubted his word we could not
live any longer together. I thought that I should have been compelled to
leave the ship; but as soon as the news spread, which it did quickly,
as the captain sent for the first lieutenant to assuage his anger by
abusing me, I was deeply gratified by receiving an invitation from all
the gun-room officers to mess with them. But after a few hours Fitz-Roy
showed his usual magnanimity by sending an officer to me with an apology
and a request that I would continue to live with him.

His character was in several respects one of the most noble which I have
ever known.

The voyage of the "Beagle" has been by far the most important event in
my life, and has determined my whole career; yet it depended on so
small a circumstance as my uncle offering to drive me thirty miles to
Shrewsbury, which few uncles would have done, and on such a trifle as
the shape of my nose. I have always felt that I owe to the voyage the
first real training or education of my mind; I was led to attend
closely to several branches of natural history, and thus my powers of
observation were improved, though they were always fairly developed.

The investigation of the geology of all the places visited was far more
important, as reasoning here comes into play. On first examining a new
district nothing can appear more hopeless than the chaos of rocks; but
by recording the stratification and nature of the rocks and fossils
at many points, always reasoning and predicting what will be found
elsewhere, light soon begins to dawn on the district, and the structure
of the whole becomes more or less intelligible. I had brought with me
the first volume of Lyell's 'Principles of Geology,' which I studied
attentively; and the book was of the highest service to me in many ways.
The very first place which I examined, namely St. Jago in the Cape de
Verde islands, showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of Lyell's
manner of treating geology, compared with that of any other author,
whose works I had with me or ever afterwards read.

Another of my occupations was collecting animals of all classes, briefly
describing and roughly dissecting many of the marine ones; but from not
being able to draw, and from not having sufficient anatomical knowledge,
a great pile of MS. which I made during the voyage has proved almost
useless. I thus lost much time, with the exception of that spent in
acquiring some knowledge of the Crustaceans, as this was of service when
in after years I undertook a monograph of the Cirripedia.

During some part of the day I wrote my Journal, and took much pains in
describing carefully and vividly all that I had seen; and this was good
practice. My Journal served also, in part, as letters to my home, and
portions were sent to England whenever there was an opportunity.

The above various special studies were, however, of no importance
compared with the habit of energetic industry and of concentrated
attention to whatever I was engaged in, which I then acquired.
Everything about which I thought or read was made to bear directly
on what I had seen or was likely to see; and this habit of mind was
continued during the five years of the voyage. I feel sure that it
was this training which has enabled me to do whatever I have done in
science.

Looking backwards, I can now perceive how my love for science gradually
preponderated over every other taste. During the first two years my old
passion for shooting survived in nearly full force, and I shot myself
all the birds and animals for my collection; but gradually I gave up my
gun more and more, and finally altogether, to my servant, as shooting
interfered with my work, more especially with making out the geological
structure of a country. I discovered, though unconsciously and
insensibly, that the pleasure of observing and reasoning was a much
higher one than that of skill and sport. That my mind became developed
through my pursuits during the voyage is rendered probable by a remark
made by my father, who was the most acute observer whom I ever saw, of a
sceptical disposition, and far from being a believer in phrenology; for
on first seeing me after the voyage, he turned round to my sisters, and
exclaimed, "Why, the shape of his head is quite altered."

To return to the voyage. On September 11th (1831), I paid a flying visit
with Fitz-Roy to the "Beagle" at Plymouth. Thence to Shrewsbury to wish
my father and sisters a long farewell. On October 24th I took up my
residence at Plymouth, and remained there until December 27th, when the
"Beagle" finally left the shores of England for her circumnavigation of
the world. We made two earlier attempts to sail, but were driven back
each time by heavy gales. These two months at Plymouth were the most
miserable which I ever spent, though I exerted myself in various ways.
I was out of spirits at the thought of leaving all my family and friends
for so long a time, and the weather seemed to me inexpressibly gloomy.
I was also troubled with palpitation and pain about the heart, and like
many a young ignorant man, especially one with a smattering of medical
knowledge, was convinced that I had heart disease. I did not consult any
doctor, as I fully expected to hear the verdict that I was not fit for
the voyage, and I was resolved to go at all hazards.

I need not here refer to the events of the voyage--where we went and
what we did--as I have given a sufficiently full account in my published
Journal. The glories of the vegetation of the Tropics rise before my
mind at the present time more vividly than anything else; though
the sense of sublimity, which the great deserts of Patagonia and the
forest-clad mountains of Tierra del Fuego excited in me, has left an
indelible impression on my mind. The sight of a naked savage in his
native land is an event which can never be forgotten. Many of my
excursions on horseback through wild countries, or in the boats, some
of which lasted several weeks, were deeply interesting: their discomfort
and some degree of danger were at that time hardly a drawback, and none
at all afterwards. I also reflect with high satisfaction on some of
my scientific work, such as solving the problem of coral islands, and
making out the geological structure of certain islands, for instance,
St. Helena. Nor must I pass over the discovery of the singular relations
of the animals and plants inhabiting the several islands of the
Galapagos archipelago, and of all of them to the inhabitants of South
America.

As far as I can judge of myself, I worked to the utmost during the
voyage from the mere pleasure of investigation, and from my strong
desire to add a few facts to the great mass of facts in Natural
Science. But I was also ambitious to take a fair place among scientific
men,--whether more ambitious or less so than most of my fellow-workers,
I can form no opinion.

The geology of St. Jago is very striking, yet simple: a stream of lava
formerly flowed over the bed of the sea, formed of triturated recent
shells and corals, which it has baked into a hard white rock. Since then
the whole island has been upheaved. But the line of white rock revealed
to me a new and important fact, namely, that there had been afterwards
subsidence round the craters, which had since been in action, and had
poured forth lava. It then first dawned on me that I might perhaps write
a book on the geology of the various countries visited, and this made me
thrill with delight. That was a memorable hour to me, and how distinctly
I can call to mind the low cliff of lava beneath which I rested, with
the sun glaring hot, a few strange desert plants growing near, and
with living corals in the tidal pools at my feet. Later in the voyage,
Fitz-Roy asked me to read some of my Journal, and declared it would be
worth publishing; so here was a second book in prospect!

Towards the close of our voyage I received a letter whilst at Ascension,
in which my sisters told me that Sedgwick had called on my father, and
said that I should take a place among the leading scientific men. I
could not at the time understand how he could have learnt anything of
my proceedings, but I heard (I believe afterwards) that Henslow had
read some of the letters which I wrote to him before the Philosophical
Society of Cambridge (Read at the meeting held November 16, 1835, and
printed in a pamphlet of 31 pages for distribution among the members
of the Society.), and had printed them for private distribution. My
collection of fossil bones, which had been sent to Henslow, also excited
considerable attention amongst palaeontologists. After reading this
letter, I clambered over the mountains of Ascension with a bounding
step, and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer.
All this shows how ambitious I was; but I think that I can say with
truth that in after years, though I cared in the highest degree for the
approbation of such men as Lyell and Hooker, who were my friends, I
did not care much about the general public. I do not mean to say that a
favourable review or a large sale of my books did not please me greatly,
but the pleasure was a fleeting one, and I am sure that I have never
turned one inch out of my course to gain fame.

FROM MY RETURN TO ENGLAND (OCTOBER 2, 1836) TO MY MARRIAGE (JANUARY 29,
1839.)

These two years and three months were the most active ones which I ever
spent, though I was occasionally unwell, and so lost some time. After
going backwards and forwards several times between Shrewsbury,
Maer, Cambridge, and London, I settled in lodgings at Cambridge (In
Fitzwilliam Street.) on December 13th, where all my collections were
under the care of Henslow. I stayed here three months, and got my
minerals and rocks examined by the aid of Professor Miller.

I began preparing my 'Journal of Travels,' which was not hard work,
as my MS. Journal had been written with care, and my chief labour was
making an abstract of my more interesting scientific results. I sent
also, at the request of Lyell, a short account of my observations on
the elevation of the coast of Chile to the Geological Society. ('Geolog.
Soc. Proc. ii. 1838, pages 446-449.)

On March 7th, 1837, I took lodgings in Great Marlborough Street in
London, and remained there for nearly two years, until I was married.
During these two years I finished my Journal, read several papers before
the Geological Society, began preparing the MS. for my 'Geological
Observations,' and arranged for the publication of the 'Zoology of the
Voyage of the "Beagle".' In July I opened my first note-book for facts
in relation to the Origin of Species, about which I had long reflected,
and never ceased working for the next twenty years.

During these two years I also went a little into society, and acted as
one of the honorary secretaries of the Geological Society. I saw a great
deal of Lyell. One of his chief characteristics was his sympathy with
the work of others, and I was as much astonished as delighted at the
interest which he showed when, on my return to England, I explained to
him my views on coral reefs. This encouraged me greatly, and his advice
and example had much influence on me. During this time I saw also a good
deal of Robert Brown; I used often to call and sit with him during his
breakfast on Sunday mornings, and he poured forth a rich treasure of
curious observations and acute remarks, but they almost always related
to minute points, and he never with me discussed large or general
questions in science.

During these two years I took several short excursions as a relaxation,
and one longer one to the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, an account of
which was published in the 'Philosophical Transactions.' (1839, pages
39-82.) This paper was a great failure, and I am ashamed of it. Having
been deeply impressed with what I had seen of the elevation of the land
of South America, I attributed the parallel lines to the action of
the sea; but I had to give up this view when Agassiz propounded his
glacier-lake theory. Because no other explanation was possible under our
then state of knowledge, I argued in favour of sea-action; and my error
has been a good lesson to me never to trust in science to the principle
of exclusion.

As I was not able to work all day at science, I read a good deal during
these two years on various subjects, including some metaphysical books;
but I was not well fitted for such studies. About this time I took much
delight in Wordsworth's and Coleridge's poetry; and can boast that I
read the 'Excursion' twice through. Formerly Milton's 'Paradise Lost'
had been my chief favourite, and in my excursions during the voyage of
the "Beagle", when I could take only a single volume, I always chose
Milton.

FROM MY MARRIAGE, JANUARY 29, 1839, AND RESIDENCE IN UPPER GOWER STREET,
TO OUR LEAVING LONDON AND SETTLING AT DOWN, SEPTEMBER 14, 1842.

(After speaking of his happy married life, and of his children, he
continues:--)

During the three years and eight months whilst we resided in London, I
did less scientific work, though I worked as hard as I possibly could,
than during any other equal length of time in my life. This was owing
to frequently recurring unwellness, and to one long and serious illness.
The greater part of my time, when I could do anything, was devoted to
my work on 'Coral Reefs,' which I had begun before my marriage, and of
which the last proof-sheet was corrected on May 6th, 1842. This book,
though a small one, cost me twenty months of hard work, as I had to read
every work on the islands of the Pacific and to consult many charts. It
was thought highly of by scientific men, and the theory therein given
is, I think, now well established.

No other work of mine was begun in so deductive a spirit as this, for
the whole theory was thought out on the west coast of South America,
before I had seen a true coral reef. I had therefore only to verify and
extend my views by a careful examination of living reefs. But it should
be observed that I had during the two previous years been incessantly
attending to the effects on the shores of South America of the
intermittent elevation of the land, together with denudation and the
deposition of sediment. This necessarily led me to reflect much on the
effects of subsidence, and it was easy to replace in imagination the
continued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals. To do
this was to form my theory of the formation of barrier-reefs and atolls.

Besides my work on coral-reefs, during my residence in London, I read
before the Geological Society papers on the Erratic Boulders of South
America ('Geolog. Soc. Proc.' iii. 1842.), on Earthquakes ('Geolog.
Trans. v. 1840.), and on the Formation by the Agency of Earth-worms of
Mould. ('Geolog. Soc. Proc. ii. 1838.) I also continued to superintend
the publication of the 'Zoology of the Voyage of the "Beagle".' Nor did
I ever intermit collecting facts bearing on the origin of species; and I
could sometimes do this when I could do nothing else from illness.

In the summer of 1842 I was stronger than I had been for some time, and
took a little tour by myself in North Wales, for the sake of observing
the effects of the old glaciers which formerly filled all the larger
valleys. I published a short account of what I saw in the 'Philosophical
Magazine.' ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842.) This excursion interested
me greatly, and it was the last time I was ever strong enough to climb
mountains or to take long walks such as are necessary for geological
work.

During the early part of our life in London, I was strong enough to go
into general society, and saw a good deal of several scientific men, and
other more or less distinguished men. I will give my impressions with
respect to some of them, though I have little to say worth saying.

I saw more of Lyell than of any other man, both before and after
my marriage. His mind was characterised, as it appeared to me, by
clearness, caution, sound judgment, and a good deal of originality. When
I made any remark to him on Geology, he never rested until he saw the
whole case clearly, and often made me see it more clearly than I had
done before. He would advance all possible objections to my suggestion,
and even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious. A second
characteristic was his hearty sympathy with the work of other scientific
men. (The slight repetition here observable is accounted for by the
notes on Lyell, etc., having been added in April, 1881, a few years
after the rest of the 'Recollections' were written.)

On my return from the voyage of the "Beagle", I explained to him
my views on coral-reefs, which differed from his, and I was greatly
surprised and encouraged by the vivid interest which he showed. His
delight in science was ardent, and he felt the keenest interest in the
future progress of mankind. He was very kind-hearted, and thoroughly
liberal in his religious beliefs, or rather disbeliefs; but he was a
strong theist. His candour was highly remarkable. He exhibited this by
becoming a convert to the Descent theory, though he had gained much
fame by opposing Lamarck's views, and this after he had grown old. He
reminded me that I had many years before said to him, when discussing
the opposition of the old school of geologists to his new views, "What
a good thing it would be if every scientific man was to die when sixty
years old, as afterwards he would be sure to oppose all new doctrines."
But he hoped that now he might be allowed to live.

The science of Geology is enormously indebted to Lyell--more so, as I
believe, than to any other man who ever lived. When [I was] starting on
the voyage of the "Beagle", the sagacious Henslow, who, like all other
geologists, believed at that time in successive cataclysms, advised me
to get and study the first volume of the 'Principles,' which had then
just been published, but on no account to accept the views therein
advocated. How differently would any one now speak of the 'Principles'!
I am proud to remember that the first place, namely, St. Jago, in the
Cape de Verde archipelago, in which I geologised, convinced me of the
infinite superiority of Lyell's views over those advocated in any other
work known to me.

The powerful effects of Lyell's works could formerly be plainly seen in
the different progress of the science in France and England. The present
total oblivion of Elie de Beaumont's wild hypotheses, such as his
'Craters of Elevation' and 'Lines of Elevation' (which latter hypothesis
I heard Sedgwick at the Geological Society lauding to the skies), may be
largely attributed to Lyell.

I saw a good deal of Robert Brown, "facile Princeps Botanicorum," as he
was called by Humboldt. He seemed to me to be chiefly remarkable for
the minuteness of his observations, and their perfect accuracy. His
knowledge was extraordinarily great, and much died with him, owing to
his excessive fear of ever making a mistake. He poured out his knowledge
to me in the most unreserved manner, yet was strangely jealous on some
points. I called on him two or three times before the voyage of the
"Beagle", and on one occasion he asked me to look through a microscope
and describe what I saw. This I did, and believe now that it was the
marvellous currents of protoplasm in some vegetable cell. I then asked
him what I had seen; but he answered me, "That is my little secret."

He was capable of the most generous actions. When old, much out of
health, and quite unfit for any exertion, he daily visited (as Hooker
told me) an old man-servant, who lived at a distance (and whom he
supported), and read aloud to him. This is enough to make up for any
degree of scientific penuriousness or jealousy.

I may here mention a few other eminent men, whom I have occasionally
seen, but I have little to say about them worth saying. I felt a high
reverence for Sir J. Herschel, and was delighted to dine with him at his
charming house at the Cape of Good Hope, and afterwards at his London
house. I saw him, also, on a few other occasions. He never talked much,
but every word which he uttered was worth listening to.

I once met at breakfast at Sir R. Murchison's house the illustrious
Humboldt, who honoured me by expressing a wish to see me. I was a little
disappointed with the great man, but my anticipations probably were too
high. I can remember nothing distinctly about our interview, except that
Humboldt was very cheerful and talked much.

--reminds me of Buckle whom I once met at Hensleigh Wedgwood's. I was
very glad to learn from him his system of collecting facts. He told me
that he bought all the books which he read, and made a full index, to
each, of the facts which he thought might prove serviceable to him, and
that he could always remember in what book he had read anything, for his
memory was wonderful. I asked him how at first he could judge what facts
would be serviceable, and he answered that he did not know, but that a
sort of instinct guided him. From this habit of making indices, he was
enabled to give the astonishing number of references on all sorts of
subjects, which may be found in his 'History of Civilisation.' This book
I thought most interesting, and read it twice, but I doubt whether his
generalisations are worth anything. Buckle was a great talker, and I
listened to him saying hardly a word, nor indeed could I have done so
for he left no gaps. When Mrs. Farrer began to sing, I jumped up and
said that I must listen to her; after I had moved away he turned around
to a friend and said (as was overheard by my brother), "Well, Mr.
Darwin's books are much better than his conversation."

Of other great literary men, I once met Sydney Smith at Dean Milman's
house. There was something inexplicably amusing in every word which he
uttered. Perhaps this was partly due to the expectation of being amused.
He was talking about Lady Cork, who was then extremely old. This was the
lady who, as he said, was once so much affected by one of his charity
sermons, that she BORROWED a guinea from a friend to put in the plate.
He now said "It is generally believed that my dear old friend Lady Cork
has been overlooked," and he said this in such a manner that no one
could for a moment doubt that he meant that his dear old friend had been
overlooked by the devil. How he managed to express this I know not.

I likewise once met Macaulay at Lord Stanhope's (the historian's) house,
and as there was only one other man at dinner, I had a grand opportunity
of hearing him converse, and he was very agreeable. He did not talk at
all too much; nor indeed could such a man talk too much, as long as he
allowed others to turn the stream of his conversation, and this he did
allow.

Lord Stanhope once gave me a curious little proof of the accuracy and
fulness of Macaulay's memory: many historians used often to meet at
Lord Stanhope's house, and in discussing various subjects they would
sometimes differ from Macaulay, and formerly they often referred to some
book to see who was right; but latterly, as Lord Stanhope noticed, no
historian ever took this trouble, and whatever Macaulay said was final.

On another occasion I met at Lord Stanhope's house, one of his parties
of historians and other literary men, and amongst them were Motley and
Grote. After luncheon I walked about Chevening Park for nearly an hour
with Grote, and was much interested by his conversation and pleased by
the simplicity and absence of all pretension in his manners.

Long ago I dined occasionally with the old Earl, the father of the
historian; he was a strange man, but what little I knew of him I
liked much. He was frank, genial, and pleasant. He had strongly marked
features, with a brown complexion, and his clothes, when I saw him,
were all brown. He seemed to believe in everything which was to others
utterly incredible. He said one day to me, "Why don't you give up your
fiddle-faddle of geology and zoology, and turn to the occult sciences!"
The historian, then Lord Mahon, seemed shocked at such a speech to me,
and his charming wife much amused.

The last man whom I will mention is Carlyle, seen by me several times at
my brother's house, and two or three times at my own house. His talk was
very racy and interesting, just like his writings, but he sometimes
went on too long on the same subject. I remember a funny dinner at my
brother's, where, amongst a few others, were Babbage and Lyell, both of
whom liked to talk. Carlyle, however, silenced every one by haranguing
during the whole dinner on the advantages of silence. After dinner
Babbage, in his grimmest manner, thanked Carlyle for his very
interesting lecture on silence.

Carlyle sneered at almost every one: one day in my house he called
Grote's 'History' "a fetid quagmire, with nothing spiritual about it." I
always thought, until his 'Reminiscences' appeared, that his sneers were
partly jokes, but this now seems rather doubtful. His expression was
that of a depressed, almost despondent yet benevolent man; and it is
notorious how heartily he laughed. I believe that his benevolence was
real, though stained by not a little jealousy. No one can doubt about
his extraordinary power of drawing pictures of things and men--far more
vivid, as it appears to me, than any drawn by Macaulay. Whether his
pictures of men were true ones is another question.

He has been all-powerful in impressing some grand moral truths on the
minds of men. On the other hand, his views about slavery were revolting.
In his eyes might was right. His mind seemed to me a very narrow one;
even if all branches of science, which he despised, are excluded. It is
astonishing to me that Kingsley should have spoken of him as a man
well fitted to advance science. He laughed to scorn the idea that a
mathematician, such as Whewell, could judge, as I maintained he could,
of Goethe's views on light. He thought it a most ridiculous thing that
any one should care whether a glacier moved a little quicker or a little
slower, or moved at all. As far as I could judge, I never met a man with
a mind so ill adapted for scientific research.

Whilst living in London, I attended as regularly as I could the
meetings of several scientific societies, and acted as secretary to the
Geological Society. But such attendance, and ordinary society, suited my
health so badly that we resolved to live in the country, which we both
preferred and have never repented of.

RESIDENCE AT DOWN FROM SEPTEMBER 14, 1842, TO THE PRESENT TIME, 1876.

After several fruitless searches in Surrey and elsewhere, we found this
house and purchased it. I was pleased with the diversified appearance
of vegetation proper to a chalk district, and so unlike what I had been
accustomed to in the Midland counties; and still more pleased with the
extreme quietness and rusticity of the place. It is not, however, quite
so retired a place as a writer in a German periodical makes it, who
says that my house can be approached only by a mule-track! Our fixing
ourselves here has answered admirably in one way, which we did not
anticipate, namely, by being very convenient for frequent visits from
our children.

Few persons can have lived a more retired life than we have done.
Besides short visits to the houses of relations, and occasionally to the
seaside or elsewhere, we have gone nowhere. During the first part of
our residence we went a little into society, and received a few friends
here; but my health almost always suffered from the excitement, violent
shivering and vomiting attacks being thus brought on. I have therefore
been compelled for many years to give up all dinner-parties; and this
has been somewhat of a deprivation to me, as such parties always put me
into high spirits. From the same cause I have been able to invite here
very few scientific acquaintances.

My chief enjoyment and sole employment throughout life has been
scientific work; and the excitement from such work makes me for the
time forget, or drives quite away, my daily discomfort. I have therefore
nothing to record during the rest of my life, except the publication
of my several books. Perhaps a few details how they arose may be worth
giving.

MY SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS.

In the early part of 1844, my observations on the volcanic islands
visited during the voyage of the "Beagle" were published. In 1845,
I took much pains in correcting a new edition of my 'Journal of
Researches,' which was originally published in 1839 as part of
Fitz-Roy's work. The success of this, my first literary child, always
tickles my vanity more than that of any of my other books. Even to this
day it sells steadily in England and the United States, and has been
translated for the second time into German, and into French and other
languages. This success of a book of travels, especially of a scientific
one, so many years after its first publication, is surprising. Ten
thousand copies have been sold in England of the second edition. In 1846
my 'Geological Observations on South America' were published. I record
in a little diary, which I have always kept, that my three geological
books ('Coral Reefs' included) consumed four and a half years' steady
work; "and now it is ten years since my return to England. How much time
have I lost by illness?" I have nothing to say about these three books
except that to my surprise new editions have lately been called for.
('Geological Observations,' 2nd Edit.1876. 'Coral Reefs,' 2nd Edit.
1874.)

In October, 1846, I began to work on 'Cirripedia.' When on the coast of
Chile, I found a most curious form, which burrowed into the shells of
Concholepas, and which differed so much from all other Cirripedes that
I had to form a new sub-order for its sole reception. Lately an allied
burrowing genus has been found on the shores of Portugal. To understand
the structure of my new Cirripede I had to examine and dissect many
of the common forms; and this gradually led me on to take up the whole
group. I worked steadily on this subject for the next eight years, and
ultimately published two thick volumes (Published by the Ray Society.),
describing all the known living species, and two thin quartos on the
extinct species. I do not doubt that Sir E. Lytton Bulwer had me in his
mind when he introduced in one of his novels a Professor Long, who had
written two huge volumes on limpets.

Although I was employed during eight years on this work, yet I record in
my diary that about two years out of this time was lost by illness. On
this account I went in 1848 for some months to Malvern for hydropathic
treatment, which did me much good, so that on my return home I was able
to resume work. So much was I out of health that when my dear father
died on November 13th, 1848, I was unable to attend his funeral or to
act as one of his executors.

My work on the Cirripedia possesses, I think, considerable value, as
besides describing several new and remarkable forms, I made out the
homologies of the various parts--I discovered the cementing apparatus,
though I blundered dreadfully about the cement glands--and lastly I
proved the existence in certain genera of minute males complemental to
and parasitic on the hermaphrodites. This latter discovery has at last
been fully confirmed; though at one time a German writer was pleased to
attribute the whole account to my fertile imagination. The Cirripedes
form a highly varying and difficult group of species to class; and my
work was of considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in the 'Origin
of Species' the principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless, I
doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time.

From September 1854 I devoted my whole time to arranging my huge pile
of notes, to observing, and to experimenting in relation to the
transmutation of species. During the voyage of the "Beagle" I had been
deeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil
animals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos;
secondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one
another in proceeding southwards over the Continent; and thirdly, by
the South American character of most of the productions of the Galapagos
archipelago, and more especially by the manner in which they differ
slightly on each island of the group; none of the islands appearing to
be very ancient in a geological sense.

It was evident that such facts as these, as well as many others, could
only be explained on the supposition that species gradually become
modified; and the subject haunted me. But it was equally evident that
neither the action of the surrounding conditions, nor the will of the
organisms (especially in the case of plants) could account for the
innumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully
adapted to their habits of life--for instance, a woodpecker or a
tree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes. I
had always been much struck by such adaptations, and until these could
be explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to prove by
indirect evidence that species have been modified.

After my return to England it appeared to me that by following the
example of Lyell in Geology, and by collecting all facts which bore in
any way on the variation of animals and plants under domestication and
nature, some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole subject. My
first note-book was opened in July 1837. I worked on true Baconian
principles, and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale,
more especially with respect to domesticated productions, by printed
enquiries, by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners, and by
extensive reading. When I see the list of books of all kinds which
I read and abstracted, including whole series of Journals and
Transactions, I am surprised at my industry. I soon perceived that
selection was the keystone of man's success in making useful races of
animals and plants. But how selection could be applied to organisms
living in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery to me.

In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic
enquiry, I happened to read for amusement 'Malthus on Population,'
and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which
everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of
animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances
favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable
ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new
species. Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work; but I
was so anxious to avoid prejudice, that I determined not for some time
to write even the briefest sketch of it. In June 1842 I first allowed
myself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in
pencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into
one of 230 pages, which I had fairly copied out and still possess.

But at that time I overlooked one problem of great importance; and it is
astonishing to me, except on the principle of Columbus and his egg,
how I could have overlooked it and its solution. This problem is the
tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in
character as they become modified. That they have diverged greatly is
obvious from the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed
under genera, genera under families, families under sub-orders and
so forth; and I can remember the very spot in the road, whilst in my
carriage, when to my joy the solution occurred to me; and this was
long after I had come to Down. The solution, as I believe, is that the
modified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become
adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature.

Early in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and
I began at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as
that which was afterwards followed in my 'Origin of Species;' yet it
was only an abstract of the materials which I had collected, and I got
through about half the work on this scale. But my plans were overthrown,
for early in the summer of 1858 Mr. Wallace, who was then in the Malay
archipelago, sent me an essay "On the Tendency of Varieties to depart
indefinitely from the Original Type;" and this essay contained exactly
the same theory as mine. Mr. Wallace expressed the wish that if I
thought well of his essay, I should sent it to Lyell for perusal.

The circumstances under which I consented at the request of Lyell and
Hooker to allow of an abstract from my MS., together with a letter to
Asa Gray, dated September 5, 1857, to be published at the same time with
Wallace's Essay, are given in the 'Journal of the Proceedings of the
Linnean Society,' 1858, page 45. I was at first very unwilling
to consent, as I thought Mr. Wallace might consider my doing so
unjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his
disposition. The extract from my MS. and the letter to Asa Gray had
neither been intended for publication, and were badly written. Mr.
Wallace's essay, on the other hand, was admirably expressed and
quite clear. Nevertheless, our joint productions excited very little
attention, and the only published notice of them which I can remember
was by Professor Haughton of Dublin, whose verdict was that all that
was new in them was false, and what was true was old. This shows how
necessary it is that any new view should be explained at considerable
length in order to arouse public attention.

In September 1858 I set to work by the strong advice of Lyell and Hooker
to prepare a volume on the transmutation of species, but was often
interrupted by ill-health, and short visits to Dr. Lane's delightful
hydropathic establishment at Moor Park. I abstracted the MS. begun on a
much larger scale in 1856, and completed the volume on the same reduced
scale. It cost me thirteen months and ten days' hard labour. It was
published under the title of the 'Origin of Species,' in November 1859.
Though considerably added to and corrected in the later editions, it has
remained substantially the same book.

It is no doubt the chief work of my life. It was from the first highly
successful. The first small edition of 1250 copies was sold on the day
of publication, and a second edition of 3000 copies soon afterwards.
Sixteen thousand copies have now (1876) been sold in England; and
considering how stiff a book it is, this is a large sale. It has been
translated into almost every European tongue, even into such languages
as Spanish, Bohemian, Polish, and Russian. It has also, according to
Miss Bird, been translated into Japanese (Miss Bird is mistaken, as I
learn from Prof. Mitsukuri.--F.D.), and is there much studied. Even an
essay in Hebrew has appeared on it, showing that the theory is contained
in the Old Testament! The reviews were very numerous; for some time I
collected all that appeared on the 'Origin' and on my related books, and
these amount (excluding newspaper reviews) to 265; but after a time I
gave up the attempt in despair. Many separate essays and books on the
subject have appeared; and in Germany a catalogue or bibliography on
"Darwinismus" has appeared every year or two.

The success of the 'Origin' may, I think, be attributed in large part to
my having long before written two condensed sketches, and to my having
finally abstracted a much larger manuscript, which was itself an
abstract. By this means I was enabled to select the more striking facts
and conclusions. I had, also, during many years followed a golden rule,
namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought
came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a
memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience
that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory
than favourable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were
raised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted
to answer.

It has sometimes been said that the success of the 'Origin' proved "that
the subject was in the air," or "that men's minds were prepared for it."
I do not think that this is strictly true, for I occasionally sounded
not a few naturalists, and never happened to come across a single one
who seemed to doubt about the permanence of species. Even Lyell and
Hooker, though they would listen with interest to me, never seemed to
agree. I tried once or twice to explain to able men what I meant by
Natural Selection, but signally failed. What I believe was strictly
true is that innumerable well-observed facts were stored in the minds
of naturalists ready to take their proper places as soon as any theory
which would receive them was sufficiently explained. Another element
in the success of the book was its moderate size; and this I owe to the
appearance of Mr. Wallace's essay; had I published on the scale in which
I began to write in 1856, the book would have been four or five times as
large as the 'Origin,' and very few would have had the patience to read
it.

I gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory
was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it, for I cared
very little whether men attributed most originality to me or Wallace;
and his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory. I was
forestalled in only one important point, which my vanity has always made
me regret, namely, the explanation by means of the Glacial period of
the presence of the same species of plants and of some few animals on
distant mountain summits and in the arctic regions. This view pleased me
so much that I wrote it out in extenso, and I believe that it was read
by Hooker some years before E. Forbes published his celebrated memoir
('Geolog. Survey Mem.,' 1846.) on the subject. In the very few points in
which we differed, I still think that I was in the right. I have never,
of course, alluded in print to my having independently worked out this
view.

Hardly any point gave me so much satisfaction when I was at work on
the 'Origin,' as the explanation of the wide difference in many classes
between the embryo and the adult animal, and of the close resemblance of
the embryos within the same class. No notice of this point was taken, as
far as I remember, in the early reviews of the 'Origin,' and I recollect
expressing my surprise on this head in a letter to Asa Gray. Within late
years several reviewers have given the whole credit to Fritz Muller and
Hackel, who undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully, and in some
respects more correctly than I did. I had materials for a whole chapter
on the subject, and I ought to have made the discussion longer; for it
is clear that I failed to impress my readers; and he who succeeds in
doing so deserves, in my opinion, all the credit.

This leads me to remark that I have almost always been treated honestly
by my reviewers, passing over those without scientific knowledge as
not worthy of notice. My views have often been grossly misrepresented,
bitterly opposed and ridiculed, but this has been generally done, as I
believe, in good faith. On the whole I do not doubt that my works have
been over and over again greatly overpraised. I rejoice that I have
avoided controversies, and this I owe to Lyell, who many years ago,
in reference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get
entangled in a controversy, as it rarely did any good and caused a
miserable loss of time and temper.

Whenever I have found out that I have blundered, or that my work has
been imperfect, and when I have been contemptuously criticised, and even
when I have been overpraised, so that I have felt mortified, it has
been my greatest comfort to say hundreds of times to myself that "I
have worked as hard and as well as I could, and no man can do more
than this." I remember when in Good Success Bay, in Tierra del Fuego,
thinking (and, I believe, that I wrote home to the effect) that I could
not employ my life better than in adding a little to Natural Science.
This I have done to the best of my abilities, and critics may say what
they like, but they cannot destroy this conviction.

During the two last months of 1859 I was fully occupied in preparing a
second edition of the 'Origin,' and by an enormous correspondence.
On January 1st, 1860, I began arranging my notes for my work on the
'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication;' but it was not
published until the beginning of 1868; the delay having been caused
partly by frequent illnesses, one of which lasted seven months, and
partly by being tempted to publish on other subjects which at the time
interested me more.

On May 15th, 1862, my little book on the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,'
which cost me ten months' work, was published: most of the facts had
been slowly accumulated during several previous years. During the summer
of 1839, and, I believe, during the previous summer, I was led to attend
to the cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from having
come to the conclusion in my speculations on the origin of species, that
crossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant. I
attended to the subject more or less during every subsequent summer; and
my interest in it was greatly enhanced by having procured and read
in November 1841, through the advice of Robert Brown, a copy of C.K.
Sprengel's wonderful book, 'Das entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur.' For
some years before 1862 I had specially attended to the fertilisation
of our British orchids; and it seemed to me the best plan to prepare as
complete a treatise on this group of plants as well as I could, rather
than to utilise the great mass of matter which I had slowly collected
with respect to other plants.

My resolve proved a wise one; for since the appearance of my book, a
surprising number of papers and separate works on the fertilisation of
all kinds of flowers have appeared: and these are far better done than
I could possibly have effected. The merits of poor old Sprengel, so long
overlooked, are now fully recognised many years after his death.

During the same year I published in the 'Journal of the Linnean Society'
a paper "On the Two Forms, or Dimorphic Condition of Primula,"
and during the next five years, five other papers on dimorphic and
trimorphic plants. I do not think anything in my scientific life has
given me so much satisfaction as making out the meaning of the structure
of these plants. I had noticed in 1838 or 1839 the dimorphism of Linum
flavum, and had at first thought that it was merely a case of unmeaning
variability. But on examining the common species of Primula I found that
the two forms were much too regular and constant to be thus viewed. I
therefore became almost convinced that the common cowslip and primrose
were on the high road to become dioecious;--that the short pistil in the
one form, and the short stamens in the other form were tending towards
abortion. The plants were therefore subjected under this point of view
to trial; but as soon as the flowers with short pistils fertilised with
pollen from the short stamens, were found to yield more seeds than any
other of the four possible unions, the abortion-theory was knocked on
the head. After some additional experiment, it became evident that the
two forms, though both were perfect hermaphrodites, bore almost the same
relation to one another as do the two sexes of an ordinary animal. With
Lythrum we have the still more wonderful case of three forms standing in
a similar relation to one another. I afterwards found that the offspring
from the union of two plants belonging to the same forms presented a
close and curious analogy with hybrids from the union of two distinct
species.

In the autumn of 1864 I finished a long paper on 'Climbing Plants,' and
sent it to the Linnean Society. The writing of this paper cost me four
months; but I was so unwell when I received the proof-sheets that I was
forced to leave them very badly and often obscurely expressed. The paper
was little noticed, but when in 1875 it was corrected and published as a
separate book it sold well. I was led to take up this subject by reading
a short paper by Asa Gray, published in 1858. He sent me seeds, and
on raising some plants I was so much fascinated and perplexed by the
revolving movements of the tendrils and stems, which movements are
really very simple, though appearing at first sight very complex, that
I procured various other kinds of climbing plants, and studied the
whole subject. I was all the more attracted to it, from not being at all
satisfied with the explanation which Henslow gave us in his lectures,
about twining plants, namely, that they had a natural tendency to grow
up in a spire. This explanation proved quite erroneous. Some of the
adaptations displayed by Climbing Plants are as beautiful as those of
Orchids for ensuring cross-fertilisation.

My 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' was begun, as
already stated, in the beginning of 1860, but was not published until
the beginning of 1868. It was a big book, and cost me four years and two
months' hard labour. It gives all my observations and an immense number
of facts collected from various sources, about our domestic productions.
In the second volume the causes and laws of variation, inheritance,
etc., are discussed as far as our present state of knowledge permits.
Towards the end of the work I give my well-abused hypothesis of
Pangenesis. An unverified hypothesis is of little or no value; but if
any one should hereafter be led to make observations by which some such
hypothesis could be established, I shall have done good service, as an
astonishing number of isolated facts can be thus connected together and
rendered intelligible. In 1875 a second and largely corrected edition,
which cost me a good deal of labour, was brought out.

My 'Descent of Man' was published in February, 1871. As soon as I had
become, in the year 1837 or 1838, convinced that species were mutable
productions, I could not avoid the belief that man must come under
the same law. Accordingly I collected notes on the subject for my own
satisfaction, and not for a long time with any intention of publishing.
Although in the 'Origin of Species' the derivation of any particular
species is never discussed, yet I thought it best, in order that no
honourable man should accuse me of concealing my views, to add that by
the work "light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history."
It would have been useless and injurious to the success of the book to
have paraded, without giving any evidence, my conviction with respect to
his origin.

But when I found that many naturalists fully accepted the doctrine of
the evolution of species, it seemed to me advisable to work up such
notes as I possessed, and to publish a special treatise on the origin of
man. I was the more glad to do so, as it gave me an opportunity of
fully discussing sexual selection--a subject which had always greatly
interested me. This subject, and that of the variation of our
domestic productions, together with the causes and laws of variation,
inheritance, and the intercrossing of plants, are the sole subjects
which I have been able to write about in full, so as to use all the
materials which I have collected. The 'Descent of Man' took me three
years to write, but then as usual some of this time was lost by ill
health, and some was consumed by preparing new editions and other minor
works. A second and largely corrected edition of the 'Descent' appeared
in 1874.

My book on the 'Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals' was
published in the autumn of 1872. I had intended to give only a chapter
on the subject in the 'Descent of Man,' but as soon as I began to put my
notes together, I saw that it would require a separate treatise.

My first child was born on December 27th, 1839, and I at once commenced
to make notes on the first dawn of the various expressions which he
exhibited, for I felt convinced, even at this early period, that the
most complex and fine shades of expression must all have had a gradual
and natural origin. During the summer of the following year, 1840,
I read Sir C. Bell's admirable work on expression, and this greatly
increased the interest which I felt in the subject, though I could not
at all agree with his belief that various muscles had been specially
created for the sake of expression. From this time forward I
occasionally attended to the subject, both with respect to man and our
domesticated animals. My book sold largely; 5267 copies having been
disposed of on the day of publication.

In the summer of 1860 I was idling and resting near Hartfield, where two
species of Drosera abound; and I noticed that numerous insects had been
entrapped by the leaves. I carried home some plants, and on giving them
insects saw the movements of the tentacles, and this made me think
it probable that the insects were caught for some special purpose.
Fortunately a crucial test occurred to me, that of placing a large
number of leaves in various nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous fluids of
equal density; and as soon as I found that the former alone excited
energetic movements, it was obvious that here was a fine new field for
investigation.

During subsequent years, whenever I had leisure, I pursued my
experiments, and my book on 'Insectivorous Plants' was published in July
1875--that is, sixteen years after my first observations. The delay in
this case, as with all my other books, has been a great advantage to me;
for a man after a long interval can criticise his own work, almost as
well as if it were that of another person. The fact that a plant should
secrete, when properly excited, a fluid containing an acid and ferment,
closely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal, was certainly a
remarkable discovery.

During this autumn of 1876 I shall publish on the 'Effects of Cross
and Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom.' This book will form a
complement to that on the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,' in which I showed
how perfect were the means for cross-fertilisation, and here I shall
show how important are the results. I was led to make, during eleven
years, the numerous experiments recorded in this volume, by a mere
accidental observation; and indeed it required the accident to be
repeated before my attention was thoroughly aroused to the remarkable
fact that seedlings of self-fertilised parentage are inferior, even
in the first generation, in height and vigour to seedlings of
cross-fertilised parentage. I hope also to republish a revised edition
of my book on Orchids, and hereafter my papers on dimorphic and
trimorphic plants, together with some additional observations on allied
points which I never have had time to arrange. My strength will then
probably be exhausted, and I shall be ready to exclaim "Nunc dimittis."

WRITTEN MAY 1ST, 1881.

'The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation' was published in the
autumn of 1876; and the results there arrived at explain, as I believe,
the endless and wonderful contrivances for the transportal of pollen
from one plant to another of the same species. I now believe, however,
chiefly from the observations of Hermann Muller, that I ought to
have insisted more strongly than I did on the many adaptations for
self-fertilisation; though I was well aware of many such adaptations. A
much enlarged edition of my 'Fertilisation of Orchids' was published in
1877.

In this same year 'The Different Forms of Flowers, etc.,' appeared,
and in 1880 a second edition. This book consists chiefly of the several
papers on Heterostyled flowers originally published by the Linnean
Society, corrected, with much new matter added, together with
observations on some other cases in which the same plant bears two kinds
of flowers. As before remarked, no little discovery of mine ever gave me
so much pleasure as the making out the meaning of heterostyled flowers.
The results of crossing such flowers in an illegitimate manner, I
believe to be very important, as bearing on the sterility of hybrids;
although these results have been noticed by only a few persons.

In 1879, I had a translation of Dr. Ernst Krause's 'Life of Erasmus
Darwin' published, and I added a sketch of his character and habits from
material in my possession. Many persons have been much interested by
this little life, and I am surprised that only 800 or 900 copies were
sold.

In 1880 I published, with [my son] Frank's assistance, our 'Power of
Movement in Plants.' This was a tough piece of work. The book bears
somewhat the same relation to my little book on 'Climbing Plants,' which
'Cross-Fertilisation' did to the 'Fertilisation of Orchids;' for in
accordance with the principle of evolution it was impossible to account
for climbing plants having been developed in so many widely different
groups unless all kinds of plants possess some slight power of movement
of an analogous kind. This I proved to be the case; and I was further
led to a rather wide generalisation, viz. that the great and important
classes of movements, excited by light, the attraction of gravity, etc.,
are all modified forms of the fundamental movement of circumnutation. It
has always pleased me to exalt plants in the scale of organised beings;
and I therefore felt an especial pleasure in showing how many and what
admirably well adapted movements the tip of a root possesses.

I have now (May 1, 1881) sent to the printers the MS. of a little book
on 'The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Action of Worms.' This
is a subject of but small importance; and I know not whether it will
interest any readers (Between November 1881 and February 1884, 8500
copies have been sold.), but it has interested me. It is the completion
of a short paper read before the Geological Society more than forty
years ago, and has revived old geological thoughts.

I have now mentioned all the books which I have published, and these
have been the milestones in my life, so that little remains to be said.
I am not conscious of any change in my mind during the last thirty
years, excepting in one point presently to be mentioned; nor, indeed,
could any change have been expected unless one of general deterioration.
But my father lived to his eighty-third year with his mind as lively as
ever it was, and all his faculties undimmed; and I hope that I may die
before my mind fails to a sensible extent. I think that I have become
a little more skilful in guessing right explanations and in devising
experimental tests; but this may probably be the result of mere
practice, and of a larger store of knowledge. I have as much difficulty
as ever in expressing myself clearly and concisely; and this difficulty
has caused me a very great loss of time; but it has had the compensating
advantage of forcing me to think long and intently about every sentence,
and thus I have been led to see errors in reasoning and in my own
observations or those of others.

There seems to be a sort of fatality in my mind leading me to put at
first my statement or proposition in a wrong or awkward form. Formerly
I used to think about my sentences before writing them down; but for
several years I have found that it saves time to scribble in a vile hand
whole pages as quickly as I possibly can, contracting half the words;
and then correct deliberately. Sentences thus scribbled down are often
better ones than I could have written deliberately.

Having said thus much about my manner of writing, I will add that with
my large books I spend a good deal of time over the general arrangement
of the matter. I first make the rudest outline in two or three pages,
and then a larger one in several pages, a few words or one word standing
for a whole discussion or series of facts. Each one of these headings is
again enlarged and often transferred before I begin to write in extenso.
As in several of my books facts observed by others have been very
extensively used, and as I have always had several quite distinct
subjects in hand at the same time, I may mention that I keep from thirty
to forty large portfolios, in cabinets with labelled shelves, into which
I can at once put a detached reference or memorandum. I have bought many
books, and at their ends I make an index of all the facts that concern
my work; or, if the book is not my own, write out a separate abstract,
and of such abstracts I have a large drawer full. Before beginning
on any subject I look to all the short indexes and make a general and
classified index, and by taking the one or more proper portfolios I have
all the information collected during my life ready for use.

I have said that in one respect my mind has changed during the last
twenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty, or beyond it, poetry
of many kinds, such as the works of Milton, Gray, Byron, Wordsworth,
Coleridge, and Shelley, gave me great pleasure, and even as a schoolboy
I took intense delight in Shakespeare, especially in the historical
plays. I have also said that formerly pictures gave me considerable, and
music very great delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to read
a line of poetry: I have tried lately to read Shakespeare, and found
it so intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have also almost lost
my taste for pictures or music. Music generally sets me thinking too
energetically on what I have been at work on, instead of giving me
pleasure. I retain some taste for fine scenery, but it does not cause me
the exquisite delight which it formerly did. On the other hand, novels
which are works of the imagination, though not of a very high order,
have been for years a wonderful relief and pleasure to me, and I often
bless all novelists. A surprising number have been read aloud to me, and
I like all if moderately good, and if they do not end unhappily--against
which a law ought to be passed. A novel, according to my taste, does not
come into the first class unless it contains some person whom one can
thoroughly love, and if a pretty woman all the better.

This curious and lamentable loss of the higher aesthetic tastes is all
the odder, as books on history, biographies, and travels (independently
of any scientific facts which they may contain), and essays on all sorts
of subjects interest me as much as ever they did. My mind seems to
have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large
collections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of
that part of the brain alone, on which the higher tastes depend, I
cannot conceive. A man with a mind more highly organised or better
constituted than mine, would not, I suppose, have thus suffered; and
if I had to live my life again, I would have made a rule to read some
poetry and listen to some music at least once every week; for perhaps
the parts of my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active
through use. The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may
possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral
character, by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature.

My books have sold largely in England, have been translated into many
languages, and passed through several editions in foreign countries. I
have heard it said that the success of a work abroad is the best test
of its enduring value. I doubt whether this is at all trustworthy; but
judged by this standard my name ought to last for a few years. Therefore
it may be worth while to try to analyse the mental qualities and the
conditions on which my success has depended; though I am aware that no
man can do this correctly.

I have no great quickness of apprehension or wit which is so remarkable
in some clever men, for instance, Huxley. I am therefore a poor critic:
a paper or book, when first read, generally excites my admiration,
and it is only after considerable reflection that I perceive the weak
points. My power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought
is very limited; and therefore I could never have succeeded with
metaphysics or mathematics. My memory is extensive, yet hazy: it
suffices to make me cautious by vaguely telling me that I have observed
or read something opposed to the conclusion which I am drawing, or
on the other hand in favour of it; and after a time I can generally
recollect where to search for my authority. So poor in one sense is my
memory, that I have never been able to remember for more than a few days
a single date or a line of poetry.

Some of my critics have said, "Oh, he is a good observer, but he has
no power of reasoning!" I do not think that this can be true, for the
'Origin of Species' is one long argument from the beginning to the end,
and it has convinced not a few able men. No one could have written
it without having some power of reasoning. I have a fair share of
invention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly
successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher
degree.

On the favourable side of the balance, I think that I am superior to the
common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and
in observing them carefully. My industry has been nearly as great as it
could have been in the observation and collection of facts. What is far
more important, my love of natural science has been steady and ardent.

This pure love has, however, been much aided by the ambition to be
esteemed by my fellow naturalists. From my early youth I have had the
strongest desire to understand or explain whatever I observed,--that is,
to group all facts under some general laws. These causes combined have
given me the patience to reflect or ponder for any number of years over
any unexplained problem. As far as I can judge, I am not apt to follow
blindly the lead of other men. I have steadily endeavoured to keep my
mind free so as to give up any hypothesis, however much beloved (and I
cannot resist forming one on every subject), as soon as facts are shown
to be opposed to it. Indeed, I have had no choice but to act in this
manner, for with the exception of the Coral Reefs, I cannot remember a
single first-formed hypothesis which had not after a time to be given
up or greatly modified. This has naturally led me to distrust greatly
deductive reasoning in the mixed sciences. On the other hand, I am not
very sceptical,--a frame of mind which I believe to be injurious to the
progress of science. A good deal of scepticism in a scientific man is
advisable to avoid much loss of time, but I have met with not a few
men, who, I feel sure, have often thus been deterred from experiment
or observations, which would have proved directly or indirectly
serviceable.

In illustration, I will give the oddest case which I have known. A
gentleman (who, as I afterwards heard, is a good local botanist) wrote
to me from the Eastern counties that the seed or beans of the common
field-bean had this year everywhere grown on the wrong side of the pod.
I wrote back, asking for further information, as I did not understand
what was meant; but I did not receive any answer for a very long time.
I then saw in two newspapers, one published in Kent and the other in
Yorkshire, paragraphs stating that it was a most remarkable fact that
"the beans this year had all grown on the wrong side." So I thought
there must be some foundation for so general a statement. Accordingly,
I went to my gardener, an old Kentish man, and asked him whether he had
heard anything about it, and he answered, "Oh, no, sir, it must be a
mistake, for the beans grow on the wrong side only on leap-year, and
this is not leap-year." I then asked him how they grew in common years
and how on leap-years, but soon found that he knew absolutely nothing of
how they grew at any time, but he stuck to his belief.

After a time I heard from my first informant, who, with many apologies,
said that he should not have written to me had he not heard the
statement from several intelligent farmers; but that he had since spoken
again to every one of them, and not one knew in the least what he had
himself meant. So that here a belief--if indeed a statement with no
definite idea attached to it can be called a belief--had spread over
almost the whole of England without any vestige of evidence.

I have known in the course of my life only three intentionally falsified
statements, and one of these may have been a hoax (and there have
been several scientific hoaxes) which, however, took in an American
Agricultural Journal. It related to the formation in Holland of a new
breed of oxen by the crossing of distinct species of Bos (some of which
I happen to know are sterile together), and the author had the impudence
to state that he had corresponded with me, and that I had been deeply
impressed with the importance of his result. The article was sent to me
by the editor of an English Agricultural Journal, asking for my opinion
before republishing it.

A second case was an account of several varieties, raised by the author
from several species of Primula, which had spontaneously yielded a
full complement of seed, although the parent plants had been carefully
protected from the access of insects. This account was published before
I had discovered the meaning of heterostylism, and the whole statement
must have been fraudulent, or there was neglect in excluding insects so
gross as to be scarcely credible.

The third case was more curious: Mr. Huth published in his book on
'Consanguineous Marriage' some long extracts from a Belgian author, who
stated that he had interbred rabbits in the closest manner for very
many generations, without the least injurious effects. The account was
published in a most respectable Journal, that of the Royal Society of
Belgium; but I could not avoid feeling doubts--I hardly know why, except
that there were no accidents of any kind, and my experience in breeding
animals made me think this very improbable.

So with much hesitation I wrote to Professor Van Beneden, asking him
whether the author was a trustworthy man. I soon heard in answer that
the Society had been greatly shocked by discovering that the whole
account was a fraud. (The falseness of the published statements on which
Mr. Huth relied has been pointed out by himself in a slip inserted in
all the copies of his book which then remained unsold.) The writer had
been publicly challenged in the Journal to say where he had resided and
kept his large stock of rabbits while carrying on his experiments, which
must have consumed several years, and no answer could be extracted from
him.

My habits are methodical, and this has been of not a little use for
my particular line of work. Lastly, I have had ample leisure from not
having to earn my own bread. Even ill-health, though it has annihilated
several years of my life, has saved me from the distractions of society
and amusement.

Therefore my success as a man of science, whatever this may have
amounted to, has been determined, as far as I can judge, by complex
and diversified mental qualities and conditions. Of these, the most
important have been--the love of science--unbounded patience in long
reflecting over any subject--industry in observing and collecting
facts--and a fair share of invention as well as of common sense. With
such moderate abilities as I possess, it is truly surprising that I
should have influenced to a considerable extent the belief of scientific
men on some important points.




CHAPTER 1.III. -- REMINISCENCES OF MY FATHER'S EVERYDAY LIFE.

It is my wish in the present chapter to give some idea of my father's
everyday life. It has seemed to me that I might carry out this object
in the form of a rough sketch of a day's life at Down, interspersed
with such recollections as are called up by the record. Many of these
recollections, which have a meaning for those who knew my father, will
seem colourless or trifling to strangers. Nevertheless, I give them
in the hope that they may help to preserve that impression of his
personality which remains on the minds of those who knew and loved
him--an impression at once so vivid and so untranslatable into words.

Of his personal appearance (in these days of multiplied photographs) it
is hardly necessary to say much. He was about six feet in height, but
scarcely looked so tall, as he stooped a good deal; in later days he
yielded to the stoop; but I can remember seeing him long ago swinging
his arms back to open out his chest, and holding himself upright with a
jerk. He gave one the idea that he had been active rather than strong;
his shoulders were not broad for his height, though certainly not
narrow. As a young man he must have had much endurance, for on one of
the shore excursions from the "Beagle", when all were suffering from
want of water, he was one of the two who were better able than the rest
to struggle on in search of it. As a boy he was active, and could jump a
bar placed at the height of the "Adam's apple" in his neck.

He walked with a swinging action, using a stick heavily shod with iron,
which he struck loudly against the ground, producing as he went round
the "Sand-walk" at Down, a rhythmical click which is with all of us a
very distinct remembrance. As he returned from the midday walk, often
carrying the waterproof or cloak which had proved too hot, one could see
that the swinging step was kept up by something of an effort. Indoors
his step was often slow and laboured, and as he went upstairs in the
afternoon he might be heard mounting the stairs with a heavy footfall,
as if each step were an effort. When interested in his work he moved
about quickly and easily enough, and often in the middle of dictating
he went eagerly into the hall to get a pinch of snuff, leaving the study
door open, and calling out the last words of his sentence as he went.
Indoors he sometimes used an oak stick like a little alpenstock, and
this was a sign that he felt giddiness.

In spite of his strength and activity, I think he must always have had a
clumsiness of movement. He was naturally awkward with his hands, and
was unable to draw at all well. (The figure representing the aggregated
cell-contents in 'Insectivorous Plants' was drawn by him.) This he
always regretted much, and he frequently urged the paramount necessity
of a young naturalist making himself a good draughtsman.

He could dissect well under the simple microscope, but I think it was by
dint of his great patience and carefulness. It was characteristic of him
that he thought many little bits of skilful dissection something almost
superhuman. He used to speak with admiration of the skill with which he
saw Newport dissect a humble bee, getting out the nervous system with
a few cuts of a fine pair of scissors, held, as my father used to show,
with the elbow raised, and in an attitude which certainly would render
great steadiness necessary. He used to consider cutting sections a great
feat, and in the last year of his life, with wonderful energy, took the
pains to learn to cut sections of roots and leaves. His hand was not
steady enough to hold the object to be cut, and he employed a common
microtome, in which the pith for holding the object was clamped, and the
razor slid on a glass surface in making the sections. He used to laugh
at himself, and at his own skill in section-cutting, at which he would
say he was "speechless with admiration." On the other hand, he must have
had accuracy of eye and power of co-ordinating his movements, since he
was a good shot with a gun as a young man, and as a boy was skilful
in throwing. He once killed a hare sitting in the flower-garden at
Shrewsbury by throwing a marble at it, and, as a man, he once killed a
cross-beak with a stone. He was so unhappy at having uselessly killed
the cross-beak that he did not mention it for years, and then explained
that he should never have thrown at it if he had not felt sure that his
old skill had gone from him.

When walking he had a fidgetting movement with his fingers, which he has
described in one of his books as the habit of an old man. When he sat
still he often took hold of one wrist with the other hand; he sat with
his legs crossed, and from being so thin they could be crossed very far,
as may be seen in one of the photographs. He had his chair in the study
and in the drawing-room raised so as to be much higher than ordinary
chairs; this was done because sitting on a low or even an ordinary chair
caused him some discomfort. We used to laugh at him for making his tall
drawing-room chair still higher by putting footstools on it, and then
neutralising the result by resting his feet on another chair.

His beard was full and almost untrimmed, the hair being grey and
white, fine rather than coarse, and wavy or frizzled. His moustache was
somewhat disfigured by being cut short and square across. He became very
bald, having only a fringe of dark hair behind.

His face was ruddy in colour, and this perhaps made people think him
less of an invalid than he was. He wrote to Dr. Hooker (June 13, 1849),
"Every one tells me that I look quite blooming and beautiful; and most
think I am shamming, but you have never been one of those." And it must
be remembered that at this time he was miserably ill, far worse than
in later years. His eyes were bluish grey under deep overhanging
brows, with thick bushy projecting eyebrows. His high forehead was
much wrinkled, but otherwise his face was not much marked or lined. His
expression showed no signs of the continual discomfort he suffered.

When he was excited with pleasant talk his whole manner was wonderfully
bright and animated, and his face shared to the full in the general
animation. His laugh was a free and sounding peal, like that of a man
who gives himself sympathetically and with enjoyment to the person and
the thing which have amused him. He often used some sort of gesture
with his laugh, lifting up his hands or bringing one down with a slap.
I think, generally speaking, he was given to gesture, and often used his
hands in explaining anything (e.g. the fertilisation of a flower) in a
way that seemed rather an aid to himself than to the listener. He did
this on occasions when most people would illustrate their explanations
by means of a rough pencil sketch.

He wore dark clothes, of a loose and easy fit. Of late years he gave up
the tall hat even in London, and wore a soft black one in winter, and
a big straw hat in summer. His usual out-of-doors dress was the short
cloak in which Elliot and Fry's photograph represents him leaning
against the pillar of the verandah. Two peculiarities of his indoor
dress were that he almost always wore a shawl over his shoulders, and
that he had great loose cloth boots lined with fur which he could slip
on over his indoor shoes. Like most delicate people he suffered from
heat as well as from chilliness; it was as if he could not hit the
balance between too hot and too cold; often a mental cause would make
him too hot, so that he would take off his coat if anything went wrong
in the course of his work.

He rose early, chiefly because he could not lie in bed, and I think he
would have liked to get up earlier than he did. He took a short turn
before breakfast, a habit which began when he went for the first time to
a water-cure establishment. This habit he kept up till almost the end
of his life. I used, as a little boy, to like going out with him, and I
have a vague sense of the red of the winter sunrise, and a recollection
of the pleasant companionship, and a certain honour and glory in it. He
used to delight me as a boy by telling me how, in still earlier walks,
on dark winter mornings, he had once or twice met foxes trotting home at
the dawning.

After breakfasting alone about 7.45, he went to work at once,
considering the 1 1/2 hour between 8 and 9.30 one of his best working
times. At 9.30 he came into the drawing-room for his letters--rejoicing
if the post was a light one and being sometimes much worried if it was
not. He would then hear any family letters read aloud as he lay on the
sofa.

The reading aloud, which also included part of a novel, lasted till
about half-past ten, when he went back to work till twelve or a quarter
past. By this time he considered his day's work over, and would often
say, in a satisfied voice, "I'VE done a good day's work." He then went
out of doors whether it was wet or fine; Polly, his white terrier,
went with him in fair weather, but in rain she refused or might be seen
hesitating in the verandah, with a mixed expression of disgust and shame
at her own want of courage; generally, however, her conscience carried
the day, and as soon as he was evidently gone she could not bear to stay
behind.

My father was always fond of dogs, and as a young man had the power of
stealing away the affections of his sister's pets; at Cambridge, he won
the love of his cousin W.D. Fox's dog, and this may perhaps have been
the little beast which used to creep down inside his bed and sleep at
the foot every night. My father had a surly dog, who was devoted to
him, but unfriendly to every one else, and when he came back from the
"Beagle" voyage, the dog remembered him, but in a curious way, which my
father was fond of telling. He went into the yard and shouted in his old
manner; the dog rushed out and set off with him on his walk, showing no
more emotion or excitement than if the same thing had happened the day
before, instead of five years ago. This story is made use of in the
'Descent of Man,' 2nd Edition, page 74.

In my memory there were only two dogs which had much connection with my
father. One was a large black and white half-bred retriever, called Bob,
to which we, as children, were much devoted. He was the dog of whom
the story of the "hot-house face" is told in the 'Expression of the
Emotions.'

But the dog most closely associated with my father was the
above-mentioned Polly, a rough, white fox-terrier. She was a
sharp-witted, affectionate dog; when her master was going away on a
journey, she always discovered the fact by the signs of packing going on
in the study, and became low-spirited accordingly. She began, too, to
be excited by seeing the study prepared for his return home. She was a
cunning little creature, and used to tremble or put on an air of misery
when my father passed, while she was waiting for dinner, just as if she
knew that he would say (as he did often say) that "she was famishing."
My father used to make her catch biscuits off her nose, and had an
affectionate and mock-solemn way of explaining to her before-hand that
she must "be a very good girl." She had a mark on her back where she had
been burnt, and where the hair had re-grown red instead of white, and my
father used to commend her for this tuft of hair as being in accordance
with his theory of pangenesis; her father had been a red bull-terrier,
thus the red hair appearing after the burn showed the presence of latent
red gemmules. He was delightfully tender to Polly, and never showed any
impatience at the attentions she required, such as to be let in at the
door, or out at the verandah window, to bark at "naughty people,"
a self-imposed duty she much enjoyed. She died, or rather had to be
killed, a few days after his death. (The basket in which she usually lay
curled up near the fire in his study is faithfully represented in Mr.
Parson's drawing, "The Study at Down.")

My father's midday walk generally began by a call at the greenhouse,
where he looked at any germinating seeds or experimental plants which
required a casual examination, but he hardly ever did any serious
observing at this time. Then he went on for his constitutional--either
round the "Sand-walk," or outside his own grounds in the immediate
neighbourhood of the house. The "Sand-walk" was a narrow strip of land 1
1/2 acres in extent, with a gravel-walk round it. On one side of it
was a broad old shaw with fair-sized oaks in it, which made a sheltered
shady walk; the other side was separated from a neighbouring grass field
by a low quickset hedge, over which you could look at what view there
was, a quiet little valley losing itself in the upland country towards
the edge of the Westerham hill, with hazel coppice and larch wood, the
remnants of what was once a large wood, stretching away to the Westerham
road. I have heard my father say that the charm of this simple little
valley helped to make him settle at Down.

The Sand-walk was planted by my father with a variety of trees, such
as hazel, alder, lime, hornbeam, birch, privet, and dogwood, and with a
long line of hollies all down the exposed side. In earlier times he took
a certain number of turns every day, and used to count them by means of
a heap of flints, one of which he kicked out on the path each time he
passed. Of late years I think he did not keep to any fixed number of
turns, but took as many as he felt strength for. The Sand-walk was our
play-ground as children, and here we continually saw my father as he
walked round. He liked to see what we were doing, and was ever ready
to sympathize in any fun that was going on. It is curious to think how,
with regard to the Sand-walk in connection with my father, my earliest
recollections coincide with my latest; it shows how unvarying his habits
have been.

Sometimes when alone he stood still or walked stealthily to observe
birds or beasts. It was on one of these occasions that some young
squirrels ran up his back and legs, while their mother barked at them in
an agony from the tree. He always found birds' nests even up to the last
years of his life, and we, as children, considered that he had a special
genius in this direction. In his quiet prowls he came across the less
common birds, but I fancy he used to conceal it from me, as a little
boy, because he observed the agony of mind which I endured at not having
seen the siskin or goldfinch, or whatever it might have been. He used to
tell us how, when he was creeping noiselessly along in the "Big-Woods,"
he came upon a fox asleep in the daytime, which was so much astonished
that it took a good stare at him before it ran off. A Spitz dog which
accompanied him showed no sign of excitement at the fox, and he used to
end the story by wondering how the dog could have been so faint-hearted.

Another favourite place was "Orchis Bank," above the quiet Cudham
valley, where fly- and musk-orchis grew among the junipers, and
Cephalanthera and Neottia under the beech boughs; the little wood
"Hangrove," just above this, he was also fond of, and here I remember
his collecting grasses, when he took a fancy to make out the names of
all the common kinds. He was fond of quoting the saying of one of his
little boys, who, having found a grass that his father had not seen
before, had it laid by his own plate during dinner, remarking, "I are an
extraordinary grass-finder!"

My father much enjoyed wandering slowly in the garden with my mother or
some of his children, or making one of a party, sitting out on a bench
on the lawn; he generally sat, however, on the grass, and I remember him
often lying under one of the big lime-trees, with his head on the green
mound at its foot. In dry summer weather, when we often sat out, the
big fly-wheel of the well was commonly heard spinning round, and so the
sound became associated with those pleasant days. He used to like to
watch us playing at lawn-tennis, and often knocked up a stray ball for
us with the curved handle of his stick. === Though he took no personal
share in the management of the garden, he had great delight in the
beauty of flowers--for instance, in the mass of Azaleas which generally
stood in the drawing-room. I think he sometimes fused together his
admiration of the structure of a flower and of its intrinsic beauty;
for instance, in the case of the big pendulous pink and white flowers
of Dielytra. In the same way he had an affection, half-artistic,
half-botanical, for the little blue Lobelia. In admiring flowers, he
would often laugh at the dingy high-art colours, and contrast them with
the bright tints of nature. I used to like to hear him admire the beauty
of a flower; it was a kind of gratitude to the flower itself, and a
personal love for its delicate form and colour. I seem to remember
him gently touching a flower he delighted in; it was the same simple
admiration that a child might have.

He could not help personifying natural things. This feeling came out in
abuse as well as in praise--e.g. of some seedlings--"The little
beggars are doing just what I don't want them to." He would speak in a
half-provoked, half-admiring way of the ingenuity of a Mimosa leaf in
screwing itself out of a basin of water in which he had tried to fix
it. One must see the same spirit in his way of speaking of Sundew,
earth-worms, etc. (Cf. Leslie Stephen's 'Swift,' 1882, page 200, where
Swift's inspection of the manners and customs of servants are compared
to my father's observations on worms, "The difference is," says Mr.
Stephen, "that Darwin had none but kindly feelings for worms.")

Within my memory, his only outdoor recreation, besides walking, was
riding, which he took to on the recommendation of Dr. Bence Jones, and
we had the luck to find for him the easiest and quietest cob in the
world, named "Tommy." He enjoyed these rides extremely, and devised a
number of short rounds which brought him home in time for lunch. Our
country is good for this purpose, owing to the number of small valleys
which give a variety to what in a flat country would be a dull loop of
road. He was not, I think, naturally fond of horses, nor had he a high
opinion of their intelligence, and Tommy was often laughed at for
the alarm he showed at passing and repassing the same heap of
hedge-clippings as he went round the field. I think he used to feel
surprised at himself, when he remembered how bold a rider he had been,
and how utterly old age and bad health had taken away his nerve. He
would say that riding prevented him thinking much more effectually
than walking--that having to attend to the horse gave him occupation
sufficient to prevent any really hard thinking. And the change of scene
which it gave him was good for spirits and health.

Unluckily, Tommy one day fell heavily with him on Keston common. This,
and an accident with another horse, upset his nerves, and he was advised
to give up riding.

If I go beyond my own experience, and recall what I have heard him say
of his love for sport, etc., I can think of a good deal, but much of it
would be a repetition of what is contained in his 'Recollections.' At
school he was fond of bat-fives, and this was the only game at which he
was skilful. He was fond of his gun as quite a boy, and became a good
shot; he used to tell how in South America he killed twenty-three snipe
in twenty-four shots. In telling the story he was careful to add that he
thought they were not quite so wild as English snipe.

Luncheon at Down came after his midday walk; and here I may say a word
or two about his meals generally. He had a boy-like love of sweets,
unluckily for himself, since he was constantly forbidden to take them.
He was not particularly successful in keeping the "vows," as he called
them, which he made against eating sweets, and never considered them
binding unless he made them aloud.

He drank very little wine, but enjoyed, and was revived by, the little
he did drink. He had a horror of drinking, and constantly warned his
boys that any one might be led into drinking too much. I remember, in my
innocence as a small boy, asking him if he had been ever tipsy; and he
answered very gravely that he was ashamed to say he had once drunk too
much at Cambridge. I was much impressed, so that I know now the place
where the question was asked.

After his lunch, he read the newspaper, lying on the sofa in the
drawing-room. I think the paper was the only non-scientific matter which
he read to himself. Everything else, novels, travels, history, was read
aloud to him. He took so wide an interest in life, that there was much
to occupy him in newspapers, though he laughed at the wordiness of
the debates; reading them, I think, only in abstract. His interest in
politics was considerable, but his opinion on these matters was formed
rather by the way than with any serious amount of thought.

After he read his paper, came his time for writing letters. These, as
well as the MS. of his books, were written by him as he sat in a huge
horse-hair chair by the fire, his paper supported on a board resting
on the arms of the chair. When he had many or long letters to write, he
would dictate them from a rough copy; these rough copies were written on
the backs of manuscript or of proof-sheets, and were almost illegible,
sometimes even to himself. He made a rule of keeping ALL letters that he
received; this was a habit which he learnt from his father, and which he
said had been of great use to him.

He received many letters from foolish, unscrupulous people, and all of
these received replies. He used to say that if he did not answer them,
he had it on his conscience afterwards, and no doubt it was in great
measure the courtesy with which he answered every one, which produced
the universal and widespread sense of his kindness of nature, which was
so evident on his death.

He was considerate to his correspondents in other and lesser things, for
instance when dictating a letter to a foreigner he hardly ever failed
to say to me, "You'd better try and write well, as it's to a foreigner."
His letters were generally written on the assumption that they would be
carelessly read; thus, when he was dictating, he was careful to tell me
to make an important clause begin with an obvious paragraph "to catch
his eye," as he often said. How much he thought of the trouble he gave
others by asking questions, will be well enough shown by his letters. It
is difficult to say anything about the general tone of his letters,
they will speak for themselves. The unvarying courtesy of them is very
striking. I had a proof of this quality in the feeling with which Mr.
Hacon, his solicitor, regarded him. He had never seen my father, yet
had a sincere feeling of friendship for him, and spoke especially of
his letters as being such as a man seldom receives in the way of
business:--"Everything I did was right, and everything was profusely
thanked for."

He had a printed form to be used in replying to troublesome
correspondents, but he hardly ever used it; I suppose he never found an
occasion that seemed exactly suitable. I remember an occasion on which
it might have been used with advantage. He received a letter from a
stranger stating that the writer had undertaken to uphold Evolution at
a debating society, and that being a busy young man, without time for
reading, he wished to have a sketch of my father's views. Even this
wonderful young man got a civil answer, though I think he did not get
much material for his speech. His rule was to thank the donors of books,
but not of pamphlets. He sometimes expressed surprise that so few people
thanked him for his books which he gave away liberally; the letters that
he did receive gave him much pleasure, because he habitually formed so
humble an estimate of the value of all his works, that he was generally
surprised at the interest which they excited.

In money and business matters he was remarkably careful and exact. He
kept accounts with great care, classifying them, and balancing at the
end of the year like a merchant. I remember the quick way in which
he would reach out for his account-book to enter each cheque paid, as
though he were in a hurry to get it entered before he had forgotten it.
His father must have allowed him to believe that he would be poorer than
he really was, for some of the difficulty experienced in finding a house
in the country must have arisen from the modest sum he felt prepared to
give. Yet he knew, of course, that he would be in easy circumstances,
for in his 'Recollections' he mentions this as one of the reasons for
his not having worked at medicine with so much zeal as he would have
done if he had been obliged to gain his living.

He had a pet economy in paper, but it was rather a hobby than a real
economy. All the blank sheets of letters received were kept in a
portfolio to be used in making notes; it was his respect for paper that
made him write so much on the backs of his old MS., and in this way,
unfortunately, he destroyed large parts of the original MS. of his
books. His feeling about paper extended to waste paper, and he objected,
half in fun, to the careless custom of throwing a spill into the fire
after it had been used for lighting a candle.

My father was wonderfully liberal and generous to all his children in
the matter of money, and I have special cause to remember his kindness
when I think of the way in which he paid some Cambridge debts of
mine--making it almost seem a virtue in me to have told him of them.
In his later years he had the kind and generous plan of dividing his
surplus at the year's end among his children.

He had a great respect for pure business capacity, and often spoke with
admiration of a relative who had doubled his fortune. And of himself
would often say in fun that what he really WAS proud of was the money he
had saved. He also felt satisfaction in the money he made by his books.
His anxiety to save came in a great measure from his fears that his
children would not have health enough to earn their own livings, a
foreboding which fairly haunted him for many years. And I have a dim
recollection of his saying, "Thank God, you'll have bread and cheese,"
when I was so young that I was rather inclined to take it literally.

When letters were finished, about three in the afternoon, he rested in
his bedroom, lying on the sofa and smoking a cigarette, and listening
to a novel or other book not scientific. He only smoked when resting,
whereas snuff was a stimulant, and was taken during working hours.
He took snuff for many years of his life, having learnt the habit at
Edinburgh as a student. He had a nice silver snuff-box given him by
Mrs. Wedgwood of Maer, which he valued much--but he rarely carried it,
because it tempted him to take too many pinches. In one of his early
letters he speaks of having given up snuff for a month, and describes
himself as feeling "most lethargic, stupid, and melancholy." Our former
neighbour and clergyman, Mr. Brodie Innes, tells me that at one time my
father made a resolve not to take snuff except away from home, "a most
satisfactory arrangement for me," he adds, "as I kept a box in my study
to which there was access from the garden without summoning servants,
and I had more frequently, than might have been otherwise the case,
the privilege of a few minutes' conversation with my dear friend." He
generally took snuff from a jar on the hall table, because having to go
this distance for a pinch was a slight check; the clink of the lid of
the snuff jar was a very familiar sound. Sometimes when he was in the
drawing-room, it would occur to him that the study fire must be burning
low, and when some of us offered to see after it, it would turn out that
he also wished to get a pinch of snuff.

Smoking he only took to permanently of late years, though on his Pampas
rides he learned to smoke with the Gauchos, and I have heard him speak
of the great comfort of a cup of mate and a cigarette when he halted
after a long ride and was unable to get food for some time.

The reading aloud often sent him to sleep, and he used to regret losing
parts of a novel, for my mother went steadily on lest the cessation of
the sound might wake him. He came down at four o'clock to dress for
his walk, and he was so regular that one might be quite certain it was
within a few minutes of four when his descending steps were heard.

From about half-past four to half-past five he worked; then he came to
the drawing-room, and was idle till it was time (about six) to go up for
another rest with novel-reading and a cigarette.

Latterly he gave up late dinner, and had a simple tea at half-past
seven (while we had dinner), with an egg or a small piece of meat. After
dinner he never stayed in the room, and used to apologise by saying he
was an old woman, who must be allowed to leave with the ladies. This
was one of the many signs and results of his constant weakness and
ill-health. Half an hour more or less conversation would make to him
the difference of a sleepless night, and of the loss perhaps of half the
next day's work.

After dinner he played backgammon with my mother, two games being played
every night; for many years a score of the games which each won was
kept, and in this score he took the greatest interest. He became
extremely animated over these games, bitterly lamenting his bad luck and
exploding with exaggerated mock-anger at my mother's good fortune.

After backgammon he read some scientific book to himself, either in the
drawing-room, or, if much talking was going on, in the study.

In the evening, that is, after he had read as much as his strength would
allow, and before the reading aloud began, he would often lie on the
sofa and listen to my mother playing the piano. He had not a good ear,
yet in spite of this he had a true love of fine music. He used to lament
that his enjoyment of music had become dulled with age, yet within my
recollection, his love of a good tune was strong. I never heard him hum
more than one tune, the Welsh song "Ar hyd y nos," which he went through
correctly; he used also, I believe, to hum a little Otaheitan song.
From his want of ear he was unable to recognize a tune when he heard it
again, but he remained constant to what he liked, and would often say,
when an old favourite was played, "That's a fine thing; what is it?" He
liked especially parts of Beethoven's symphonies, and bits of Handel.
He made a little list of all the pieces which he especially liked among
those which my mother played--giving in a few words the impression that
each one made on him--but these notes are unfortunately lost. He was
sensitive to differences in style, and enjoyed the late Mrs. Vernon
Lushington's playing intensely, and in June 1881, when Hans Richter paid
a visit at Down, he was roused to strong enthusiasm by his magnificent
performance on the piano. He much enjoyed good singing, and was moved
almost to tears by grand or pathetic songs. His niece Lady Farrer's
singing of Sullivan's "Will he come" was a never-failing enjoyment
to him. He was humble in the extreme about his own taste, and
correspondingly pleased when he found that others agreed with him.

He became much tired in the evenings, especially of late years, when
he left the drawing-room about ten, going to bed at half-past ten. His
nights were generally bad, and he often lay awake or sat up in bed
for hours, suffering much discomfort. He was troubled at night by the
activity of his thoughts, and would become exhausted by his mind working
at some problem which he would willingly have dismissed. At night, too,
anything which had vexed or troubled him in the day would haunt him,
and I think it was then that he suffered if he had not answered some
troublesome person's letter.

The regular readings, which I have mentioned, continued for so many
years, enabled him to get through a great deal of lighter kinds of
literature. He was extremely fond of novels, and I remember well the way
in which he would anticipate the pleasure of having a novel read to him,
as he lay down, or lighted his cigarette. He took a vivid interest both
in plot and characters, and would on no account know beforehand, how
a story finished; he considered looking at the end of a novel as a
feminine vice. He could not enjoy any story with a tragical end, for
this reason he did not keenly appreciate George Eliot, though he often
spoke warmly in praise of 'Silas Marner.' Walter Scott, Miss Austen, and
Mrs. Gaskell, were read and re-read till they could be read no more. He
had two or three books in hand at the same time--a novel and perhaps a
biography and a book of travels. He did not often read out-of-the-way or
old standard books, but generally kept to the books of the day obtained
from a circulating library.

I do not think that his literary tastes and opinions were on a level
with the rest of his mind. He himself, though he was clear as to what he
thought good, considered that in matters of literary taste, he was
quite outside the pale, and often spoke of what those within it liked or
disliked, as if they formed a class to which he had no claim to belong.

In all matters of art he was inclined to laugh at professed critics,
and say that their opinions were formed by fashion. Thus in painting,
he would say how in his day every one admired masters who are now
neglected. His love of pictures as a young man is almost a proof that he
must have had an appreciation of a portrait as a work of art, not as
a likeness. Yet he often talked laughingly of the small worth of
portraits, and said that a photograph was worth any number of pictures,
as if he were blind to the artistic quality in a painted portrait. But
this was generally said in his attempts to persuade us to give up the
idea of having his portrait painted, an operation very irksome to him.

This way of looking at himself as an ignoramus in all matters of art,
was strengthened by the absence of pretence, which was part of his
character. With regard to questions of taste, as well as to more serious
things, he always had the courage of his opinions. I remember, however,
an instance that sounds like a contradiction to this: when he was
looking at the Turners in Mr. Ruskin's bedroom, he did not confess, as
he did afterwards, that he could make out absolutely nothing of what Mr.
Ruskin saw in them. But this little pretence was not for his own sake,
but for the sake of courtesy to his host. He was pleased and amused
when subsequently Mr. Ruskin brought him some photographs of pictures
(I think Vandyke portraits), and courteously seemed to value my father's
opinion about them.

Much of his scientific reading was in German, and this was a great
labour to him; in reading a book after him, I was often struck at
seeing, from the pencil-marks made each day where he left off, how
little he could read at a time. He used to call German the "Verdammte,"
pronounced as if in English. He was especially indignant with Germans,
because he was convinced that they could write simply if they chose, and
often praised Dr. F. Hildebrand for writing German which was as clear
as French. He sometimes gave a German sentence to a friend, a patriotic
German lady, and used to laugh at her if she did not translate it
fluently. He himself learnt German simply by hammering away with a
dictionary; he would say that his only way was to read a sentence a
great many times over, and at last the meaning occurred to him. When he
began German long ago, he boasted of the fact (as he used to tell) to
Sir J. Hooker, who replied, "Ah, my dear fellow, that's nothing; I've
begun it many times."

In spite of his want of grammar, he managed to get on wonderfully with
German, and the sentences that he failed to make out were generally
really difficult ones. He never attempted to speak German correctly, but
pronounced the words as though they were English; and this made it not
a little difficult to help him, when he read out a German sentence and
asked for a translation. He certainly had a bad ear for vocal sounds,
so that he found it impossible to perceive small differences in
pronunciation.

His wide interest in branches of science that were not specially his own
was remarkable. In the biological sciences his doctrines make themselves
felt so widely that there was something interesting to him in most
departments of it. He read a good deal of many quite special works, and
large parts of text books, such as Huxley's 'Invertebrate Anatomy,' or
such a book as Balfour's 'Embryology,' where the detail, at any rate,
was not specially in his own line. And in the case of elaborate books of
the monograph type, though he did not make a study of them, yet he felt
the strongest admiration for them.

In the non-biological sciences he felt keen sympathy with work of which
he could not really judge. For instance, he used to read nearly the
whole of 'Nature,' though so much of it deals with mathematics and
physics. I have often heard him say that he got a kind of satisfaction
in reading articles which (according to himself) he could not
understand. I wish I could reproduce the manner in which he would laugh
at himself for it.

It was remarkable, too, how he kept up his interest in subjects at which
he had formerly worked. This was strikingly the case with geology. In
one of his letters to Mr. Judd he begs him to pay him a visit, saying
that since Lyell's death he hardly ever gets a geological talk. His
observations, made only a few years before his death, on the upright
pebbles in the drift at Southampton, and discussed in a letter to Mr.
Geikie, afford another instance. Again, in the letters to Dr. Dohrn, he
shows how his interest in barnacles remained alive. I think it was all
due to the vitality and persistence of his mind--a quality I have heard
him speak of as if he felt that he was strongly gifted in that respect.
Not that he used any such phrases as these about himself, but he would
say that he had the power of keeping a subject or question more or less
before him for a great many years. The extent to which he possessed this
power appears when we consider the number of different problems which he
solved, and the early period at which some of them began to occupy him.

It was a sure sign that he was not well when he was idle at any times
other than his regular resting hours; for, as long as he remained
moderately well, there was no break in the regularity of his life.
Week-days and Sundays passed by alike, each with their stated intervals
of work and rest. It is almost impossible, except for those who watched
his daily life, to realise how essential to his well-being was the
regular routine that I have sketched: and with what pain and difficulty
anything beyond it was attempted. Any public appearance, even of the
most modest kind, was an effort to him. In 1871 he went to the little
village church for the wedding of his elder daughter, but he could
hardly bear the fatigue of being present through the short service. The
same may be said of the few other occasions on which he was present at
similar ceremonies.

I remember him many years ago at a christening; a memory which has
remained with me, because to us children it seemed an extraordinary and
abnormal occurrence. I remember his look most distinctly at his brother
Erasmus's funeral, as he stood in the scattering of snow, wrapped in a
long black funeral cloak, with a grave look of sad reverie.

When, after an interval of many years, he again attended a meeting
of the Linnean Society, it was felt to be, and was in fact, a serious
undertaking; one not to be determined on without much sinking of
heart, and hardly to be carried into effect without paying a penalty
of subsequent suffering. In the same way a breakfast-party at Sir James
Paget's, with some of the distinguished visitors to the Medical Congress
(1881), was to him a severe exertion.

The early morning was the only time at which he could make any effort of
the kind, with comparative impunity. Thus it came about that the visits
he paid to his scientific friends in London were by preference made
as early as ten in the morning. For the same reason he started on his
journeys by the earliest possible train, and used to arrive at the
houses of relatives in London when they were beginning their day.

He kept an accurate journal of the days on which he worked and those
on which his ill health prevented him from working, so that it would
be possible to tell how many were idle days in any given year. In
this journal--a little yellow Lett's Diary, which lay open on his
mantel-piece, piled on the diaries of previous years--he also entered
the day on which he started for a holiday and that of his return.

The most frequent holidays were visits of a week to London, either
to his brother's house (6 Queen Anne Street), or to his daughter's (4
Bryanston Street). He was generally persuaded by my mother to take these
short holidays, when it became clear from the frequency of "bad days,"
or from the swimming of his head, that he was being overworked. He
went unwillingly, and tried to drive hard bargains, stipulating, for
instance, that he should come home in five days instead of six. Even
if he were leaving home for no more than a week, the packing had to be
begun early on the previous day, and the chief part of it he would do
himself. The discomfort of a journey to him was, at least latterly,
chiefly in the anticipation, and in the miserable sinking feeling from
which he suffered immediately before the start; even a fairly long
journey, such as that to Coniston, tired him wonderfully little,
considering how much an invalid he was; and he certainly enjoyed it in
an almost boyish way, and to a curious extent.

Although, as he has said, some of his aesthetic tastes had suffered a
gradual decay, his love of scenery remained fresh and strong. Every walk
at Coniston was a fresh delight, and he was never tired of praising the
beauty of the broken hilly country at the head of the lake.

One of the happy memories of this time [1879] is that of a delightful
visit to Grasmere: "The perfect day," my sister writes, "and my father's
vivid enjoyment and flow of spirits, form a picture in my mind that I
like to think of. He could hardly sit still in the carriage for turning
round and getting up to admire the view from each fresh point, and even
in returning he was full of the beauty of Rydal Water, though he would
not allow that Grasmere at all equalled his beloved Coniston."

Besides these longer holidays, there were shorter visits to various
relatives--to his brother-in-law's house, close to Leith Hill, and to
his son near Southampton. He always particularly enjoyed rambling over
rough open country, such as the commons near Leith Hill and Southampton,
the heath-covered wastes of Ashdown Forest, or the delightful "Rough"
near the house of his friend Sir Thomas Farrer. He never was quite idle
even on these holidays, and found things to observe. At Hartfield he
watched Drosera catching insects, etc.; at Torquay he observed the
fertilisation of an orchid (Spiranthes), and also made out the relations
of the sexes in Thyme.

He was always rejoiced to get home after his holidays; he used greatly
to enjoy the welcome he got from his dog Polly, who would get wild with
excitement, panting, squeaking, rushing round the room, and jumping on
and off the chairs; and he used to stoop down, pressing her face to
his, letting her lick him, and speaking to her with a peculiarly tender,
caressing voice.

My father had the power of giving to these summer holidays a charm which
was strongly felt by all his family. The pressure of his work at home
kept him at the utmost stretch of his powers of endurance, and when
released from it, he entered on a holiday with a youthfulness of
enjoyment that made his companionship delightful; we felt that we saw
more of him in a week's holiday than in a month at home.

Some of these absences from home, however, had a depressing effect on
him; when he had been previously much overworked it seemed as though
the absence of the customary strain allowed him to fall into a peculiar
condition of miserable health.

Besides the holidays which I have mentioned, there were his visits
to water-cure establishments. In 1849, when very ill, suffering from
constant sickness, he was urged by a friend to try the water-cure,
and at last agreed to go to Dr. Gully's establishment at Malvern. His
letters to Mr. Fox show how much good the treatment did him; he seems
to have thought that he had found a cure for his troubles, but, like all
other remedies, it had only a transient effect on him. However, he found
it, at first, so good for him that when he came home he built himself a
douche-bath, and the butler learnt to be his bathman.

He paid many visits to Moor Park, Dr. Lane's water-cure establishment in
Surrey, not far from Aldershot. These visits were pleasant ones, and
he always looked back to them with pleasure. Dr. Lane has given his
recollections of my father in Dr. Richardson's 'Lecture on Charles
Darwin,' October 22, 1882, from which I quote:--

"In a public institution like mine, he was surrounded, of course, by
multifarious types of character, by persons of both sexes, mostly very
different from himself--commonplace people, in short, as the majority
are everywhere, but like to him at least in this, that they were
fellow-creatures and fellow-patients. And never was any one more genial,
more considerate, more friendly, more altogether charming than he
universally was."...He "never aimed, as too often happens with good
talkers, at monopolising the conversation. It was his pleasure rather
to give and take, and he was as good a listener as a speaker. He never
preached nor prosed, but his talk, whether grave or gay (and it was each
by turns), was full of life and salt--racy, bright, and animated."

Some idea of his relation to his family and his friends may be gathered
from what has gone before; it would be impossible to attempt a complete
account of these relationships, but a slightly fuller outline may not be
out of place. Of his married life I cannot speak, save in the
briefest manner. In his relationship towards my mother, his tender
and sympathetic nature was shown in its most beautiful aspect. In her
presence he found his happiness, and through her, his life,--which
might have been overshadowed by gloom,--became one of content and quiet
gladness.

The 'Expression of the Emotions' shows how closely he watched his
children; it was characteristic of him that (as I have heard him tell),
although he was so anxious to observe accurately the expression of a
crying child, his sympathy with the grief spoiled his observation. His
note-book, in which are recorded sayings of his young children, shows
his pleasure in them. He seemed to retain a sort of regretful memory
of the childhoods which had faded away, and thus he wrote in his
'Recollections':--"When you were very young it was my delight to play
with you all, and I think with a sigh that such days can never return."

I may quote, as showing the tenderness of his nature, some sentences
from an account of his little daughter Annie, written a few days after
her death:--

"Our poor child, Annie, was born in Gower Street, on March 2, 1841, and
expired at Malvern at mid-day on the 23rd of April, 1851.

"I write these few pages, as I think in after years, if we live,
the impressions now put down will recall more vividly her chief
characteristics. From whatever point I look back at her, the main
feature in her disposition which at once rises before me, is her
buoyant joyousness, tempered by two other characteristics, namely, her
sensitiveness, which might easily have been overlooked by a stranger,
and her strong affection. Her joyousness and animal spirits radiated
from her whole countenance, and rendered every movement elastic and full
of life and vigour. It was delightful and cheerful to behold her. Her
dear face now rises before me, as she used sometimes to come running
downstairs with a stolen pinch of snuff for me her whole form radiant
with the pleasure of giving pleasure. Even when playing with her
cousins, when her joyousness almost passed into boisterousness, a single
glance of my eye, not of displeasure (for I thank God I hardly ever cast
one on her), but of want of sympathy, would for some minutes alter her
whole countenance.

"The other point in her character, which made her joyousness and spirits
so delightful, was her strong affection, which was of a most clinging,
fondling nature. When quite a baby, this showed itself in never being
easy without touching her mother, when in bed with her; and quite
lately she would, when poorly, fondle for any length of time one of her
mother's arms. When very unwell, her mother lying down beside her seemed
to soothe her in a manner quite different from what it would have done
to any of our other children. So, again, she would at almost any time
spend half an hour in arranging my hair, 'making it,' as she called
it, 'beautiful,' or in smoothing, the poor dear darling, my collar or
cuffs--in short, in fondling me.

"Beside her joyousness thus tempered, she was in her manners remarkably
cordial, frank, open, straightforward, natural, and without any shade of
reserve. Her whole mind was pure and transparent. One felt one knew her
thoroughly and could trust her. I always thought, that come what might,
we should have had in our old age at least one loving soul which nothing
could have changed. All her movements were vigorous, active, and usually
graceful. When going round the Sand-walk with me, although I walked
fast, yet she often used to go before, pirouetting in the most elegant
way, her dear face bright all the time with the sweetest smiles.
Occasionally she had a pretty coquettish manner towards me, the memory
of which is charming. She often used exaggerated language, and when I
quizzed her by exaggerating what she had said, how clearly can I now see
the little toss of the head, and exclamation of 'Oh, papa what a shame
of you!' In the last short illness her conduct in simple truth was
angelic. She never once complained; never became fretful; was ever
considerate of others, and was thankful in the most gentle, pathetic
manner for everything done for her. When so exhausted that she could
hardly speak, she praised everything that was given her, and said some
tea 'was beautifully good.' When I gave her some water she said, 'I
quite thank you;' and these, I believe, were the last precious words
ever addressed by her dear lips to me.

"We have lost the joy of the household, and the solace of our old age.
She must have known how we loved her. Oh, that she could now know how
deeply, how tenderly, we do still and shall ever love her dear joyous
face! Blessings on her!

"April 30, 1851."

We his children all took especial pleasure in the games he played at
with us, but I do not think he romped much with us; I suppose his health
prevented any rough play. He used sometimes to tell us stories, which
were considered especially delightful, partly on account of their
rarity.

The way he brought us up is shown by a little story about my brother
Leonard, which my father was fond of telling. He came into the
drawing-room and found Leonard dancing about on the sofa, which was
forbidden, for the sake of the springs, and said, "Oh, Lenny, Lenny,
that's against all rules," and received for answer, "Then I think you'd
better go out of the room." I do not believe he ever spoke an angry
word to any of his children in his life; but I am certain that it never
entered our heads to disobey him. I well remember one occasion when my
father reproved me for a piece of carelessness; and I can still recall
the feeling of depression which came over me, and the care which he took
to disperse it by speaking to me soon afterwards with especial kindness.
He kept up his delightful, affectionate manner towards us all his life.
I sometimes wonder that he could do so, with such an undemonstrative
race as we are; but I hope he knew how much we delighted in his loving
words and manner. How often, when a man, I have wished when my father
was behind my chair, that he would pass his hand over my hair, as he
used to do when I was a boy. He allowed his grown-up children to laugh
with and at him, and was, generally speaking, on terms of perfect
equality with us.

He was always full of interest about each one's plans or successes. We
used to laugh at him, and say he would not believe in his sons, because,
for instance, he would be a little doubtful about their taking some bit
of work for which he did not feel sure that they had knowledge enough.
On the other hand, he was only too much inclined to take a favourable
view of our work. When I thought he had set too high a value on anything
that I had done, he used to be indignant and inclined to explode in mock
anger. His doubts were part of his humility concerning what was in any
way connected with himself; his too favourable view of our work was due
to his sympathetic nature, which made him lenient to every one.

He kept up towards his children his delightful manner of expressing his
thanks; and I never wrote a letter, or read a page aloud to him, without
receiving a few kind words of recognition. His love and goodness towards
his little grandson Bernard were great; and he often spoke of the
pleasure it was to him to see "his little face opposite to him" at
luncheon. He and Bernard used to compare their tastes; e.g., in liking
brown sugar better than white, etc.; the result being, "We always agree,
don't we?"

My sister writes:--

"My first remembrances of my father are of the delights of his playing
with us. He was passionately attached to his own children, although
he was not an indiscriminate child-lover. To all of us he was the most
delightful play-fellow, and the most perfect sympathiser. Indeed it is
impossible adequately to describe how delightful a relation his was to
his family, whether as children or in their later life.

"It is a proof of the terms on which we were, and also of how much he
was valued as a play-fellow, that one of his sons when about four years
old tried to bribe him with sixpence to come and play in working hours.
We all knew the sacredness of working-time, but that any one should
resist sixpence seemed an impossibility.

"He must have been the most patient and delightful of nurses. I remember
the haven of peace and comfort it seemed to me when I was unwell, to
be tucked up on the study sofa, idly considering the old geological map
hung on the wall. This must have been in his working hours, for I always
picture him sitting in the horsehair arm-chair by the corner of the
fire.

"Another mark of his unbounded patience was the way in which we were
suffered to make raids into the study when we had an absolute need of
sticking-plaster, string, pins, scissors, stamps, foot-rule, or hammer.
These and other such necessaries were always to be found in the study,
and it was the only place where this was a certainty. We used to feel it
wrong to go in during work-time; still, when the necessity was great we
did so. I remember his patient look when he said once, 'Don't you think
you could not come in again, I have been interrupted very often.' We
used to dread going in for sticking-plaster, because he disliked to
see that we had cut ourselves, both for our sakes and on account of his
acute sensitiveness to the sight of blood. I well remember lurking about
the passage till he was safe away, and then stealing in for the plaster.

"Life seems to me, as I look back upon it, to have been very regular in
those early days, and except relations (and a few intimate friends), I
do not think any one came to the house. After lessons, we were always
free to go where we would, and that was chiefly in the drawing-room
and about the garden, so that we were very much with both my father and
mother. We used to think it most delightful when he told us any stories
about the 'Beagle', or about early Shrewsbury days--little bits about
school-life and his boyish tastes. Sometimes too he read aloud to his
children such books as Scott's novels, and I remember a few little
lectures on the steam-engine.

"I was more or less ill during the five years between my thirteenth and
eighteenth years, and for a long time (years it seems to me) he used to
play a couple of games of backgammon with me every afternoon. He played
them with the greatest spirit, and I remember we used at one time to
keep account of the games, and as this record came out in favour of him,
we kept a list of the doublets thrown by each, as I was convinced that
he threw better than myself.

"His patience and sympathy were boundless during this weary illness, and
sometimes when most miserable I felt his sympathy to be almost too keen.
When at my worst, we went to my aunt's house at Hartfield, in Sussex,
and as soon as we had made the move safely he went on to Moor Park for
a fortnight's water-cure. I can recall now how on his return I could
hardly bear to have him in the room, the expression of tender sympathy
and emotion in his face was too agitating, coming fresh upon me after
his little absence.

"He cared for all our pursuits and interests, and lived our lives with
us in a way that very few fathers do. But I am certain that none of
us felt that this intimacy interfered the least with our respect or
obedience. Whatever he said was absolute truth and law to us. He always
put his whole mind into answering any of our questions. One trifling
instance makes me feel how he cared for what we cared for. He had no
special taste for cats, though he admired the pretty ways of a kitten.
But yet he knew and remembered the individualities of my many cats, and
would talk about the habits and characters of the more remarkable ones
years after they had died.

"Another characteristic of his treatment of his children was his respect
for their liberty, and for their personality. Even as quite a girl, I
remember rejoicing in this sense of freedom. Our father and mother would
not even wish to know what we were doing or thinking unless we wished
to tell. He always made us feel that we were each of us creatures whose
opinions and thoughts were valuable to him, so that whatever there was
best in us came out in the sunshine of his presence.

"I do not think his exaggerated sense of our good qualities,
intellectual or moral, made us conceited, as might perhaps have been
expected, but rather more humble and grateful to him. The reason being
no doubt that the influence of his character, of his sincerity and
greatness of nature, had a much deeper and more lasting effect than any
small exaltation which his praises or admiration may have caused to our
vanity."

As head of a household he was much loved and respected; he always spoke
to servants with politeness, using the expression, "would you be
so good," in asking for anything. He was hardly ever angry with his
servants; it shows how seldom this occurred, that when, as a small boy,
I overheard a servant being scolded, and my father speaking angrily,
it impressed me as an appalling circumstance, and I remember running up
stairs out of a general sense of awe. He did not trouble himself about
the management of the garden, cows, etc. He considered the horses so
little his concern, that he used to ask doubtfully whether he might
have a horse and cart to send to Keston for Drosera, or to the Westerham
nurseries for plants, or the like.

As a host my father had a peculiar charm: the presence of visitors
excited him, and made him appear to his best advantage. At Shrewsbury,
he used to say, it was his father's wish that the guests should be
attended to constantly, and in one of the letters to Fox he speaks
of the impossibility of writing a letter while the house was full
of company. I think he always felt uneasy at not doing more for the
entertainment of his guests, but the result was successful; and, to make
up for any loss, there was the gain that the guests felt perfectly free
to do as they liked. The most usual visitors were those who stayed
from Saturday till Monday; those who remained longer were generally
relatives, and were considered to be rather more my mother's affair than
his.

Besides these visitors, there were foreigners and other strangers,
who came down for luncheon and went away in the afternoon. He used
conscientiously to represent to them the enormous distance of Down from
London, and the labour it would be to come there, unconsciously taking
for granted that they would find the journey as toilsome as he did
himself. If, however, they were not deterred, he used to arrange their
journeys for them, telling them when to come, and practically when to
go. It was pleasant to see the way in which he shook hands with a guest
who was being welcomed for the first time; his hand used to shoot out
in a way that gave one the feeling that it was hastening to meet the
guest's hands. With old friends his hand came down with a hearty swing
into the other hand in a way I always had satisfaction in seeing. His
good-bye was chiefly characterised by the pleasant way in which he
thanked his guests, as he stood at the door, for having come to see him.

These luncheons were very successful entertainments, there was no drag
or flagging about them, my father was bright and excited throughout the
whole visit. Professor De Candolle has described a visit to Down, in
his admirable and sympathetic sketch of my father. ('Darwin considere au
point de vue des causes de son succes.'--Geneva, 1882.) He speaks of
his manner as resembling that of a "savant" of Oxford or Cambridge.
This does not strike me as quite a good comparison; in his ease and
naturalness there was more of the manner of some soldiers; a manner
arising from total absence of pretence or affectation. It was this
absence of pose, and the natural and simple way in which he began
talking to his guests, so as to get them on their own lines, which made
him so charming a host to a stranger. His happy choice of matter for
talk seemed to flow out of his sympathetic nature, and humble, vivid
interest in other people's work.

To some, I think, he caused actual pain by his modesty; I have seen the
late Francis Balfour quite discomposed by having knowledge ascribed to
himself on a point about which my father claimed to be utterly ignorant.

It is difficult to seize on the characteristics of my father's
conversation.

He had more dread than have most people of repeating his stories, and
continually said, "You must have heard me tell," or "I dare say I've
told you." One peculiarity he had, which gave a curious effect to his
conversation. The first few words of a sentence would often remind him
of some exception to, or some reason against, what he was going to say;
and this again brought up some other point, so that the sentence would
become a system of parenthesis within parenthesis, and it was often
impossible to understand the drift of what he was saying until he came
to the end of his sentence. He used to say of himself that he was not
quick enough to hold an argument with any one, and I think this was
true. Unless it was a subject on which he was just then at work, he
could not get the train of argument into working order quickly enough.
This is shown even in his letters; thus, in the case of two letters to
Prof. Semper about the effect of isolation, he did not recall the series
of facts he wanted until some days after the first letter had been sent
off.

When puzzled in talking, he had a peculiar stammer on the first word of
a sentence. I only recall this occurring with words beginning with w;
possibly he had a special difficulty with this letter, for I have heard
him say that as a boy he could not pronounce w, and that sixpence was
offered him if he could say "white wine," which he pronounced "rite
rine." Possibly he may have inherited this tendency from Erasmus
Darwin, who stammered. (My father related a Johnsonian answer of Erasmus
Darwin's: "Don't you find it very inconvenient stammering, Dr. Darwin?"
"No, sir, because I have time to think before I speak, and don't ask
impertinent questions.")

He sometimes combined his metaphors in a curious way, using such a
phrase as "holding on like life,"--a mixture of "holding on for his
life," and "holding on like grim death." It came from his eager way of
putting emphasis into what he was saying. This sometimes gave an air of
exaggeration where it was not intended; but it gave, too, a noble air
of strong and generous conviction; as, for instance, when he gave his
evidence before the Royal Commission on vivisection and came out with
his words about cruelty, "It deserves detestation and abhorrence."
When he felt strongly about any similar question, he could hardly trust
himself to speak, as he then easily became angry, a thing which he
disliked excessively. He was conscious that his anger had a tendency
to multiply itself in the utterance, and for this reason dreaded (for
example) having to scold a servant.

It was a great proof of the modesty of his style of talking, that, when,
for instance, a number of visitors came over from Sir John Lubbock's for
a Sunday afternoon call he never seemed to be preaching or lecturing,
although he had so much of the talk to himself. He was particularly
charming when "chaffing" any one, and in high spirits over it. His
manner at such times was light-hearted and boyish, and his refinement
of nature came out most strongly. So, when he was talking to a lady who
pleased and amused him, the combination of raillery and deference in his
manner was delightful to see.

When my father had several guests he managed them well, getting a talk
with each, or bringing two or three together round his chair. In
these conversations there was always a good deal of fun, and, speaking
generally, there was either a humorous turn in his talk, or a sunny
geniality which served instead. Perhaps my recollection of a pervading
element of humour is the more vivid, because the best talks were with
Mr. Huxley, in whom there is the aptness which is akin to humour, even
when humour itself is not there. My father enjoyed Mr. Huxley's humour
exceedingly, and would often say, "What splendid fun Huxley is!" I think
he probably had more scientific argument (of the nature of a fight) with
Lyell and Sir Joseph Hooker.

He used to say that it grieved him to find that for the friends of his
later life he had not the warm affection of his youth. Certainly in his
early letters from Cambridge he gives proofs of very strong friendship
for Herbert and Fox; but no one except himself would have said that
his affection for his friends was not, throughout life, of the warmest
possible kind. In serving a friend he would not spare himself, and
precious time and strength were willingly given. He undoubtedly had,
to an unusual degree, the power of attaching his friends to him. He had
many warm friendships, but to Sir Joseph Hooker he was bound by ties
of affection stronger than we often see among men. He wrote in his
'Recollections,' "I have known hardly any man more lovable than Hooker."

His relationship to the village people was a pleasant one; he treated
them, one and all, with courtesy, when he came in contact with them, and
took an interest in all relating to their welfare. Some time after he
came to live at Down he helped to found a Friendly Club, and served as
treasurer for thirty years. He took much trouble about the club, keeping
its accounts with minute and scrupulous exactness, and taking pleasure
in its prosperous condition. Every Whit-Monday the club used to march
round with band and banner, and paraded on the lawn in front of the
house. There he met them, and explained to them their financial position
in a little speech seasoned with a few well worn jokes. He was often
unwell enough to make even this little ceremony an exertion, but I think
he never failed to meet them.

He was also treasurer of the Coal Club, which gave him some work, and he
acted for some years as a County Magistrate.

With regard to my father's interest in the affairs of the village, Mr.
Brodie Innes has been so good as to give me his recollections:--

"On my becoming Vicar of Down in 1846, we became friends, and so
continued till his death. His conduct towards me and my family was one
of unvarying kindness, and we repaid it by warm affection.

"In all parish matters he was an active assistant; in matters
connected with the schools, charities, and other business, his liberal
contribution was ever ready, and in the differences which at times
occurred in that, as in other parishes, I was always sure of his
support. He held that where there was really no important objection,
his assistance should be given to the clergyman, who ought to know the
circumstances best, and was chiefly responsible."

His intercourse with strangers was marked with scrupulous and rather
formal politeness, but in fact he had few opportunities of meeting
strangers.

Dr. Lane has described (Lecture by Dr. B.W. Richardson, in St. George's
Hall, October 22, 1882.) how, on the rare occasion of my father
attending a lecture (Dr. Sanderson's) at the Royal Institution, "the
whole assembly...rose to their feet to welcome him," while he seemed
"scarcely conscious that such an outburst of applause could possibly
be intended for himself." The quiet life he led at Down made him feel
confused in a large society; for instance, at the Royal Society's
soirees he felt oppressed by the numbers. The feeling that he ought
to know people, and the difficulty he had in remembering faces in his
latter years, also added to his discomfort on such occasions. He did not
realise that he would be recognised from his photographs, and I remember
his being uneasy at being obviously recognised by a stranger at the
Crystal Palace Aquarium.

I must say something of his manner of working: one characteristic of it
was his respect for time; he never forgot how precious it was. This
was shown, for instance, in the way in which he tried to curtail his
holidays; also, and more clearly, with respect to shorter periods. He
would often say, that saving the minutes was the way to get work done;
he showed his love of saving the minutes in the difference he felt
between a quarter of an hour and ten minutes' work; he never wasted a
few spare minutes from thinking that it was not worth while to set to
work. I was often struck by his way of working up to the very limit of
his strength, so that he suddenly stopped in dictating, with the words,
"I believe I mustn't do any more." The same eager desire not to lose
time was seen in his quick movements when at work. I particularly
remember noticing this when he was making an experiment on the roots of
beans, which required some care in manipulation; fastening the little
bits of card upon the roots was done carefully and necessarily slowly,
but the intermediate movements were all quick; taking a fresh bean,
seeing that the root was healthy, impaling it on a pin, fixing it on
a cork, and seeing that it was vertical, etc; all these processes were
performed with a kind of restrained eagerness. He always gave one the
impression of working with pleasure, and not with any drag. I have an
image, too, of him as he recorded the result of some experiment, looking
eagerly at each root, etc., and then writing with equal eagerness. I
remember the quick movement of his head up and down as he looked from
the object to the notes.

He saved a great deal of time through not having to do things twice.
Although he would patiently go on repeating experiments where there
was any good to be gained, he could not endure having to repeat an
experiment which ought, if complete care had been taken, to have
succeeded the first time--and this gave him a continual anxiety that the
experiment should not be wasted; he felt the experiment to be sacred,
however slight a one it was. He wished to learn as much as possible
from an experiment, so that he did not confine himself to observing
the single point to which the experiment was directed, and his power of
seeing a number of other things was wonderful. I do not think he cared
for preliminary or rough observation intended to serve as guides and
to be repeated. Any experiment done was to be of some use, and in this
connection I remember how strongly he urged the necessity of keeping the
notes of experiments which failed, and to this rule he always adhered.

In the literary part of his work he had the same horror of losing time,
and the same zeal in what he was doing at the moment, and this made him
careful not to be obliged unnecessarily to read anything a second time.

His natural tendency was to use simple methods and few instruments. The
use of the compound microscope has much increased since his youth,
and this at the expense of the simple one. It strikes us nowadays as
extraordinary that he should have had no compound microscope when he
went his "Beagle" voyage; but in this he followed the advice of Robt.
Brown, who was an authority in such matters. He always had a great
liking for the simple microscope, and maintained that nowadays it was
too much neglected, and that one ought always to see as much as possible
with the simple before taking to the compound microscope. In one of his
letters he speaks on this point, and remarks that he always suspects the
work of a man who never uses the simple microscope.

His dissecting table was a thick board, let into a window of the study;
it was lower than an ordinary table, so that he could not have worked at
it standing; but this, from wishing to save his strength, he would not
have done in any case. He sat at his dissecting-table on a curious
low stool which had belonged to his father, with a seat revolving on a
vertical spindle, and mounted on large castors, so that he could turn
easily from side to side. His ordinary tools, etc., were lying about on
the table, but besides these a number of odds and ends were kept in a
round table full of radiating drawers, and turning on a vertical axis,
which stood close by his left side, as he sat at his microscope-table.
The drawers were labelled, "best tools," "rough tools," "specimens,"
"preparations for specimens," etc. The most marked peculiarity of the
contents of these drawers was the care with which little scraps and
almost useless things were preserved; he held the well-known belief,
that if you threw a thing away you were sure to want it directly--and so
things accumulated.

If any one had looked at his tools, etc., lying on the table, he would
have been struck by an air of simpleness, make-shift, and oddness.

At his right hand were shelves, with a number of other odds and ends,
glasses, saucers, tin biscuit boxes for germinating seeds, zinc labels,
saucers full of sand, etc., etc. Considering how tidy and methodical
he was in essential things, it is curious that he bore with so many
make-shifts: for instance, instead of having a box made of a desired
shape, and stained black inside, he would hunt up something like what he
wanted and get it darkened inside with shoe-blacking; he did not care
to have glass covers made for tumblers in which he germinated seeds,
but used broken bits of irregular shape, with perhaps a narrow angle
sticking uselessly out on one side. But so much of his experimenting was
of a simple kind, that he had no need for any elaboration, and I think
his habit in this respect was in great measure due to his desire to
husband his strength, and not waste it on inessential things.

His way of marking objects may here be mentioned. If he had a number of
things to distinguish, such as leaves, flowers, etc., he tied threads of
different colours round them. In particular he used this method when
he had only two classes of objects to distinguish; thus in the case of
crossed and self-fertilised flowers, one set would be marked with
black and one with white thread, tied round the stalk of the flower. I
remember well the look of two sets of capsules, gathered and waiting to
be weighed, counted, etc., with pieces of black and of white thread to
distinguish the trays in which they lay. When he had to compare two sets
of seedlings, sowed in the same pot, he separated them by a partition of
zinc-plate; and the zinc label, which gave the necessary details about
the experiment, was always placed on a certain side, so that it became
instinctive with him to know without reading the label which were the
"crossed" and which were the "self-fertilised."

His love of each particular experiment, and his eager zeal not to lose
the fruit of it, came out markedly in these crossing experiments--in
the elaborate care he took not to make any confusion in putting capsules
into wrong trays, etc., etc. I can recall his appearance as he counted
seeds under the simple microscope with an alertness not usually
characterising such mechanical work as counting. I think he personified
each seed as a small demon trying to elude him by getting into the
wrong heap, or jumping away altogether; and this gave to the work the
excitement of a game. He had great faith in instruments, and I do not
think it naturally occurred to him to doubt the accuracy of a scale or
measuring glass, etc. He was astonished when we found that one of
his micrometers differed from the other. He did not require any great
accuracy in most of his measurements, and had not good scales; he had an
old three-foot rule, which was the common property of the household,
and was constantly being borrowed, because it was the only one which
was certain to be in its place--unless, indeed, the last borrower had
forgotten to put it back. For measuring the height of plants he had a
seven-foot deal rod, graduated by the village carpenter. Latterly he
took to using paper scales graduated to millimeters. For small
objects he used a pair of compasses and an ivory protractor. It
was characteristic of him that he took scrupulous pains in making
measurements with his somewhat rough scales. A trifling example of his
faith in authority is that he took his "inch in terms of millimeters"
from an old book, in which it turned out to be inaccurately given.
He had a chemical balance which dated from the days when he worked at
chemistry with his brother Erasmus. Measurements of capacity were made
with an apothecary's measuring glass: I remember well its rough look
and bad graduation. With this, too, I remember the great care he took
in getting the fluid-line on to the graduation. I do not mean by this
account of his instruments that any of his experiments suffered from
want of accuracy in measurement, I give them as examples of his simple
methods and faith in others--faith at least in instrument-makers, whose
whole trade was a mystery to him.

A few of his mental characteristics, bearing especially on his mode of
working, occur to me. There was one quality of mind which seemed to be
of special and extreme advantage in leading him to make discoveries.
It was the power of never letting exceptions pass unnoticed. Everybody
notices a fact as an exception when it is striking or frequent, but he
had a special instinct for arresting an exception. A point apparently
slight and unconnected with his present work is passed over by many a
man almost unconsciously with some half-considered explanation, which
is in fact no explanation. It was just these things that he seized on to
make a start from. In a certain sense there is nothing special in this
procedure, many discoveries being made by means of it. I only mention
it because, as I watched him at work, the value of this power to an
experimenter was so strongly impressed upon me.

Another quality which was shown in his experimental works was his power
of sticking to a subject; he used almost to apologise for his patience,
saying that he could not bear to be beaten, as if this were rather a
sign of weakness on his part. He often quoted the saying, "It's dogged
as does it;" and I think doggedness expresses his frame of mind almost
better than perseverance. Perseverance seems hardly to express his
almost fierce desire to force the truth to reveal itself. He often said
that it was important that a man should know the right point at which to
give up an inquiry. And I think it was his tendency to pass this point
that inclined him to apologise for his perseverance, and gave the air of
doggedness to his work.

He often said that no one could be a good observer unless he was an
active theoriser. This brings me back to what I said about his instinct
for arresting exceptions: it was as though he were charged with
theorising power ready to flow into any channel on the slightest
disturbance, so that no fact, however small, could avoid releasing a
stream of theory, and thus the fact became magnified into importance. In
this way it naturally happened that many untenable theories occurred
to him; but fortunately his richness of imagination was equalled by his
power of judging and condemning the thoughts that occurred to him. He
was just to his theories, and did not condemn them unheard; and so it
happened that he was willing to test what would seem to most people
not at all worth testing. These rather wild trials he called "fool's
experiments," and enjoyed extremely. As an example I may mention that
finding the cotyledons of Biophytum to be highly sensitive to vibrations
of the table, he fancied that they might perceive the vibrations of
sound, and therefore made me play my bassoon close to a plant. (This is
not so much an example of superabundant theorising from a small cause,
but only of his wish to test the most improbable ideas.)

The love of experiment was very strong in him, and I can remember the
way he would say, "I shan't be easy till I have tried it," as if an
outside force were driving him. He enjoyed experimenting much more than
work which only entailed reasoning, and when he was engaged on one of
his books which required argument and the marshalling of facts, he felt
experimental work to be a rest or holiday. Thus, while working upon
the 'Variations of Animals and Plants,' in 1860-61, he made out the
fertilisation of Orchids, and thought himself idle for giving so much
time to them. It is interesting to think that so important a piece of
research should have been undertaken and largely worked out as a pastime
in place of more serious work. The letters to Hooker of this period
contain expressions such as, "God forgive me for being so idle; I am
quite sillily interested in this work." The intense pleasure he took
in understanding the adaptations for fertilisation is strongly shown
in these letters. He speaks in one of his letters of his intention of
working at Drosera as a rest from the 'Descent of Man.' He has described
in his 'Recollections' the strong satisfaction he felt in solving the
problem of heterostylism. And I have heard him mention that the Geology
of South America gave him almost more pleasure than anything else. It
was perhaps this delight in work requiring keen observation that
made him value praise given to his observing powers almost more than
appreciation of his other qualities.

For books he had no respect, but merely considered them as tools to be
worked with. Thus he did not bind them, and even when a paper book fell
to pieces from use, as happened to Muller's 'Befruchtung,' he preserved
it from complete dissolution by putting a metal clip over its back.
In the same way he would cut a heavy book in half, to make it more
convenient to hold. He used to boast that he made Lyell publish the
second edition of one of his books in two volumes instead of one, by
telling him how he had been obliged to cut it in half. Pamphlets were
often treated even more severely than books, for he would tear out, for
the sake of saving room, all the pages except the one that interested
him. The consequence of all this was, that his library was not
ornamental, but was striking from being so evidently a working
collection of books.

He was methodical in his manner of reading books and pamphlets bearing
on his own work. He had one shelf on which were piled up the books
he had not yet read, and another to which they were transferred after
having been read, and before being catalogued. He would often groan over
his unread books, because there were so many which he knew he should
never read. Many a book was at once transferred to the other heap,
either marked with a cypher at the end, to show that it contained no
marked passages, or inscribed, perhaps, "not read," or "only skimmed."
The books accumulated in the "read" heap until the shelves overflowed,
and then, with much lamenting, a day was given up to the cataloguing. He
disliked this work, and as the necessity of undertaking the work became
imperative, would often say, in a voice of despair, "We really must do
these books soon."

In each book, as he read it, he marked passages bearing on his work. In
reading a book or pamphlet, etc., he made pencil-lines at the side of
the page, often adding short remarks, and at the end made a list of
the pages marked. When it was to be catalogued and put away, the marked
pages were looked at, and so a rough abstract of the book was made.
This abstract would perhaps be written under three or four headings on
different sheets, the facts being sorted out and added to the previously
collected facts in different subjects. He had other sets of abstracts
arranged, not according to subject, but according to periodical. When
collecting facts on a large scale, in earlier years, he used to
read through, and make abstracts, in this way, of whole series of
periodicals.

In some of his early letters he speaks of filling several note-books
with facts for his book on species; but it was certainly early that
he adopted his plan of using portfolios as described in the
'Recollections.' (The racks on which the portfolios were placed are
shown in the illustration, "The Study at Down," in the recess at the
right-hand side of the fire-place.) My father and M. de Candolle were
mutually pleased to discover that they had adopted the same plan of
classifying facts. De Candolle describes the method in his 'Phytologie,'
and in his sketch of my father mentions the satisfaction he felt in
seeing it in action at Down.

Besides these portfolios, of which there are some dozens full of notes,
there are large bundles of MS. marked "used" and put away. He felt the
value of his notes, and had a horror of their destruction by fire. I
remember, when some alarm of fire had happened, his begging me to be
especially careful, adding very earnestly, that the rest of his life
would be miserable if his notes and books were to be destroyed.

He shows the same feeling in writing about the loss of a manuscript,
the purport of his words being, "I have a copy, or the loss would have
killed me." In writing a book he would spend much time and labour
in making a skeleton or plan of the whole, and in enlarging and
sub-classing each heading, as described in his 'Recollections.' I think
this careful arrangement of the plan was not at all essential to the
building up of his argument, but for its presentment, and for the
arrangement of his facts. In his 'Life of Erasmus Darwin,' as it was
first printed in slips, the growth of the book from a skeleton was
plainly visible. The arrangement was altered afterwards, because it
was too formal and categorical, and seemed to give the character of his
grandfather rather by means of a list of qualities than as a complete
picture.

It was only within the last few years that he adopted a plan of writing
which he was convinced suited him best, and which is described in the
'Recollections;' namely, writing a rough copy straight off without the
slightest attention to style. It was characteristic of him that he felt
unable to write with sufficient want of care if he used his best paper,
and thus it was that he wrote on the backs of old proofs or manuscript.
The rough copy was then reconsidered, and a fair copy was made. For this
purpose he had foolscap paper ruled at wide intervals, the lines
being needed to prevent him writing so closely that correction became
difficult. The fair copy was then corrected, and was recopied before
being sent to the printers. The copying was done by Mr. E. Norman, who
began this work many years ago when village schoolmaster at Down. My
father became so used to Mr. Norman's hand-writing, that he could
not correct manuscript, even when clearly written out by one of
his children, until it had been recopied by Mr. Norman. The MS., on
returning from Mr. Norman was once more corrected, and then sent off to
the printers. Then came the work of revising and correcting the proofs,
which my father found especially wearisome.

It was at this stage that he first seriously considered the style of
what he had written. When this was going on he usually started some
other piece of work as a relief. The correction of slips consisted in
fact of two processes, for the corrections were first written in pencil,
and then re-considered and written in ink.

When the book was passing through the "slip" stage he was glad to have
corrections and suggestions from others. Thus my mother looked over
the proofs of the 'Origin.' In some of the later works my sister, Mrs.
Litchfield, did much of the correction. After my sister's marriage
perhaps most of the work fell to my share.

My sister, Mrs. Litchfield, writes:--

"This work was very interesting in itself, and it was inexpressibly
exhilarating to work for him. He was always so ready to be convinced
that any suggested alteration was an improvement, and so full of
gratitude for the trouble taken. I do not think that he ever used to
forget to tell me what improvement he thought that I had made, and he
used almost to excuse himself if he did not agree with any correction. I
think I felt the singular modesty and graciousness of his nature through
thus working for him in a way I never should otherwise have done.

"He did not write with ease, and was apt to invert his sentences both in
writing and speaking, putting the qualifying clause before it was clear
what it was to qualify. He corrected a great deal, and was eager to
express himself as well as he possibly could."

Perhaps the commonest corrections needed were of obscurities due to the
omission of a necessary link in the reasoning, something which he had
evidently omitted through familiarity with the subject. Not that there
was any fault in the sequence of the thoughts, but that from familiarity
with his argument he did not notice when the words failed to reproduce
his thought. He also frequently put too much matter into one sentence,
so that it had to be cut up into two.

On the whole, I think the pains which my father took over the literary
part of the work was very remarkable. He often laughed or grumbled at
himself for the difficulty which he found in writing English, saying,
for instance, that if a bad arrangement of a sentence was possible, he
should be sure to adopt it. He once got much amusement and satisfaction
out of the difficulty which one of the family found in writing a short
circular. He had the pleasure of correcting and laughing at obscurities,
involved sentences, and other defects, and thus took his revenge for
all the criticism he had himself to bear with. He used to quote with
astonishment Miss Martineau's advice to young authors, to write straight
off and send the MS. to the printer without correction. But in some
cases he acted in a somewhat similar manner. When a sentence got
hopelessly involved, he would ask himself, "now what DO you want
to say?" and his answer written down, would often disentangle the
confusion.

His style has been much praised; on the other hand, at least one good
judge has remarked to me that it is not a good style. It is, above all
things, direct and clear; and it is characteristic of himself in its
simplicity, bordering on naivete, and in its absence of pretence. He had
the strongest disbelief in the common idea that a classical scholar must
write good English; indeed, he thought that the contrary was the case.
In writing, he sometimes showed the same tendency to strong expressions
as he did in conversation. Thus in the 'Origin,' page 440, there is
a description of a larval cirripede, "with six pairs of beautifully
constructed natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and
extremely complex antennae." We used to laugh at him for this sentence,
which we compared to an advertisement. This tendency to give himself
up to the enthusiastic turn of his thought, without fear of being
ludicrous, appears elsewhere in his writings.

His courteous and conciliatory tone towards his reader is remarkable,
and it must be partly this quality which revealed his personal sweetness
of character to so many who had never seen him. I have always felt it
to be a curious fact, that he who had altered the face of Biological
Science, and is in this respect the chief of the moderns, should have
written and worked in so essentially a non-modern spirit and manner. In
reading his books one is reminded of the older naturalists rather than
of the modern school of writers. He was a Naturalist in the old sense of
the word, that is, a man who works at many branches of the science, not
merely a specialist in one. Thus it is, that, though he founded whole
new divisions of special subjects--such as the fertilisation of flowers,
insectivorous plants, dimorphism, etc.--yet even in treating these very
subjects he does not strike the reader as a specialist. The reader feels
like a friend who is being talked to by a courteous gentleman, not like
a pupil being lectured by a professor. The tone of such a book as the
'Origin' is charming, and almost pathetic; it is the tone of a man who,
convinced of the truth of his own views, hardly expects to convince
others; it is just the reverse of the style of a fanatic, who wants to
force people to believe. The reader is never scorned for any amount of
doubt which he may be imagined to feel, and his scepticism is
treated with patient respect. A sceptical reader, or perhaps even
an unreasonable reader, seems to have been generally present to his
thoughts. It was in consequence of this feeling, perhaps, that he took
much trouble over points which he imagined would strike the reader, or
save him trouble, and so tempt him to read.

For the same reason he took much interest in the illustrations of
his books, and I think rated rather too highly their value. The
illustrations for his earlier books were drawn by professional artists.
This was the case in 'Animals and Plants,' the 'Descent of Man,' and
the 'Expression of the Emotions.' On the other hand, 'Climbing Plants,'
'Insectivorous Plants,' the 'Movements of Plants,' and 'Forms
of Flowers,' were, to a large extent, illustrated by some of his
children--my brother George having drawn by far the most. It was
delightful to draw for him, as he was enthusiastic in his praise of very
moderate performances. I remember well his charming manner of receiving
the drawings of one of his daughters-in-law, and how he would finish his
words of praise by saying, "Tell A--, Michael Angelo is nothing to
it." Though he praised so generously, he always looked closely at the
drawing, and easily detected mistakes or carelessness.

He had a horror of being lengthy, and seems to have been really much
annoyed and distressed when he found how the 'Variations of Animals and
Plants' was growing under his hands. I remember his cordially agreeing
with 'Tristram Shandy's' words, "Let no man say, 'Come, I'll write a
duodecimo.'"

His consideration for other authors was as marked a characteristic as
his tone towards his reader. He speaks of all other authors as persons
deserving of respect. In cases where, as in the case of --'s experiments
on Drosera, he thought lightly of the author, he speaks of him in such a
way that no one would suspect it. In other cases he treats the confused
writings of ignorant persons as though the fault lay with himself for
not appreciating or understanding them. Besides this general tone of
respect, he had a pleasant way of expressing his opinion on the value of
a quoted work, or his obligation for a piece of private information.

His respectful feeling was not only morally beautiful, but was I
think of practical use in making him ready to consider the ideas and
observations of all manner of people. He used almost to apologise for
this, and would say that he was at first inclined to rate everything too
highly.

It was a great merit in his mind that, in spite of having so strong a
respectful feeling towards what he read, he had the keenest of instincts
as to whether a man was trustworthy or not. He seemed to form a very
definite opinion as to the accuracy of the men whose books he read; and
made use of this judgment in his choice of facts for use in argument
or as illustrations. I gained the impression that he felt this power of
judging of a man's trustworthiness to be of much value.

He had a keen feeling of the sense of honour that ought to reign among
authors, and had a horror of any kind of laxness in quoting. He had
a contempt for the love of honour and glory, and in his letters often
blames himself for the pleasure he took in the success of his books,
as though he were departing from his ideal--a love of truth and
carelessness about fame. Often, when writing to Sir J. Hooker what he
calls a boasting letter, he laughs at himself for his conceit and want
of modesty. There is a wonderfully interesting letter which he wrote
to my mother bequeathing to her, in case of his death, the care of
publishing the manuscript of his first essay on evolution. This letter
seems to me full of the intense desire that his theory should succeed
as a contribution to knowledge, and apart from any desire for personal
fame. He certainly had the healthy desire for success which a man of
strong feelings ought to have. But at the time of the publication of
the 'Origin' it is evident that he was overwhelmingly satisfied with the
adherence of such men as Lyell, Hooker, Huxley, and Asa Gray, and did
not dream of or desire any such wide and general fame as he attained to.

Connected with his contempt for the undue love of fame, was an equally
strong dislike of all questions of priority. The letters to Lyell, at
the time of the 'Origin,' show the anger he felt with himself for not
being able to repress a feeling of disappointment at what he thought
was Mr. Wallace's forestalling of all his years of work. His sense of
literary honour comes out strongly in these letters; and his feeling
about priority is again shown in the admiration expressed in his
'Recollections' of Mr. Wallace's self-annihilation.

His feeling about reclamations, including answers to attacks and all
kinds of discussions, was strong. It is simply expressed in a letter to
Falconer (1863?), "If I ever felt angry towards you, for whom I have a
sincere friendship, I should begin to suspect that I was a little mad. I
was very sorry about your reclamation, as I think it is in every case
a mistake and should be left to others. Whether I should so act myself
under provocation is a different question." It was a feeling partly
dictated by instinctive delicacy, and partly by a strong sense of the
waste of time, energy, and temper thus caused. He said that he owed his
determination not to get into discussions (He departed from his rule in
his "Note on the Habits of the Pampas Woodpecker, Colaptes campestris,"
'Proc. Zool. Soc.,' 1870, page 705: also in a letter published in the
'Athenaeum' (1863, page 554), in which case he afterwards regretted
that he had not remained silent. His replies to criticisms, in the later
editions of the 'Origin,' can hardly be classed as infractions of his
rule.) to the advice of Lyell,--advice which he transmitted to those
among his friends who were given to paper warfare.

If the character of my father's working life is to be understood, the
conditions of ill-health, under which he worked, must be constantly
borne in mind. He bore his illness with such uncomplaining patience,
that even his children can hardly, I believe, realise the extent of his
habitual suffering. In their case the difficulty is heightened by the
fact that, from the days of their earliest recollections, they saw him
in constant ill-health,--and saw him, in spite of it, full of pleasure
in what pleased them. Thus, in later life, their perception of what he
endured had to be disentangled from the impression produced in childhood
by constant genial kindness under conditions of unrecognised difficulty.
No one indeed, except my mother, knows the full amount of suffering
he endured, or the full amount of his wonderful patience. For all the
latter years of his life she never left him for a night; and her days
were so planned that all his resting hours might be shared with her. She
shielded him from every avoidable annoyance, and omitted nothing that
might save him trouble, or prevent him becoming overtired, or that might
alleviate the many discomforts of his ill-health. I hesitate to speak
thus freely of a thing so sacred as the life-long devotion which
prompted all this constant and tender care. But it is, I repeat, a
principal feature of his life, that for nearly forty years he never knew
one day of the health of ordinary men, and that thus his life was one
long struggle against the weariness and strain of sickness. And this
cannot be told without speaking of the one condition which enabled him
to bear the strain and fight out the struggle to the end.


LETTERS.

The earliest letters to which I have access are those written by my
father when an undergraduate at Cambridge.

The history of his life, as told in his correspondence, must therefore
begin with this period.




CHAPTER 1.IV. -- CAMBRIDGE LIFE.

[My father's Cambridge life comprises the time between the Lent Term,
1828, when he came up as a Freshman, and the end of the May Term, 1831,
when he took his degree and left the University.]

It appears from the College books, that my father "admissus est
pensionarius minor sub Magistro Shaw" on October 15, 1827. He did not
come into residence till the Lent Term, 1828, so that, although he
passed his examination in due season, he was unable to take his degree
at the usual time,--the beginning of the Lent Term, 1831. In such a case
a man usually took his degree before Ash-Wednesday, when he was called
"Baccalaureus ad Diem Cinerum," and ranked with the B.A.'s of the
year. My father's name, however, occurs in the list of Bachelors
"ad Baptistam," or those admitted between Ash-Wednesday and St. John
Baptist's Day (June 24th); ("On Tuesday last Charles Darwin, of Christ's
College, was admitted B.A."--"Cambridge Chronicle", Friday, April 29,
1831.) he therefore took rank among the Bachelors of 1832.

He "kept" for a term or two in lodgings, over Bacon the tobacconist's;
not, however, over the shop in the Market Place, now so well known to
Cambridge men, but in Sidney Street. For the rest of his time he had
pleasant rooms on the south side of the first court of Christ's. (The
rooms are on the first floor, on the west side of the middle staircase.
A medallion (given by my brother) has recently been let into the wall of
the sitting-room.)

What determined the choice of this college for his brother Erasmus
and himself I have no means of knowing. Erasmus the elder, their
grandfather, had been at St. John's, and this college might have been
reasonably selected for them, being connected with Shrewsbury School.
But the life of an under-graduate at St. John's seems, in those days, to
have been a troubled one, if I may judge from the fact that a relative
of mine migrated thence to Christ's to escape the harassing discipline
of the place. A story told by Mr. Herbert illustrates the same state of
things:--

"In the beginning of the October Term of 1830, an incident occurred
which was attended with somewhat disagreeable, though ludicrous
consequences to myself. Darwin asked me to take a long walk with him in
the Fens, to search for some natural objects he was desirous of having.
After a very long, fatiguing day's work, we dined together, late in the
evening, at his rooms in Christ's College; and as soon as our dinner was
over we threw ourselves into easy chairs and fell sound asleep. I was
first to awake, about three in the morning, when, having looked at my
watch, and knowing the strict rule of St. John's, which required men in
statu pupillari to come into college before midnight, I rushed homeward
at the utmost speed, in fear of the consequences, but hoping that the
Dean would accept the excuse as sufficient when I told him the
real facts. He, however, was inexorable, and refused to receive my
explanations, or any evidence I could bring; and although during
my undergraduateship I had never been reported for coming late into
College, now, when I was a hard-working B.A., and had five or six
pupils, he sentenced me to confinement to the College walls for the
rest of the term. Darwin's indignation knew no bounds, and the stupid
injustice and tyranny of the Dean raised not only a perfect ferment
among my friends, but was the subject of expostulation from some of the
leading members of the University."

My father seems to have found no difficulty in living at peace with
all men in and out of office at Lady Margaret's other foundation. The
impression of a contemporary of my father's is that Christ's in their
day was a pleasant, fairly quiet college, with some tendency towards
"horsiness"; many of the men made a custom of going to Newmarket during
the races, though betting was not a regular practice. In this they were
by no means discouraged by the Senior Tutor, Mr. Shaw, who was himself
generally to be seen on the Heath on these occasions. There was a
somewhat high proportion of Fellow-Commoners,--eight or nine, to sixty
or seventy Pensioners, and this would indicate that it was not an
unpleasant college for men with money to spend and with no great love of
strict discipline.

The way in which the service was conducted in chapel shows that the
Dean, at least, was not over zealous. I have heard my father tell how
at evening chapel the Dean used to read alternate verses of the Psalms,
without making even a pretence of waiting for the congregation to take
their share. And when the Lesson was a lengthy one, he would rise and
go on with the Canticles after the scholar had read fifteen or twenty
verses.

It is curious that my father often spoke of his Cambridge life as if it
had been so much time wasted, forgetting that, although the set studies
of the place were barren enough for him, he yet gained in the highest
degree the best advantages of a University life--the contact with men
and an opportunity for his mind to grow vigorously. It is true that he
valued at its highest the advantages which he gained from associating
with Professor Henslow and some others, but he seemed to consider this
as a chance outcome of his life at Cambridge, not an advantage for which
Alma Mater could claim any credit. One of my father's Cambridge friends
was the late Mr. J.M. Herbert, County Court Judge for South Wales, from
whom I was fortunate enough to obtain some notes which help us to gain
an idea of how my father impressed his contemporaries. Mr. Herbert
writes: "I think it was in the spring of 1828 that I first met Darwin,
either at my cousin Whitley's rooms in St. John's, or at the rooms of
some other of his old Shrewsbury schoolfellows, with many of whom I was
on terms of great intimacy. But it certainly was in the summer of that
year that our acquaintance ripened into intimacy, when we happened to
be together at Barmouth, for the Long Vacation, reading with private
tutors,--he with Batterton of St. John's, his Classical and Mathematical
Tutor, and I with Yate of St. John's."

The intercourse between them practically ceased in 1831, when my father
said goodbye to Herbert at Cambridge, on starting on his "Beagle"
voyage. I once met Mr. Herbert, then almost an old man, and I was much
struck by the evident warmth and freshness of the affection with which
he remembered my father. The notes from which I quote end with this
warm-hearted eulogium: "It would be idle for me to speak of his vast
intellectual powers...but I cannot end this cursory and rambling sketch
without testifying, and I doubt not all his surviving college friends
would concur with me, that he was the most genial, warm-hearted,
generous, and affectionate of friends; that his sympathies were with all
that was good and true; and that he had a cordial hatred for everything
false, or vile, or cruel, or mean, or dishonourable. He was not only
great, but pre-eminently good, and just, and loveable."

Two anecdotes told by Mr. Herbert show that my father's feeling for
suffering, whether of man or beast, was as strong in him as a young man
as it was in later years: "Before he left Cambridge he told me that he
had made up his mind not to shoot any more; that he had had two days'
shooting at his friend's, Mr. Owen of Woodhouse; and that on the second
day, when going over some of the ground they had beaten on the day
before, he picked up a bird not quite dead, but lingering from a shot it
had received on the previous day; and that it had made and left such a
painful impression on his mind, that he could not reconcile it to his
conscience to continue to derive pleasure from a sport which inflicted
such cruel suffering."

To realise the strength of the feeling that led to this resolve, we must
remember how passionate was his love of sport. We must recall the
boy shooting his first snipe ('Recollections.'), and trembling with
excitement so that he could hardly reload his gun. Or think of such a
sentence as, "Upon my soul, it is only about a fortnight to the 'First,'
then if there is a bliss on earth that is it." (Letter from C. Darwin to
W.D. Fox.)

Another anecdote told by Mr. Herbert illustrates again his tenderness of
heart:--

"When at Barmouth he and I went to an exhibition of 'learned dogs.' In
the middle of the entertainment one of the dogs failed in performing the
trick his master told him to do. On the man reproving him, the dog put
on a most piteous expression, as if in fear of the whip. Darwin seeing
it, asked me to leave with him, saying, 'Come along, I can't stand this
any longer; how those poor dogs must have been licked.'"

It is curious that the same feeling recurred to my father more
than fifty years afterwards, on seeing some performing dogs at the
Westminster Aquarium; on this occasion he was reassured by the manager
telling him that the dogs were taught more by reward than by punishment.
Mr. Herbert goes on:--"It stirred one's inmost depth of feeling to hear
him descant upon, and groan over, the horrors of the slave-trade, or the
cruelties to which the suffering Poles were subjected at Warsaw...These,
and other like proofs have left on my mind the conviction that a more
humane or tender-hearted man never lived."

His old college friends agree in speaking with affectionate warmth of
his pleasant, genial temper as a young man. From what they have been
able to tell me, I gain the impression of a young man overflowing with
animal spirits--leading a varied healthy life--not over-industrious in
the set of studies of the place, but full of other pursuits, which were
followed with a rejoicing enthusiasm. Entomology, riding, shooting in
the fens, suppers and card-playing, music at King's Chapel, engravings
at the Fitzwilliam Museum, walks with Professor Henslow--all combined
to fill up a happy life. He seems to have infected others with his
enthusiasm. Mr. Herbert relates how, during the same Barmouth summer,
he was pressed into the service of "the science"--as my father called
collecting beetles. They took their daily walks together among the hills
behind Barmouth, or boated in the Mawddach estuary, or sailed to
Sarn Badrig to land there at low water, or went fly-fishing in the
Cors-y-gedol lakes. "On these occasions Darwin entomologized most
industriously, picking up creatures as he walked along, and bagging
everything which seemed worthy of being pursued, or of further
examination. And very soon he armed me with a bottle of alcohol, in
which I had to drop any beetle which struck me as not of a common kind.
I performed this duty with some diligence in my constitutional walks;
but alas! my powers of discrimination seldom enabled me to secure a
prize--the usual result, on his examining the contents of my bottle,
being an exclamation, 'Well, old Cherbury' (No doubt in allusion to the
title of Lord Herbert of Cherbury.) (the nickname he gave me, and by
which he usually addressed me), 'none of these will do.'" Again, the
Rev. T. Butler, who was one of the Barmouth reading-party in 1828, says:
"He inoculated me with a taste for Botany which has stuck by me all my
life."

Archdeacon Watkins, another old college friend of my father's,
remembers him unearthing beetles in the willows between Cambridge and
Grantchester, and speaks of a certain beetle the remembrance of whose
name is "Crux major." (Panagaeus crux-major.) How enthusiastically must
my father have exulted over this beetle to have impressed its name on
a companion so that he remembers it after half a century! Archdeacon
Watkins goes on: "I do not forget the long and very interesting
conversations that we had about Brazilian scenery and tropical
vegetation of all sorts. Nor do I forget the way and the vehemence
with which he rubbed his chin when he got excited on such subjects, and
discoursed eloquently of lianas, orchids, etc."

He became intimate with Henslow, the Professor of Botany, and through
him with some other older members of the University. "But," Mr. Herbert
writes, "he always kept up the closest connection with the friends of
his own standing; and at our frequent social gatherings--at breakfast,
wine or supper parties--he was ever one of the most cheerful, the most
popular, and the most welcome."

My father formed one of a club for dining once a week, called the
Gourmet (Mr. Herbert mentions the name as 'The Glutton Club.') Club,
the members, besides himself and Mr. Herbert (from whom I quote), being
Whitley of St. John's, now Honorary Canon of Durham (Formerly Reader
in Natural Philosophy at Durham University.); Heaviside of Sidney, now
Canon of Norwich; Lovett Cameron of Trinity, now vicar of Shoreham;
Blane of Trinity, who held a high post during the Crimean war; H. Lowe
(Brother of Lord Sherbrooke.) (Now Sherbrooke) of Trinity Hall; and
Watkins of Emmanuel, now Archdeacon of York. The origin of the club's
name seems already to have become involved in obscurity. Mr. Herbert
says that it was chosen in derision of another "set of men who called
themselves by a long Greek name signifying 'fond of dainties,' but who
falsified their claim to such a designation by their weekly practice of
dining at some roadside inn, six miles from Cambridge, on mutton chops
or beans and bacon." Another old member of the club tells me that the
name arose because the members were given to making experiments on
"birds and beasts which were before unknown to human palate." He says
that hawk and bittern were tried, and that their zeal broke down over
an old brown owl, "which was indescribable." At any rate, the meetings
seemed to have been successful, and to have ended with "a game of mild
vingt-et-un."

Mr. Herbert gives an amusing account of the musical examinations
described by my father in his "Recollections." Mr. Herbert speaks
strongly of his love of music, and adds, "What gave him the greatest
delight was some grand symphony or overture of Mozart's or Beethoven's,
with their full harmonies." On one occasion Herbert remembers
"accompanying him to the afternoon service at King's, when we heard
a very beautiful anthem. At the end of one of the parts, which was
exceedingly impressive, he turned round to me and said, with a deep
sigh, 'How's your backbone?'" He often spoke of a feeling of coldness or
shivering in his back on hearing beautiful music.

Besides a love of music, he had certainly at this time a love of fine
literature; and Mr. Cameron tells me that he used to read Shakespeare
to my father in his rooms at Christ's, who took much pleasure in it.
He also speaks of his "great liking for first-class line engravings,
especially those of Raphael Morghen and Muller; and he spent hours in
the Fitzwilliam Museum in looking over the prints in that collection."

My father's letters to Fox show how sorely oppressed he felt by the
reading of an examination: "I am reading very hard, and have spirits for
nothing. I actually have not stuck a beetle this term." His despair over
mathematics must have been profound, when he expressed a hope that Fox's
silence is due to "your being ten fathoms deep in the Mathematics; and
if you are, God help you, for so am I, only with this difference, I
stick fast in the mud at the bottom, and there I shall remain." Mr.
Herbert says: "He had, I imagine, no natural turn for mathematics, and
he gave up his mathematical reading before he had mastered the first
part of Algebra, having had a special quarrel with Surds and the
Binomial Theorem."

We get some evidence from his letters to Fox of my father's intention
of going into the Church. "I am glad," he writes (March 18, 1829.), "to
hear that you are reading divinity. I should like to know what books
you are reading, and your opinions about them; you need not be afraid
of preaching to me prematurely." Mr. Herbert's sketch shows how doubts
arose in my father's mind as to the possibility of his taking Orders.
He writes, "We had an earnest conversation about going into Holy Orders;
and I remember his asking me, with reference to the question put by the
Bishop in the ordination service, 'Do you trust that you are inwardly
moved by the Holy Spirit, etc.,' whether I could answer in the
affirmative, and on my saying I could not, he said, 'Neither can I,
and therefore I cannot take orders.'" This conversation appears to have
taken place in 1829, and if so, the doubts here expressed must have been
quieted, for in May 1830, he speaks of having some thoughts of reading
divinity with Henslow.

[The greater number of the following letters are addressed by my father
to his cousin, William Darwin Fox. Mr. Fox's relationship to my father
is shown in the pedigree given in Chapter I. The degree of kinship
appears to have remained a problem to my father, as he signs himself in
one letter "cousin/n to the power 2." Their friendship was, in fact, due
to their being undergraduates together. My father's letters show clearly
enough how genuine the friendship was. In after years, distance, large
families, and ill-health on both sides, checked the intercourse; but a
warm feeling of friendship remained. The correspondence was never quite
dropped and continued till Mr. Fox's death in 1880. Mr. Fox took orders,
and worked as a country clergyman until forced by ill-health to leave
his living in Delamare Forest. His love of natural history remained
strong, and he became a skilled fancier of many kinds of birds, etc.
The index to 'Animals and Plants,' and my father's later correspondence,
show how much help he received from his old College friend.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.M. HERBERT. Saturday Evening [September 14, 1828].
(The postmark being Derby seems to show that the letter was written from
his cousin, W.D. Fox's house, Osmaston, near Derby.)

My dear old Cherbury,

I am about to fulfil my promise of writing to you, but I am sorry to add
there is a very selfish motive at the bottom. I am going to ask you
a great favour, and you cannot imagine how much you will oblige me by
procuring some more specimens of some insects which I dare say I can
describe. In the first place, I must inform you that I have taken
some of the rarest of the British Insects, and their being found near
Barmouth, is quite unknown to the Entomological world: I think I shall
write and inform some of the crack entomologists.

But now for business. SEVERAL more specimens, if you can procure them
without much trouble, of the following insects:--The violet-black
coloured beetle, found on Craig Storm (The top of the hill immediately
behind Barmouth was called Craig-Storm, a hybrid Cambro-English word.),
under stones, also a large smooth black one very like it; a bluish
metallic-coloured dung-beetle, which is VERY common on the hill-sides;
also, if you WOULD be so very kind as to cross the ferry, and you
will find a great number under the stones on the waste land of a long,
smooth, jet-black beetle (a great many of these); also, in the same
situation, a very small pinkish insect, with black spots, with a curved
thorax projecting beyond the head; also, upon the marshy land over the
ferry, near the sea, under old sea-weed, stones, etc., you will find a
small yellowish transparent beetle, with two or four blackish marks on
the back. Under these stones there are two sorts, one much darker than
the other; the lighter-coloured is that which I want. These last two
insects are EXCESSIVELY RARE, and you will really EXTREMELY oblige me by
taking all this trouble pretty soon; remember me most kindly to Butler,
tell him of my success, and I dare say both of you will easily recognise
these insects. I hope his caterpillars go on well. I think many of the
Chrysalises are well worth keeping. I really am quite ashamed [of] so
long a letter all about my own concerns; but do return good for evil,
and send me a long account of all your proceedings.

In the first week I killed seventy-five head of game--a very
contemptible number--but there are very few birds. I killed, however, a
brace of black game. Since then I have been staying at the Fox's, near
Derby; it is a very pleasant house, and the music meeting went off very
well. I want to hear how Yates likes his gun, and what use he has made
of it.

If the bottle is not large you can buy another for me, and when you pass
through Shrewsbury you can leave these treasures, and I hope, if you
possibly can, you will stay a day or two with me, as I hope I need
not say how glad I shall be to see you again. Fox remarked what deuced
good-natured fellows your friends at Barmouth must be; and if I did not
know how you and Butler were so, I would not think of giving you so much
trouble.

Believe me, my dear Herbert, Yours, most sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.
Remember me to all friends.


[In the following January we find him looking forward with pleasure to
the beginning of another year of his Cambridge life: he writes to Fox--

"I waited till to-day for the chance of a letter, but I will wait no
longer. I must most sincerely and cordially congratulate you on
having finished all your labours. I think your place a VERY GOOD one
considering by how much you have beaten many men who had the start of
you in reading. I do so wish I were now in Cambridge (a very selfish
wish, however, as I was not with you in all your troubles and misery),
to join in all the glory and happiness, which dangers gone by can give.
How we would talk, walk, and entomologise! Sappho should be the best of
bitches, and Dash, of dogs: then should be 'peace on earth, good will to
men,'--which, by the way, I always think the most perfect description of
happiness that words can give."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Cambridge, Thursday [February 26, 1829].

My dear Fox,

When I arrived here on Tuesday I found to my great grief and surprise, a
letter on my table which I had written to you about a fortnight ago, the
stupid porter never took the trouble of getting the letter forwarded. I
suppose you have been abusing me for a most ungrateful wretch; but I am
sure you will pity me now, as nothing is so vexatious as having written
a letter in vain.

Last Thursday I left Shrewsbury for London, and stayed there till
Tuesday, on which I came down here by the 'Times.' The first two days
I spent entirely with Mr. Hope (Founder of the Chair of Zoology at
Oxford.), and did little else but talk about and look at insects; his
collection is most magnificent, and he himself is the most generous of
entomologists; he has given me about 160 new species, and actually often
wanted to give me the rarest insects of which he had only two specimens.
He made many civil speeches, and hoped you will call on him some
time with me, whenever we should happen to be in London. He greatly
compliments our exertions in Entomology, and says we have taken a
wonderfully great number of good insects. On Sunday I spent the day with
Holland, who lent me a horse to ride in the Park with.

On Monday evening I drank tea with Stephens (J.F. Stephens, author of 'A
Manual of British Coleoptera,' 1839, and other works.); his cabinet is
more magnificent than the most zealous entomologist could dream of; he
appears to be a very good-humoured pleasant little man. Whilst in town I
went to the Royal Institution, Linnean Society, and Zoological Gardens,
and many other places where naturalists are gregarious. If you had been
with me, I think London would be a very delightful place; as things
were, it was much pleasanter than I could have supposed such a dreary
wilderness of houses to be.

I shot whilst in Shrewsbury a Dundiver (female Goosander, as I suppose
you know). Shaw has stuffed it, and when I have an opportunity I will
send it to Osmaston. There have been shot also five Waxen Chatterers,
three of which Shaw has for sale; would you like to purchase a specimen?
I have not yet thanked you for your last very long and agreeable letter.
It would have been still more agreeable had it contained the joyful
intelligence that you were coming up here; my two solitary breakfasts
have already made me aware how very very much I shall miss you.

...

Believe me, My dear old Fox, Most sincerely yours, C. DARWIN.


[Later on in the Lent term he writes to Fox:--

"I am leading a quiet everyday sort of a life; a little of Gibbon's
History in the morning, and a good deal of "Van John" in the evening;
this, with an occasional ride with Simcox and constitutional with
Whitley, makes up the regular routine of my days. I see a good deal both
of Herbert and Whitley, and the more I see of them increases every day
the respect I have for their excellent understandings and dispositions.
They have been giving some very gay parties, nearly sixty men there both
evenings."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Christ's College [Cambridge], April 1
[1829].

My dear Fox,

In your letter to Holden you are pleased to observe "that of all the
blackguards you ever met with I am the greatest." Upon this observation
I shall make no remarks, excepting that I must give you all due credit
for acting on it most rigidly. And now I should like to know in what one
particular are you less of a blackguard than I am? You idle old wretch,
why have you not answered my last letter, which I am sure I forwarded to
Clifton nearly three weeks ago? If I was not really very anxious to hear
what you are doing, I should have allowed you to remain till you thought
it worth while to treat me like a gentleman. And now having vented my
spleen in scolding you, and having told you, what you must know, how
very much and how anxiously I want to hear how you and your family are
getting on at Clifton, the purport of this letter is finished. If you
did but know how often I think of you, and how often I regret your
absence, I am sure I should have heard from you long enough ago.

I find Cambridge rather stupid, and as I know scarcely any one that
walks, and this joined with my lips not being quite so well, has reduced
me to a sort of hybernation... I have caught Mr. Harbour letting --
have the first pick of the beetles; accordingly we have made our final
adieus, my part in the affecting scene consisted in telling him he was a
d--d rascal, and signifying I should kick him down the stairs if ever
he appeared in my rooms again. It seemed altogether mightily to
surprise the young gentleman. I have no news to tell you; indeed, when
a correspondence has been broken off like ours has been, it is difficult
to make the first start again. Last night there was a terrible fire at
Linton, eleven miles from Cambridge. Seeing the reflection so plainly in
the sky, Hall, Woodyeare, Turner, and myself thought we would ride and
see it. We set out at half-past nine, and rode like incarnate devils
there, and did not return till two in the morning. Altogether it was a
most awful sight. I cannot conclude without telling you, that of all the
blackguards I ever met with, you are the greatest and the best.

C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. [Cambridge, Thursday, April 23, 1829.]

My dear Fox,

I have delayed answering your last letter for these few days, as I
thought that under such melancholy circumstances my writing to you would
be probably only giving you trouble. This morning I received a letter
from Catherine informing me of that event (The death of Fox's sister,
Mrs. Bristowe.), which, indeed, from your letter, I had hardly dared to
hope would have happened otherwise. I feel most sincerely and deeply for
you and all your family; but at the same time, as far as any one can,
by his own good principles and religion, be supported under such a
misfortune, you, I am assured, will know where to look for such support.
And after so pure and holy a comfort as the Bible affords, I am equally
assured how useless the sympathy of all friends must appear, although
it be as heartfelt and sincere, as I hope you believe me capable of
feeling. At such a time of deep distress I will say nothing more,
excepting that I trust your father and Mrs. Fox bear this blow as well
as, under such circumstances, can be hoped for.

I am afraid it will be a long time, my dear Fox, before we meet; till
then, believe me at all times,

Yours most affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Shrewsbury, Friday [July 4, 1829].

My dear Fox,

I should have written to you before only that whilst our expedition
lasted I was too much engaged, and the conclusion was so unfortunate,
that I was too unhappy to write to you till this week's quiet at home.
The thoughts of Woodhouse next week has at last given me courage to
relate my unfortunate case.

I started from this place about a fortnight ago to take an entomological
trip with Mr. Hope through all North Wales; and Barmouth was our first
destination. The two first days I went on pretty well, taking several
good insects; but for the rest of that week my lips became suddenly so
bad (Probably with eczema, from which he often suffered.), and I myself
not very well, that I was unable to leave the room, and on the Monday I
retreated with grief and sorrow back again to Shrewsbury. The first two
days I took some good insects...But the days that I was unable to go
out, Mr. Hope did wonders...and to-day I have received another parcel
of insects from him, such Colymbetes, such Carabi, and such magnificent
Elaters (two species of the bright scarlet sort). I am sure you will
properly sympathise with my unfortunate situation: I am determined I
will go over the same ground that he does before autumn comes, and if
working hard will procure insects I will bring home a glorious
stock....

My dear Fox, Yours most sincerely, CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Shrewsbury, July 18, 1829.

I am going to Maer next week in order to entomologise, and shall
stay there a week, and for the rest of this summer I intend to lead a
perfectly idle and wandering life...You see I am much in the same state
that you are, with this difference, you make good resolutions and never
keep them; I never make them, so cannot keep them; it is all very well
writing in this manner, but I must read for my Little-go. Graham smiled
and bowed so very civilly, when he told me that he was one of the
six appointed to make the examination stricter, and that they were
determined this would make it a very different thing from any previous
examination, that from all this I am sure it will be the very devil to
pay amongst all idle men and entomologists. Erasmus, we expect home in
a few weeks' time: he intends passing next winter in Paris. Be sure you
order the two lists of insects published by Stephens, one printed on
both sides, and the other only on one; you will find them very useful in
many points of view.

Dear old Fox, yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Christ's College, Thursday [October 16,
1829].

My dear Fox,

I am afraid you will be very angry with me for not having written during
the Music Meeting, but really I was worked so hard that I had no time; I
arrived here on Monday and found my rooms in dreadful confusion, as
they have been taking up the floor, and you may suppose that I have had
plenty to do for these two days. The Music Meeting (At Birmingham.) was
the most glorious thing I ever experienced; and as for Malibran, words
cannot praise her enough, she is quite the most charming person I
ever saw. We had extracts out of several of the best operas, acted in
character, and you cannot imagine how very superior it made the concerts
to any I ever heard before. J. de Begnis (De Begnis's Christian name
was Giuseppe.) acted 'Il Fanatico' in character; being dressed up an
extraordinary figure gives a much greater effect to his acting. He kept
the whole theatre in roars of laughter. I liked Madame Blasis very much,
but nothing will do after Malibran, who sung some comic songs, and [a]
person's heart must have been made of stone not to have lost it to her.
I lodged very near the Wedgwoods, and lived entirely with them, which
was very pleasant, and had you been there it would have been quite
perfect. It knocked me up most dreadfully, and I will never attempt
again to do two things the same day.

...

CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. [Cambridge] Thursday [March, 1830].

My dear Fox,

I am through my Little-Go!!! I am too much exalted to humble myself by
apologising for not having written before. But I assure you before I
went in, and when my nerves were in a shattered and weak condition,
your injured person often rose before my eyes and taunted me with my
idleness. But I am through, through, through. I could write the whole
sheet full with this delightful word. I went in yesterday, and have just
heard the joyful news. I shall not know for a week which class I am in.
The whole examination is carried on in a different system. It has one
grand advantage--being over in one day. They are rather strict, and ask
a wonderful number of questions.

And now I want to know something about your plans; of course you intend
coming up here: what fun we will have together; what beetles we will
catch; it will do my heart good to go once more together to some of our
old haunts. I have two very promising pupils in Entomology, and we will
make regular campaigns into the Fens. Heaven protect the beetles and
Mr. Jenyns, for we won't leave him a pair in the whole country. My new
Cabinet is come down, and a gay little affair it is.

And now for the time--I think I shall go for a few days to town to hear
an opera and see Mr. Hope; not to mention my brother also, whom I should
have no objection to see. If I go pretty soon, you can come afterwards,
but if you will settle your plans definitely, I will arrange mine,
so send me a letter by return of post. And I charge you let it be
favourable--that is to say, come directly. Holden has been ordained,
and drove the Coach out on the Monday. I do not think he is looking very
well. Chapman wants you and myself to pay him a visit when you come up,
and begs to be remembered to you. You must excuse this short letter,
as I have no end more to send off by this day's post. I long to see you
again, and till then,

My dear good old Fox, Yours most sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.


[In August he was in North Wales and wrote to Fox:--

"I have been intending to write every hour for the last fortnight, but
REALLY have had no time. I left Shrewsbury this day fortnight ago, and
have since that time been working from morning to night in catching fish
or beetles. This is literally the first idle day I have had to myself;
for on the rainy days I go fishing, on the good ones entomologising. You
may recollect that for the fortnight previous to all this, you told me
not to write, so that I hope I have made out some sort of defence for
not having sooner answered your two long and very agreeable letters."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. [Cambridge, November 5, 1830.]

My dear Fox,

I have so little time at present, and am so disgusted by reading that
I have not the heart to write to anybody. I have only written once home
since I came up. This must excuse me for not having answered your three
letters, for which I am really very much obliged...

I have not stuck an insect this term, and scarcely opened a case. If
I had time I would have sent you the insects which I have so long
promised; but really I have not spirits or time to do anything. Reading
makes me quite desperate; the plague of getting up all my subjects is
next thing to intolerable. Henslow is my tutor, and a most ADMIRABLE one
he makes; the hour with him is the pleasantest in the whole day. I think
he is quite the most perfect man I ever met with. I have been to some
very pleasant parties there this term. His good-nature is unbounded.

I am sure you will be sorry to hear poor old Whitley's father is dead.
In a worldly point of view it is of great consequence to him, as it will
prevent him going to the Bar for some time.--(Be sure answer this:) What
did you pay for the iron hoop you had made in Shrewsbury? Because I
do not mean to pay the whole of the Cambridge man's bill. You need not
trouble yourself about the Phallus, as I have bought up both species. I
have heard men say that Henslow has some curious religious opinions. I
never perceived anything of it, have you? I am very glad to hear, after
all your delays, you have heard of a curacy where you may read all the
commandments without endangering your throat. I am also still more glad
to hear that your mother continues steadily to improve. I do trust that
you will have no further cause for uneasiness. With every wish for your
happiness, my dear old Fox,

Believe me yours most sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Cambridge, Sunday, January 23, 1831.

My dear Fox,

I do hope you will excuse my not writing before I took my degree. I felt
a quite inexplicable aversion to write to anybody. But now I do most
heartily congratulate you upon passing your examination, and hope you
find your curacy comfortable. If it is my last shilling (I have not
many), I will come and pay you a visit.

I do not know why the degree should make one so miserable, both before
and afterwards. I recollect you were sufficiently wretched before, and
I can assure [you] I am now, and what makes it the more ridiculous is, I
know not what about. I believe it is a beautiful provision of nature to
make one regret the less leaving so pleasant a place as Cambridge; and
amongst all its pleasures--I say it for once and for all--none so great
as my friendship with you. I sent you a newspaper yesterday, in which
you will see what a good place [10th] I have got in the Poll. As for
Christ's, did you ever see such a college for producing Captains and
Apostles? (The "Captain" is at the head of the "Poll": the "Apostles"
are the last twelve in the Mathematical Tripos.) There are no men either
at Emmanuel or Christ's plucked. Cameron is gulfed, together with other
three Trinity scholars! My plans are not at all settled. I think I shall
keep this term, and then go and economise at Shrewsbury, return and take
my degree.

A man may be excused for writing so much about himself when he has
just passed the examination; so you must excuse [me]. And on the same
principle do you write a letter brimful of yourself and plans. I want to
know something about your examination. Tell me about the state of your
nerves; what books you got up, and how perfect. I take an interest
about that sort of thing, as the time will come when I must suffer. Your
tutor, Thompson, begged to be remembered to you, and so does Whitley.
If you will answer this, I will send as many stupid answers as you can
desire.

Believe me, dear Fox, CHAS. DARWIN.




CHAPTER 1.V. -- THE APPOINTMENT TO THE 'BEAGLE.'

[In a letter addressed to Captain Fitz-Roy, before the "Beagle" sailed,
my father wrote, "What a glorious day the 4th of November (The "Beagle"
did not however make her final and successful start until December 27.)
will be to me--my second life will then commence, and it shall be as a
birthday for the rest of my life."]

The circumstances which led to this second birth--so much more important
than my father then imagined--are connected with his Cambridge life, but
may be more appropriately told in the present chapter. Foremost in the
chain of circumstances which lead to his appointment to the "Beagle",
was my father's friendship with Professor Henslow. He wrote in a
pocket-book or diary, which contain a brief record of dates, etc.,
throughout his life:--

"1831. CHRISTMAS.--Passed my examination for B.A. degree and kept the
two following terms.

"During these months lived much with Professor Henslow, often dining
with him and walking with him; became slightly acquainted with several
of the learned men in Cambridge, which much quickened the zeal which
dinner parties and hunting had not destroyed.

"In the spring paid Mr. Dawes a visit with Ramsay and Kirby, and talked
over an excursion to Teneriffe. In the spring Henslow persuaded me
to think of Geology, and introduced me to Sedgwick. During Midsummer
geologised a little in Shropshire.

"AUGUST.--Went on Geological tour (Mentioned by Sedgwick in his preface
to Salter's 'Catalogue of Cambrian and Silurian Fossils,' 1873.) by
Llangollen, Ruthin, Conway, Bangor, and Capel Curig, where I left
Professor Sedgwick, and crossed the mountain to Barmouth."

In a letter to Fox (May, 1831), my father writes:--"I am very busy...and
see a great deal of Henslow, whom I do not know whether I love or
respect most." His feeling for this admirable man is finely expressed
in a letter which he wrote to Rev. L. Blomefield (then Rev. L. Jenyns),
when the latter was engaged in his 'Memoir of Professor Henslow'
(published 1862). The passage ('Memoir of the Rev. John Stevens Henslow,
M.A.,' by the Rev. Leonard Jenyns. 8vo. London, 1862, page 51.) has been
made use of in the first of the memorial notices written for 'Nature,'
and Mr. Romanes points out that my father, "while describing the
character of another, is unconsciously giving a most accurate
description of his own":--

"I went to Cambridge early in the year 1828, and soon became acquainted,
through some of my brother entomologists, with Professor Henslow, for
all who cared for any branch of natural history were equally encouraged
by him. Nothing could be more simple, cordial, and unpretending than the
encouragement which he afforded to all young naturalists. I soon became
intimate with him, for he had a remarkable power of making the young
feel completely at ease with him; though we were all awe-struck with the
amount of his knowledge. Before I saw him, I heard one young man sum up
his attainments by simply saying that he knew everything. When I reflect
how immediately we felt at perfect ease with a man older, and in every
way so immensely our superior, I think it was as much owing to the
transparent sincerity of his character as to his kindness of heart; and,
perhaps, even still more, to a highly remarkable absence in him of all
self-consciousness. One perceived at once that he never thought of his
own varied knowledge or clear intellect, but solely on the subject in
hand. Another charm, which must have struck every one, was that his
manner to old and distinguished persons and to the youngest student was
exactly the same: and to all he showed the same winning courtesy. He
would receive with interest the most trifling observation in any branch
of natural history; and however absurd a blunder one might make,
he pointed it out so clearly and kindly, that one left him no way
disheartened, but only determined to be more accurate the next time. In
short, no man could be better formed to win the entire confidence of the
young, and to encourage them in their pursuits.

"His lectures on Botany were universally popular, and as clear as
daylight. So popular were they, that several of the older members of
the University attended successive courses. Once every week he kept open
house in the evening, and all who cared for natural history attended
these parties, which, by thus favouring inter-communication, did the
same good in Cambridge, in a very pleasant manner, as the Scientific
Societies do in London. At these parties many of the most distinguished
members of the University occasionally attended; and when only a few
were present, I have listened to the great men of those days, conversing
on all sorts of subjects, with the most varied and brilliant powers.
This was no small advantage to some of the younger men, as it stimulated
their mental activity and ambition. Two or three times in each session
he took excursions with his botanical class; either a long walk to the
habitat of some rare plant, or in a barge down the river to the fens, or
in coaches to some more distant place, as to Gamlingay, to see the wild
lily of the valley, and to catch on the heath the rare natter-jack.
These excursions have left a delightful impression on my mind. He was,
on such occasions, in as good spirits as a boy, and laughed as
heartily as a boy at the misadventures of those who chased the splendid
swallow-tail butterflies across the broken and treacherous fens. He used
to pause every now and then to lecture on some plant or other object;
and something he could tell us on every insect, shell, or fossil
collected, for he had attended to every branch of natural history. After
our day's work we used to dine at some inn or house, and most jovial we
then were. I believe all who joined these excursions will agree with me
that they have left an enduring impression of delight on our minds.

"As time passed on at Cambridge I became very intimate with Professor
Henslow, and his kindness was unbounded; he continually asked me to his
house, and allowed me to accompany him in his walks. He talked on all
subjects, including his deep sense of religion, and was entirely open. I
own more than I can express to this excellent man...

"During the years when I associated so much with Professor Henslow, I
never once saw his temper even ruffled. He never took an ill-natured
view of any one's character, though very far from blind to the foibles
of others. It always struck me that his mind could not be even touched
by any paltry feeling of vanity, envy, or jealousy. With all this
equability of temper and remarkable benevolence, there was no insipidity
of character. A man must have been blind not to have perceived that
beneath this placid exterior there was a vigorous and determined will.
When principle came into play, no power on earth could have turned him
one hair's-breadth...

"Reflecting over his character with gratitude and reverence, his
moral attributes rise, as they should do in the highest character, in
pre-eminence over his intellect."

In a letter to Rev. L. Blomefield (Jenyns), May 24, 1862, my father
wrote with the same feelings that he had expressed in his letters thirty
years before:--

"I thank you most sincerely for your kind present of your Memoir of
Henslow. I have read about half, and it has interested me much. I do not
think that I could have venerated him more than I did; but your book has
even exalted his character in my eyes. From turning over the pages of
the latter half, I should think your account would be invaluable to any
clergyman who wished to follow poor dear Henslow's noble example. What
an admirable man he was."

The geological work mentioned in the quotation from my father's
pocket-book was doubtless of importance as giving him some practical
experience, and perhaps of more importance in helping to give him some
confidence in himself. In July of the same year, 1831, he was "working
like a tiger" at Geology, and trying to make a map of Shropshire, but
not finding it "as easy as I expected."

In writing to Henslow about the same time, he gives some account of his
work:--

"I should have written to you some time ago, only I was determined
to wait for the clinometer, and I am very glad to say I think it
will answer admirably. I put all the tables in my bedroom at every
conceivable angle and direction. I will venture to say I have measured
them as accurately as any geologist going could do...I have been working
at so many things that I have not got on much with geology. I suspect
the first expedition I take, clinometer and hammer in hand, will send me
back very little wiser and a good deal more puzzled than when I started.
As yet I have only indulged in hypotheses, but they are such powerful
ones that I suppose, if they were put into action for but one day, the
world would come to an end."

He was evidently most keen to get to work with Sedgwick, for he wrote
to Henslow: "I have not heard from Professor Sedgwick, so I am afraid
he will not pay the Severn formations a visit. I hope and trust you did
your best to urge him."

My father has given in his Recollections some account of this Tour.

There too we read of the projected excursion to the Canaries, of which
slight mention occurs in letters to Fox and Henslow.

In April 1831 he writes to Fox: "At present I talk, think, and dream of
a scheme I have almost hatched of going to the Canary Islands. I
have long had a wish of seeing tropical scenery and vegetation, and,
according to Humboldt, Teneriffe is a very pretty specimen." And again
in May: "As for my Canary scheme, it is rash of you to ask questions;
my other friends most sincerely wish me there, I plague them so with
talking about tropical scenery, etc. Eyton will go next summer, and I am
learning Spanish."

Later on in the summer the scheme took more definite form, and the date
seems to have been fixed for June, 1832. He got information in London
about passage-money, and in July was working at Spanish and calling
Fox "un grandisimo lebron," in proof of his knowledge of the language;
which, however, he found "intensely stupid." But even then he seems
to have had some doubts about his companions' zeal, for he writes to
Henslow (July 27, 1831): "I hope you continue to fan your Canary ardour.
I read and re-read Humboldt; do you do the same? I am sure nothing will
prevent us seeing the Great Dragon Tree."

Geological work and Teneriffe dreams carried him through the summer,
till on returning from Barmouth for the sacred 1st of September, he
received the offer of appointment as Naturalist to the "Beagle".

The following extract from the pocket-book will be a help in reading the
letters:--

"Returned to Shrewsbury at end of August. Refused offer of voyage.

"September.--Went to Maer, returned with Uncle Jos. to Shrewsbury,
thence to Cambridge. London.

"11th.--Went with Captain Fitz-Roy in steamer to Plymouth to see the
"Beagle".

"22nd.--Returned to Shrewsbury, passing through Cambridge.

"October 2nd.--Took leave of my home. Stayed in London.

"24th--Reached Plymouth.

"October and November.--These months very miserable.

"December 10th.--Sailed, but were obliged to put back.

"21st.--Put to sea again, and were driven back.

"27th.--Sailed from England on our Circumnavigation."


GEORGE PEACOCK (Formerly Dean of Ely, and Lowndean Professor of
Astronomy at Cambridge.) TO J.S. HENSLOW. 7 Suffolk Street, Pall Mall
East. [1831.]

My dear Henslow,

Captain Fitz-Roy is going out to survey the southern coast of Tierra
del Fuego, and afterwards to visit many of the South Sea Islands, and to
return by the Indian Archipelago. The vessel is fitted out expressly
for scientific purposes, combined with the survey; it will furnish,
therefore, a rare opportunity for a naturalist, and it would be a great
misfortune that it should be lost.

An offer has been made to me to recommend a proper person to go out as
a naturalist with this expedition; he will be treated with every
consideration. The Captain is a young man of very pleasing manners (a
nephew of the Duke of Grafton), of great zeal in his profession, and who
is very highly spoken of; if Leonard Jenyns could go, what treasures he
might bring home with him, as the ship would be placed at his disposal
whenever his inquiries made it necessary or desirable. In the absence
of so accomplished a naturalist, is there any person whom you could
strongly recommend? he must be such a person as would do credit to our
recommendation. Do think of this subject, it would be a serious loss to
the cause of natural science if this fine opportunity was lost....

The ship sails about the end of September.

Write immediately, and tell me what can be done.

Believe me, My dear Henslow, Most truly yours, GEORGE PEACOCK.


J.S. HENSLOW TO C. DARWIN. Cambridge, August 24, 1831.

My dear Darwin,

Before I enter upon the immediate business of this letter, let us
condole together upon the loss of our inestimable friend poor Ramsay, of
whose death you have undoubtedly heard long before this.

I will not now dwell upon this painful subject, as I shall hope to see
you shortly, fully expecting that you will eagerly catch at the offer
which is likely to be made you of a trip to Tierra del Fuego, and home
by the East Indies. I have been asked by Peacock, who will read and
forward this to you from London, to recommend him a Naturalist as
companion to Captain Fitz-Roy, employed by Government to survey the
southern extremity of America. I have stated that I consider you to be
the best qualified person I know of who is likely to undertake such a
situation. I state this not in the supposition of your being a FINISHED
naturalist, but as amply qualified for collecting, observing, and
noting, anything worthy to be noted in Natural History. Peacock has the
appointment at his disposal, and if he cannot find a man willing to
take the office, the opportunity will probably be lost. Captain Fitz-Roy
wants a man (I understand) more as a companion than a mere collector,
and would not take any one, however good a naturalist, who was not
recommended to him likewise as a GENTLEMAN. Particulars of salary, etc.,
I know nothing. The voyage is to last two years, and if you take plenty
of books with you, anything you please may be done. You will have ample
opportunities at command. In short, I suppose there never was a finer
chance for a man of zeal and spirit; Captain Fitz-Roy is a young man.
What I wish you to do is instantly to come and consult with Peacock (at
No. 7 Suffolk Street, Pall Mall East, or else at the University Club),
and learn further particulars. Don't put on any modest doubts or fears
about your disqualifications, for I assure you I think you are the very
man they are in search of; so conceive yourself to be tapped on the
shoulder by your bum-bailiff and affectionate friend,

J.S. HENSLOW.

The expedition is to sail on 25th September (at earliest), so there is
no time to be lost.


G. PEACOCK TO C. DARWIN. [1831.]

My dear Sir,

I received Henslow's letter last night too late to forward it to you by
the post; a circumstance which I do not regret, as it has given me
an opportunity of seeing Captain Beaufort at the Admiralty (the
Hydrographer), and of stating to him the offer which I have to make to
you. He entirely approves of it, and you may consider the situation as
at your absolute disposal. I trust that you will accept it, as it is
an opportunity which should not be lost, and I look forward with great
interest to the benefit which our collections of Natural History may
receive from your labours.

The circumstances are these;--

Captain Fitz-Roy (a nephew of the Duke of Grafton) sails at the end of
September, in a ship to survey, in the first instance, the South Coast
of Tierra del Fuego, afterwards to visit the South Sea Islands, and to
return by the Indian Archipelago to England. The expedition is entirely
for scientific purposes, and the ship will generally wait your
leisure for researches in Natural History, etc. Captain Fitz-Roy is a
public-spirited and zealous officer, of delightful manners, and greatly
beloved by all his brother officers. He went with Captain Beechey (For
'Beechey' read 'King.' I do not find the name Fitz-Roy in the list of
Beechey's officers. The Fuegians were brought back from Captain King's
voyage.), and spent 1500 pounds in bringing over and educating at his
own charge three natives of Patagonia. He engages at his own expense an
artist at 200 pounds a year to go with him. You may be sure, therefore,
of having a very pleasant companion, who will enter heartily into all
your views.

The ship sails about the end of September, and you must lose no time
in making known your acceptance to Captain Beaufort, Admiralty
Hydrographer. I have had a good deal of correspondence about this matter
[with Henslow?], who feels, in common with myself, the greatest anxiety
that you should go. I hope that no other arrangements are likely to
interfere with it....

The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will
furnish you with an official appointment, and every accommodation. If a
salary should be required, however, I am inclined to think that it would
be granted.

Believe me, my dear Sir, Very truly yours, GEORGE PEACOCK.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Shrewsbury, Tuesday [August 30?, 1831].

My dear Sir,

Mr. Peacock's letter arrived on Saturday, and I received it late
yesterday evening. As far as my own mind is concerned, I should, I think
CERTAINLY, most gladly have accepted the opportunity which you so kindly
have offered me. But my father, although he does not decidedly refuse
me, gives such strong advice against going, that I should not be
comfortable if I did not follow it.

My father's objections are these: the unfitting me to settle down as a
Clergyman, my little habit of seafaring, THE SHORTNESS OF THE TIME, and
the chance of my not suiting Captain Fitz-Roy. It is certainly a very
serious objection, the very short time for all my preparations, as not
only body but mind wants making up for such an undertaking. But if it
had not been for my father I would have taken all risks. What was the
reason that a Naturalist was not long ago fixed upon? I am very much
obliged for the trouble you have had about it; there certainly could not
have been a better opportunity....

My trip with Sedgwick answered most perfectly. I did not hear of poor
Mr. Ramsay's loss till a few days before your letter. I have been
lucky hitherto in never losing any person for whom I had any esteem or
affection. My acquaintance, although very short, was sufficient to give
me those feelings in a great degree. I can hardly make myself believe he
is no more. He was the finest character I ever knew.

Yours most sincerely, My dear Sir, CH. DARWIN.

I have written to Mr. Peacock, and I mentioned that I have asked you to
send one line in the chance of his not getting my letter. I have also
asked him to communicate with Captain Fitz-Roy. Even if I was to go, my
father disliking would take away all energy, and I should want a good
stock of that. Again I must thank you, it adds a little to the heavy but
pleasant load of gratitude which I owe to you.


CHARLES DARWIN TO R.W. DARWIN. [Maer] August 31, [1831].

My dear Father,

I am afraid I am going to make you again very uncomfortable. But,
upon consideration, I think you will excuse me once again, stating
my opinions on the offer of the voyage. My excuse and reason is the
different way all the Wedgwoods view the subject from what you and my
sisters do.

I have given Uncle Jos (Josiah Wedgwood.) what I fervently trust is an
accurate and full list of your objections, and he is kind enough to give
his opinions on all. The list and his answers will be enclosed. But may
I beg of you one favour, it will be doing me the greatest kindness, if
you will send me a decided answer, yes or no? If the latter, I should be
most ungrateful if I did not implicitly yield to your better judgment,
and to the kindest indulgence you have shown me all through my life;
and you may rely upon it I will never mention the subject again. If
your answer should be yes; I will go directly to Henslow and consult
deliberately with him, and then come to Shrewsbury.

The danger appears to me and all the Wedgwoods not great. The expense
cannot be serious, and the time I do not think, anyhow, would be more
thrown away then if I stayed at home. But pray do not consider that I
am so bent on going that I would for one SINGLE MOMENT hesitate, if you
thought that after a short period you should continue uncomfortable.

I must again state I cannot think it would unfit me hereafter for a
steady life. I do hope this letter will not give you much uneasiness. I
send it by the car to-morrow morning; if you make up your mind directly
will you send me an answer on the following day by the same means? If
this letter should not find you at home, I hope you will answer as soon
as you conveniently can.

I do not know what to say about Uncle Jos' kindness; I never can forget
how he interests himself about me.

Believe me, my dear father, Your affectionate son, CHARLES DARWIN.


[Here follows the list of objections which are referred to in the
following letter:--

1. Disreputable to my character as a Clergyman hereafter.

2. A wild scheme.

3. That they must have offered to many others before me the place of
Naturalist.

4. And from its not being accepted there must be some serious objection
to the vessel or expedition.

5. That I should never settle down to a steady life hereafter.

6. That my accommodations would be most uncomfortable.

7. That you [i.e. Dr. Darwin] should consider it as again changing my
profession.

8. That it would be a useless undertaking.]


JOSIAH WEDGWOOD TO R.W. DARWIN. Maer, August 31, 1831. [Read this last.]
(In C. Darwin's writing.)

My dear Doctor,

I feel the responsibility of your application to me on the offer that
has been made to Charles as being weighty, but as you have desired
Charles to consult me, I cannot refuse to give the result of such
consideration as I have been able to [give?] it.

Charles has put down what he conceives to be your principal objections,
and I think the best course I can take will be to state what occurs to
me upon each of them.

1. I should not think that it would be in any degree disreputable to
his character as a Clergyman. I should on the contrary think the offer
honourable to him; and the pursuit of Natural History, though certainly
not professional, is very suitable to a clergyman.

2. I hardly know how to meet this objection, but he would have definite
objects upon which to employ himself, and might acquire and strengthen
habits of application, and I should think would be as likely to do so as
in any way in which he is likely to pass the next two years at home.

3. The notion did not occur to me in reading the letters; and on reading
them again with that object in my mind I see no ground for it.

4. I cannot conceive that the Admiralty would send out a bad vessel on
such a service. As to objections to the expedition, they will differ in
each man's case, and nothing would, I think, be inferred in Charles's
case, if it were known that others had objected.

5. You are a much better judge of Charles's character than I can be. If
on comparing this mode of spending the next two years with the way in
which he will probably spend them, if he does not accept this offer, you
think him more likely to be rendered unsteady and unable to settle, it
is undoubtedly a weighty objection. Is it not the case that sailors are
prone to settle in domestic and quiet habits?

6. I can form no opinion on this further than that if appointed by the
Admiralty he will have a claim to be as well accommodated as the vessel
will allow.

7. If I saw Charles now absorbed in professional studies I should
probably think it would not be advisable to interrupt them; but this is
not, and, I think, will not be the case with him. His present pursuit
of knowledge is in the same track as he would have to follow in the
expedition.

8. The undertaking would be useless as regards his profession, but
looking upon him as a man of enlarged curiosity, it affords him such an
opportunity of seeing men and things as happens to few.

You will bear in mind that I have had very little time for
consideration, and that you and Charles are the persons who must decide.

I am, My dear Doctor, Affectionately yours, JOSIAH WEDGWOOD.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Cambridge, Red Lion [September 2], 1831.

My dear Sir,

I am just arrived; you will guess the reason. My father has changed his
mind. I trust the place is not given away.

I am very much fatigued, and am going to bed.

I dare say you have not yet got my second letter.

How soon shall I come to you in the morning? Send a verbal answer.

Good-night, Yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS SUSAN DARWIN. Cambridge, Sunday Morning
[September 4].

My dear Susan,

As a letter would not have gone yesterday, I put off writing till
to-day. I had rather a wearisome journey, but got into Cambridge very
fresh. The whole of yesterday I spent with Henslow, thinking of what is
to be done, and that I find is a great deal. By great good luck I know
a man of the name of Wood, nephew of Lord Londonderry. He is a great
friend of Captain Fitz-Roy, and has written to him about me. I heard
a part of Captain Fitz-Roy's letter, dated some time ago, in which he
says: "I have a right good set of officers, and most of my men have been
there before." It seems he has been there for the last few years; he was
then second in command with the same vessel that he has now chosen. He
is only twenty-three years old, but [has] seen a deal of service, and
won the gold medal at Portsmouth. The Admiralty say his maps are most
perfect. He had choice of two vessels, and he chose the smallest.
Henslow will give me letters to all travellers in town whom he thinks
may assist me.

Peacock has sole appointment of Naturalist. The first person offered
was Leonard Jenyns, who was so near accepting it that he packed up
his clothes. But having [a] living, he did not think it right to leave
it--to the great regret of all his family. Henslow himself was not very
far from accepting it, for Mrs. Henslow most generously, and without
being asked, gave her consent; but she looked so miserable that Henslow
at once settled the point....

I am afraid there will be a good deal of expense at first. Henslow
is much against taking many things; it is [the] mistake all young
travellers fall into. I write as if it was settled, but Henslow tells me
BY NO MEANS to make up my mind till I have had long conversations
with Captains Beaufort and Fitz-Roy. Good-bye. You will hear from me
constantly. Direct 17 Spring Gardens. TELL NOBODY in Shropshire yet. Be
sure not.

C. DARWIN.

I was so tired that evening I was in Shrewsbury that I thanked none of
you for your kindness half so much as I felt.

Love to my father.

The reason I don't want people told in Shropshire: in case I should not
go, it will make it more flat.


CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS S. DARWIN. 17 Spring Gardens, Monday [September
5, 1831].

I have so little time to spare that I have none to waste in re-writing
letters, so that you must excuse my bringing up the other with me and
altering it. The last letter was written in the morning. In [the] middle
of [the] day, Wood received a letter from Captain Fitz-Roy, which I must
say was MOST straightforward and GENTLEMANLIKE, but so much against my
going, that I immediately gave up the scheme; and Henslow did the same,
saying that he thought Peacock had acted VERY WRONG in misrepresenting
things so much.

I scarcely thought of going to town, but here I am; and now for more
details, and much more promising ones. Captain Fitz-Roy is [in] town,
and I have seen him; it is no use attempting to praise him as much as
I feel inclined to do, for you would not believe me. One thing I am
certain, nothing could be more open and kind than he was to me. It seems
he had promised to take a friend with him, who is in office and cannot
go, and he only received the letter five minutes before I came in;
and this makes things much better for me, as want of room was one of
Fitz-Roy's greatest objections. He offers me to go share in everything
in his cabin if I like to come, and every sort of accommodation that
I can have, but they will not be numerous. He says nothing would be so
miserable for him as having me with him if I was uncomfortable, as in
a small vessel we must be thrown together, and thought it his duty
to state everything in the worst point of view. I think I shall go on
Sunday to Plymouth to see the vessel.

There is something most extremely attractive in his manners and way of
coming straight to the point. If I live with him, he says I must live
poorly--no wine, and the plainest dinners. The scheme is not certainly
so good as Peacock describes. Captain Fitz-Roy advises me not [to] make
up my mind quite yet, but that, seriously, he thinks it will have much
more pleasure than pain for me. The vessel does not sail till the 10th
of October. It contains sixty men, five or six officers, etc., but is a
small vessel. It will probably be out nearly three years. I shall pay
to the mess the same as [the] Captain does himself, 30 pounds per annum;
and Fitz-Roy says if I spend, including my outfitting, 500 pounds, it
will be beyond the extreme. But now for still worse news. The round the
world is not CERTAIN, but the chance most excellent. Till that point is
decided, I will not be so. And you may believe, after the many changes I
have made, that nothing but my reason shall decide me.

Fitz-Roy says the stormy sea is exaggerated; that if I do not choose to
remain with them, I can at any time get home to England, so many vessels
sail that way, and that during bad weather (probably two months), if
I like I shall be left in some healthy, safe and nice country; that I
shall always have assistance; that he has many books, all instruments,
guns, at my service; that the fewer and cheaper clothes I take the
better. The manner of proceeding will just suit me. They anchor the
ship, and then remain for a fortnight at a place. I have made Captain
Beaufort perfectly understand me. He says if I start and do not go round
the world, I shall have good reason to think myself deceived. I am to
call the day after to-morrow, and, if possible, to receive more certain
instructions. The want of room is decidedly the most serious objection;
but Captain Fitz-Roy (probably owing to Wood's letter) seems determined
to make me [as] comfortable as he possibly can. I like his manner of
proceeding. He asked me at once, "Shall you bear being told that I want
the cabin to myself--when I want to be alone? If we treat each other
this way, I hope we shall suit; if not, probably we should wish each
other at the devil."

We stop a week at [the] Madeira Islands, and shall see most of [the]
big cities in South America. Captain Beaufort is drawing up the track
through the South Sea. I am writing in [a] great hurry; I do not know
whether you take interest enough to excuse treble postage. I hope I am
judging reasonably, and not through prejudice, about Captain Fitz-Roy;
if so, I am sure we shall suit. I dine with him to-day. I could write
[a] great deal more if I thought you liked it, and I had at present
time. There is indeed a tide in the affairs of man, and I have
experienced it, and I had ENTIRELY given it up till one to-day.

Love to my father. Dearest Susan, good-bye.

CH. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. London, Monday, [September 5, 1831].

My dear Sir,

Gloria in excelsis is the most moderate beginning I can think of.
Things are more prosperous than I should have thought possible. Captain
Fitz-Roy is everything that is delightful. If I was to praise half so
much as I feel inclined, you would say it was absurd, only once seeing
him. I think he really wishes to have me. He offers me to mess with him,
and he will take care I have such room as is possible. But about the
cases he says I must limit myself; but then he thinks like a sailor
about size. Captain Beaufort says I shall be upon the Boards, and then
it will only cost me like other officers. Ship sails 10th of October.
Spends a week at Madeira Islands; and then Rio de Janeiro. They all
think most extremely probable, home by the Indian archipelago; but till
that is decided, I will not be so.

What has induced Captain Fitz-Roy to take a better view of the case is,
that Mr. Chester, who was going as a friend, cannot go, so that I shall
have his place in every respect.

Captain Fitz-Roy has [a] good stock of books, many of which were in my
list, and rifles, etc., so that the outfit will be much less expensive
than I supposed.

The vessel will be out three years. I do not object so that my father
does not. On Wednesday I have another interview with Captain Beaufort,
and on Sunday most likely go with Captain Fitz-Roy to Plymouth. So I
hope you will keep on thinking on the subject, and just keep memoranda
of what may strike you. I will call most probably on Mr. Burchell and
introduce myself. I am in lodgings at 17 Spring Gardens. You cannot
imagine anything more pleasant, kind, and open than Captain Fitz-Roy's
manners were to me. I am sure it will be my fault if we do not suit.

What changes I have had. Till one to-day I was building castles in the
air about hunting foxes the Shropshire, now llamas in South America.

There is indeed a tide in the affairs of men. If you see Mr. Wood,
remember me very kindly to him.

Good-bye. My dear Henslow, Your most sincere friend, CHAS. DARWIN.

Excuse this letter in such a hurry.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. 17 Spring Gardens, London, September 6,
1831....

Your letter gave me great pleasure. You cannot imagine how much your
former letter annoyed and hurt me. (He had misunderstood a letter of
Fox's as implying a charge of falsehood.) But, thank heaven, I firmly
believe that it was my OWN ENTIRE fault in so interpreting your letter.
I lost a friend the other day, and I doubt whether the moral death (as
I then wickedly supposed) of our friendship did not grieve me as much as
the real and sudden death of poor Ramsay. We have known each other too
long to need, I trust, any more explanations. But I will mention just
one thing--that on my death-bed, I think I could say I never uttered one
insincere (which at the time I did not fully feel) expression about my
regard for you. One thing more--the sending IMMEDIATELY the insects, on
my honour, was an unfortunate coincidence. I forgot how you naturally
would take them. When you look at them now, I hope no unkindly feelings
will rise in your mind, and that you will believe that you have always
had in me a sincere, and I will add, an obliged friend. The very many
pleasant minutes that we spent together in Cambridge rose like departed
spirits in judgment against me. May we have many more such, will be one
of my last wishes in leaving England. God bless you, dear old Fox. May
you always be happy.

Yours truly, CHAS. DARWIN.

I have left your letter behind, so do not know whether I direct right.


CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS SUSAN DARWIN. 17 Spring Gardens, Tuesday,
[September 6, 1831.]

My dear Susan,

Again I am going to trouble you. I suspect, if I keep on at this rate,
you will sincerely wish me at Tierra del Fuego, or any other Terra, but
England. First I will give my commissions. Tell Nancy to make me
some twelve instead of eight shirts. Tell Edward to send me up in my
carpet-bag (he can slip the key in the bag tied to some string), my
slippers, a pair of lightish walking-shoes, my Spanish books, my new
microscope (about six inches long and three or four deep), which must
have cotton stuffed inside; my geological compass; my father knows
that; a little book, if I have got it in my bedroom--'Taxidermy.' Ask
my father if he thinks there would be any objection to my taking arsenic
for a little time, as my hands are not quite well, and I have always
observed that if I once get them well, and change my manner of living
about the same time, they will generally remain well. What is the dose?
Tell Edward my gun is dirty. What is Erasmus's direction? Tell me if you
think there is time to write and receive an answer before I start, as I
should like particularly to know what he thinks about it. I suppose you
do not know Sir J. Mackintosh's direction?

I write all this as if it was settled, but it is not more than it was,
excepting that from Captain Fitz-Roy wishing me so much to go, and from
his kindness, I feel a predestination I shall start. I spent a very
pleasant evening with him yesterday. He must be more than twenty-three
years old; he is of a slight figure, and a dark but handsome edition of
Mr. Kynaston, and, according to my notions, pre-eminently good manners.
He is all for economy, excepting on one point--viz., fire-arms. He
recommends me strongly to get a case of pistols like his, which cost 60
pounds!! and never to go on shore anywhere without loaded ones, and he
is doubting about a rifle; he says I cannot appreciate the luxury
of fresh meat here. Of course I shall buy nothing till everything is
settled; but I work all day long at my lists, putting in and striking
out articles. This is the first really cheerful day I have spent since
I received the letter, and it all is owing to the sort of involuntary
confidence I place in my beau ideal of a Captain.

We stop at Teneriffe. His object is to stop at as many places as
possible. He takes out twenty chronometers, and it will be a "sin" not
to settle the longitude. He tells me to get it down in writing at the
Admiralty that I have the free choice to leave as soon and whenever I
like. I dare say you expect I shall turn back at the Madeira; if I have
a morsel of stomach left, I won't give up. Excuse my so often troubling
and writing: the one is of great utility, the other a great amusement to
me. Most likely I shall write to-morrow. Answer by return of post. Love
to my father, dearest Susan.

C. DARWIN.

As my instruments want altering, send my things by the 'Oxonian' the
same night.


CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS SUSAN DARWIN. London, Friday Morning, September
9, 1831.

My dear Susan,

I have just received the parcel. I suppose it was not delivered
yesterday owing to the Coronation. I am very much obliged to my father,
and everybody else. Everything is done quite right. I suppose by this
time you have received my letter written next day, and I hope will send
off the things. My affairs remain in statu quo. Captain Beaufort says I
am on the books for victuals, and he thinks I shall have no difficulty
about my collections when I come home. But he is too deep a fish for me
to make him out. The only thing that now prevents me finally making up
my mind, is the want of certainty about the South Sea Islands; although
morally I have no doubt we should go there whether or no it is put in
the instructions. Captain Fitz-Roy says I do good by plaguing Captain
Beaufort, it stirs him up with a long pole. Captain Fitz-Roy says he is
sure he has interest enough (particularly if this Administration is not
everlasting--I shall soon turn Tory!), anyhow, even when out, to get
the ship ordered home by whatever track he likes. From what Wood says, I
presume the Dukes of Grafton and Richmond interest themselves about him.
By the way, Wood has been of the greatest use to me; and I am sure his
personal introduction of me inclined Captain Fitz-Roy to have me.

To explain things from the very beginning: Captain Fitz-Roy first wished
to have a Naturalist, and then he seems to have taken a sudden horror of
the chances of having somebody he should not like on board the vessel.
He confesses his letter to Cambridge was to throw cold water on the
scheme. I don't think we shall quarrel about politics, although Wood (as
might be expected from a Londonderry) solemnly warned Fitz-Roy that I
was a Whig. Captain Fitz-Roy was before Uncle Jos., he said, "now your
friends will tell you a sea-captain is the greatest brute on the face
of the creation. I do not know how to help you in this case, except by
hoping you will give me a trial." How one does change! I actually now
wish the voyage was longer before we touch land. I feel my blood run
cold at the quantity I have to do. Everybody seems ready to assist me.
The Zoological want to make me a corresponding member. All this I
can construct without crossing the Equator. But one friend is quite
invaluable, viz., a Mr. Yarrell, a stationer, and excellent naturalist.
(William Yarrell, well-known for his 'History of British Birds' and
'History of British Fishes,' was born in 1784. He inherited from his
father a newsagent's business, to which he steadily adhered up to his
death, "in his 73rd year." He was a man of a thoroughly amiable and
honourable character, and was a valued office-bearer of several of
the learned Societies.) He goes to the shops with me and bullies about
prices (not that I yet buy): hang me if I give 60 pounds for pistols.

Yesterday all the shops were shut, so that I could do nothing; and I was
child enough to give 1 pound 1 shilling for an excellent seat to see the
Procession. (The Coronation of William IV.) And it certainly was very
well worth seeing. I was surprised that any quantity of gold could make
a long row of people quite glitter. It was like only what one sees in
picture-books of Eastern processions. The King looked very well, and
seemed popular, but there was very little enthusiasm; so little that I
can hardly think there will be a coronation this time fifty years.

The Life Guards pleased me as much as anything--they are quite
magnificent; and it is beautiful to see them clear a crowd. You think
that they must kill a score at least, and apparently they really hurt
nobody, but most deucedly frighten them. Whenever a crowd was so dense
that the people were forced off the causeway, one of these six-feet
gentlemen, on a black horse, rode straight at the place, making his
horse rear very high, and fall on the thickest spot. You would suppose
men were made of sponge to see them shrink away.

In the evening there was an illumination, and much grander than the one
on the Reform Bill. All the principal streets were crowded just like a
race-ground. Carriages generally being six abreast, and I will venture
to say not going one mile an hour. The Duke of Northumberland learnt a
lesson last time, for his house was very grand; much more so than the
other great nobility, and in much better taste; every window in his
house was full of straight lines of brilliant lights, and from their
extreme regularity and number had a beautiful effect. The paucity of
invention was very striking, crowns, anchors, and "W.R.'s" were repeated
in endless succession. The prettiest were gas-pipes with small holes;
they were almost painfully brilliant. I have written so much about the
Coronation, that I think you will have no occasion to read the "Morning
Herald".

For about the first time in my life I find London very pleasant; hurry,
bustle, and noise are all in unison with my feelings. And I have plenty
to do in spare moments. I work at Astronomy, as I suppose it would
astound a sailor if one did not know how to find Latitude and Longitude.
I am now going to Captain Fitz-Roy, and will keep [this] letter open
till evening for anything that may occur. I will give you one proof of
Fitz-Roy being a good officer--all the officers are the same as before;
two-thirds of his crew and [the] eight marines who went before all
offered to come again, so the service cannot be so very bad. The
Admiralty have just issued orders for a large stock of canister-meat
and lemon-juice, etc. etc. I have just returned from spending a long
day with Captain Fitz-Roy, driving about in his gig, and shopping. This
letter is too late for to-day's post. You may consider it settled that I
go. Yet there is room for change if any untoward accident should happen;
this I can see no reason to expect. I feel convinced nothing else will
alter my wish of going. I have begun to order things. I have procured a
case of good strong pistols and an excellent rifle for 50 pounds, there
is a saving; a good telescope, with compass, 5 pounds, and these are
nearly the only expensive instruments I shall want. Captain Fitz-Roy has
everything. I never saw so (what I should call, he says not) extravagant
a man, as regards himself, but as economical towards me. How he did
order things! His fire-arms will cost 400 pounds at least. I found the
carpet bag when I arrived all right, and much obliged. I do not think
I shall take any arsenic; shall send partridges to Mr. Yarrell; much
obliged. Ask Edward to BARGAIN WITH Clemson to make for my gun--TWO
SPARE hammers or cocks, two main-springs, two sere-springs, four nipples
or plugs--I mean one for each barrel, except nipples, of which there
must be two for each, all of excellent quality, and set about them
immediately; tell Edward to make inquiries about prices. I go on Sunday
per packet to Plymouth, shall stay one or two days, then return, and
hope to find a letter from you; a few days in London; then Cambridge,
Shrewsbury, London, Plymouth, Madeira, is my route. It is a great bore
my writing so much about the Coronation; I could fill another sheet.
I have just been with Captain King, Fitz-Roy's senior officer last
expedition; he thinks that the expedition will suit me. Unasked, he
said Fitz-Roy's temper was perfect. He sends his own son with him
as midshipman. The key of my microscope was forgotten; it is of no
consequence. Love to all.

CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. 17 Spring Gardens (and here I shall remain
till I start) [September 19, 1831].

My dear Fox,

I returned from my expedition to see the "Beagle" at Plymouth on
Saturday, and found your most welcome letter on my table. It is quite
ridiculous what a very long period these last twenty days have appeared
to me, certainly much more than as many weeks on ordinary occasions;
this will account for my not recollecting how much I told you of my
plans....

But on the whole it is a grand and fortunate opportunity; there will be
so many things to interest me--fine scenery and an endless occupation
and amusement in the different branches of Natural History; then again
navigation and meteorology will amuse me on the voyage, joined to the
grand requisite of there being a pleasant set of officers, and, as
far as I can judge, this is certain. On the other hand there is very
considerable risk to one's life and health, and the leaving for so very
long a time so many people whom I dearly love, is oftentimes a feeling
so painful that it requires all my resolution to overcome it. But
everything is now settled, and before the 20th of October I trust to
be on the broad sea. My objection to the vessel is its smallness, which
cramps one so for room for packing my own body and all my cases, etc.,
etc. As to its safety, I hope the Admiralty are the best judges; to a
landsman's eye she looks very small. She is a ten-gun three-masted brig,
but, I believe, an excellent vessel. So much for my future plans, and
now for my present. I go to-night by the mail to Cambridge, and from
thence, after settling my affairs, proceed to Shrewsbury (most likely on
Friday 23rd, or perhaps before); there I shall stay a few days, and be
in London by the 1st of October, and start for Plymouth on the 9th.

And now for the principal part of my letter. I do not know how to tell
you how very kind I feel your offer of coming to see me before I
leave England. Indeed I should like it very much; but I must tell you
decidedly that I shall have very little time to spare, and that little
time will be almost spoilt by my having so much to think about; and
secondly, I can hardly think it worth your while to leave your parish
for such a cause. But I shall never forget such generous kindness. Now
I know you will act just as you think right; but do not come up for my
sake. Any time is the same for me. I think from this letter you will
know as much of my plans as I do myself, and will judge accordingly
the where and when to write to me. Every now and then I have moments of
glorious enthusiasm, when I think of the date and cocoa-trees, the palms
and ferns so lofty and beautiful, everything new, everything sublime.
And if I live to see years in after life, how grand must such
recollections be! Do you know Humboldt? (If you don't, do so directly.)
With what intense pleasure he appears always to look back on the days
spent in the tropical countries. I hope when you next write to Osmaston,
[you will] tell them my scheme, and give them my kindest regards and
farewells.

Good-bye, my dear Fox, Yours ever sincerely, CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO R. FITZ-ROY. 17 Spring Gardens [October 17? 1831].

Dear Fitz-Roy,

Very many thanks for your letter; it has made me most comfortable, for
it would have been heart-breaking to have left anything quite behind,
and I never should have thought of sending things by some other vessel.
This letter will, I trust, accompany some talc. I read your letter
without attending to the name. But I have now procured some from Jones,
which appears very good, and I will send it this evening by the mail.
You will be surprised at not seeing me propria persona instead of my
handwriting. But I had just found out that the large steam-packet did
not intend to sail on Sunday, and I was picturing to myself a small,
dirty cabin, with the proportion of 39-40ths of the passengers very
sick, when Mr. Earl came in and told me the "Beagle" would not sail till
the beginning of November. This, of course, settled the point; so that I
remain in London one week more. I shall then send heavy goods by steamer
and start myself by the coach on Sunday evening.

Have you a good set of mountain barometers? Several great guns in the
scientific world have told me some points in geology to ascertain which
entirely depend on their relative height. If you have not a good stock,
I will add one more to the list. I ought to be ashamed to trouble you so
much, but will you SEND ONE LINE to inform me? I am daily becoming more
anxious to be off, and, if I am so, you must be in a perfect fever. What
a glorious day the 4th of November will be to me! My second life will
then commence, and it shall be as a birthday for the rest of my life.

Believe me, dear Fitz-Roy, Yours most sincerely, CHAS. DARWIN.

MONDAY.--I hope I have not put you to much inconvenience by ordering the
room in readiness.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Devonport, November 15, 1831.

My dear Henslow,

The orders are come down from the Admiralty, and everything is finally
settled. We positively sail the last day of this month, and I think
before that time the vessel will be ready. She looks most beautiful,
even a landsman must admire her. WE all think her the most perfect
vessel ever turned out of the Dockyard. One thing is certain, no vessel
has been fitted out so expensively, and with so much care. Everything
that can be made so is of mahogany, and nothing can exceed the neatness
and beauty of all the accommodations. The instructions are very general,
and leave a great deal to the Captain's discretion and judgment, paying
a substantial as well as a verbal compliment to him....

No vessel ever left England with such a set of Chronometers, viz.,
twenty-four, all very good ones. In short, everything is well, and I
have only now to pray for the sickness to moderate its fierceness, and
I shall do very well. Yet I should not call it one of the very best
opportunities for natural history that has ever occurred. The absolute
want of room is an evil that nothing can surmount. I think L. Jenyns did
very wisely in not coming, that is judging from my own feelings, for I
am sure if I had left college some few years, or been those years older,
I NEVER could have endured it. The officers (excepting the Captain) are
like the freshest freshmen, that is in their manners, in everything else
widely different. Remember me most kindly to him, and tell him if ever
he dreams in the night of palm-trees, he may in the morning comfort
himself with the assurance that the voyage would not have suited him.

I am much obliged for your advice, de Mathematicis. I suspect when I am
struggling with a triangle, I shall often wish myself in your room, and
as for those wicked sulky surds, I do not know what I shall do without
you to conjure them. My time passes away very pleasantly. I know one
or two pleasant people, foremost of whom is Mr. Thunder-and-lightning
Harris (William Snow Harris, the Electrician.), whom I dare say you have
heard of. My chief employment is to go on board the "Beagle", and try to
look as much like a sailor as I can. I have no evidence of having taken
in man, woman or child.

I am going to ask you to do one more commission, and I trust it will
be the last. When I was in Cambridge, I wrote to Mr. Ash, asking him to
send my College account to my father, after having subtracted about 30
pounds for my furniture. This he has forgotten to do, and my father has
paid the bill, and I want to have the furniture-money transmitted to
my father. Perhaps you would be kind enough to speak to Mr. Ash. I have
cost my father so much money, I am quite ashamed of myself.

I will write once again before sailing, and perhaps you will write to me
before then.

Remember me to Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Peacock.

Believe me, yours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Devonport, December 3, 1831.

My dear Henslow,

It is now late in the evening, and to-night I am going to sleep on
board. On Monday we most certainly sail, so you may guess what a
desperate state of confusion we are all in. If you were to hear the
various exclamations of the officers, you would suppose we had scarcely
had a week's notice. I am just in the same way taken all ABACK, and in
such a bustle I hardly know what to do. The number of things to be done
is infinite. I look forward even to sea-sickness with something like
satisfaction, anything must be better than this state of anxiety. I am
very much obliged for your last kind and affectionate letter. I always
like advice from you, and no one whom I have the luck to know is more
capable of giving it than yourself. Recollect, when you write, that I am
a sort of protege of yours, and that it is your bounden duty to lecture
me.

I will now give you my direction; it is at first, Rio; but if you
will send me a letter on the first Tuesday (when the packet sails) in
February, directed to Monte Video, it will give me very great pleasure;
I shall so much enjoy hearing a little Cambridge news. Poor dear old
Alma Mater! I am a very worthy son in as far as affection goes. I have
little more to write about...I cannot end this without telling you how
cordially I feel grateful for the kindness you have shown me during
my Cambridge life. Much of the pleasure and utility which I may have
derived from it is owing to you. I long for the time when we shall again
meet, and till then believe me, my dear Henslow,

Your affectionate and obliged friend, CH. DARWIN.

Remember me most kindly to those who take any interest in me.




CHAPTER 1.VI. -- THE VOYAGE.

"There is a natural good-humoured energy in his letters just like
himself."--From a letter of Dr. R.W. Darwin's to Prof. Henslow.

[The object of the "Beagle" voyage is briefly described in my father's
'Journal of Researches,' page 1, as being "to complete the Survey of
Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, commenced under Captain King in 1826
to 1830; to survey the shores of Chile, Peru, and some island in the
Pacific; and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the
world."]

The "Beagle" is described as a well-built little vessel, of 235 tons,
rigged as a barque, and carrying six guns. She belonged to the old class
of ten-gun brigs, which were nicknamed "coffins," from their liability
to go down in severe weather. They were very "deep-waisted," that is,
their bulwarks were high in proportion to their size, so that a heavy
sea breaking over them might be highly dangerous. Nevertheless, she
lived through the five years' work, in the most stormy regions in the
world, under Commanders Stokes and Fitz-Roy, without a serious accident.
When re-commissioned in 1831 for her second voyage, she was found (as
I learn from Admiral Sir James Sulivan) to be so rotten that she had
practically to be rebuilt, and it was this that caused the long delay
in refitting. The upper deck was raised, making her much safer in heavy
weather, and giving her far more comfortable accommodation below. By
these alterations and by the strong sheathing added to her bottom
she was brought up to 242 tons burthen. It is a proof of the splendid
seamanship of Captain Fitz-Roy and his officers that she returned
without having carried away a spar, and that in only one of the heavy
storms that she encountered was she in great danger.

She was fitted out for the expedition with all possible care, being
supplied with carefully chosen spars and ropes, six boats, and a
"dinghy;" lightning conductors, "invented by Mr. Harris, were fixed in
all the masts, the bowsprits, and even in the flying jib-boom." To quote
my father's description, written from Devonport, November 17, 1831:
"Everybody, who can judge, says it is one of the grandest voyages
that has almost ever been sent out. Everything is on a grand scale.
Twenty-four chronometers. The whole ship is fitted up with mahogany;
she is the admiration of the whole place. In short, everything is as
prosperous as human means can make it."

Owing to the smallness of the vessel, every one on board was cramped for
room, and my father's accommodation seems to have been small enough: "I
have just room to turn round," he writes to Henslow, "and that is all."
Admiral Sir James Sulivan writes to me: "The narrow space at the end of
the chart-table was his only accommodation for working, dressing, and
sleeping; the hammock being left hanging over his head by day, when the
sea was at all rough, that he might lie on it with a book in his hand
when he could not any longer sit at the table. His only stowage for
clothes being several small drawers in the corner, reaching from deck to
deck; the top one being taken out when the hammock was hung up, without
which there was not length for it, so then the foot-clews took the place
of the top drawer. For specimens he had a very small cabin under the
forecastle."

Yet of this narrow room he wrote enthusiastically, September 17, 1831:--

"When I wrote last I was in great alarm about my cabin. The cabins were
not then marked out, but when I left they were, and mine is a capital
one, certainly next best to the Captain's and remarkably light. My
companion most luckily, I think, will turn out to be the officer whom I
shall like best. Captain Fitz-Roy says he will take care that one corner
is so fitted up that I shall be comfortable in it and shall consider
it my home, but that also I shall have the run of his. My cabin is the
drawing one; and in the middle is a large table, on which we two sleep
in hammocks. But for the first two months there will be no drawing to
be done, so that it will be quite a luxurious room, and good deal larger
than the Captain's cabin."

My father used to say that it was the absolute necessity of tidiness
in the cramped space of the "Beagle" that helped 'to give him his
methodical habits of working.' On the "Beagle", too, he would say, that
he learned what he considered the golden rule for saving time; i.e.,
taking care of the minutes.

Sir James Sulivan tells me that the chief fault in the outfit of the
expedition was the want of a second smaller vessel to act as tender.
This want was so much felt by Captain Fitz-Roy that he hired two decked
boats to survey the coast of Patagonia, at a cost of 1100 pounds, a sum
which he had to supply, although the boats saved several thousand pounds
to the country. He afterwards bought a schooner to act as a tender, thus
saving the country a further large amount. He was ultimately ordered to
sell the schooner, and was compelled to bear the loss himself, and it
was only after his death that some inadequate compensation was made for
all the losses which he suffered through his zeal.

For want of a proper tender, much of the work had to be done in small
open whale boats, which were sent away from the ship for weeks together,
and this in a climate, where the crews were exposed to severe hardships
from the almost constant rains, which sometimes continued for weeks
together. The completeness of the equipment was also in other respects
largely due to the public spirit of Captain Fitz-Roy. He provided at
his own cost an artist, and a skilled instrument-maker to look after
the chronometers. (Either one or both were on the books for victuals.)
Captain Fitz-Roy's wish was to take "some well-educated and scientific
person" as his private guest, but this generous offer was only accepted
by my father on condition of being allowed to pay a fair share of the
expense of the Captain's table; he was, moreover, on the ship's books
for victuals.

In a letter to his sister (July 1832) he writes contentedly of his
manner of life at sea:--"I do not think I have ever given you an account
of how the day passes. We breakfast at eight o'clock. The invariable
maxim is to throw away all politeness--that is, never to wait for each
other, and bolt off the minute one has done eating, etc. At sea, when
the weather is calm, I work at marine animals, with which the whole
ocean abounds. If there is any sea up I am either sick or contrive to
read some voyage or travels. At one we dine. You shore-going people are
lamentably mistaken about the manner of living on board. We have never
yet (nor shall we) dined off salt meat. Rice and peas and calavanses are
excellent vegetables, and, with good bread, who could want more? Judge
Alderson could not be more temperate, as nothing but water comes on the
table. At five we have tea. The midshipmen's berth have all their meals
an hour before us, and the gun-room an hour afterwards."

The crew of the "Beagle" consisted of Captain Fitz-Roy, "Commander and
Surveyor," two lieutenants, one of whom (the first lieutenant) was the
late Captain Wickham, Governor of Queensland; the present Admiral Sir
James Sulivan, K.C.B., was the second lieutenant. Besides the master
and two mates, there was an assistant-surveyor, the present Admiral Lort
Stokes. There were also a surgeon, assistant-surgeon, two midshipmen,
master's mate, a volunteer (1st class), purser, carpenter, clerk,
boatswain, eight marines, thirty-four seamen, and six boys.

There are not now (1882) many survivors of my father's old ship-mates.
Admiral Mellersh, Mr. Hammond, and Mr. Philip King, of the Legislative
Council of Sydney, and Mr. Usborne, are among the number. Admiral
Johnson died almost at the same time as my father.

He retained to the last a most pleasant recollection of the voyage of
the "Beagle", and of the friends he made on board her. To his children
their names were familiar, from his many stories of the voyage, and we
caught his feeling of friendship for many who were to us nothing more
than names.

It is pleasant to know how affectionately his old companions remembered
him.

Sir James Sulivan remained, throughout my father's lifetime, one of
his best and truest friends. He writes:--"I can confidently express my
belief that during the five years in the "Beagle", he was never known to
be out of temper, or to say one unkind or hasty word OF or TO any
one. You will therefore readily understand how this, combined with the
admiration of his energy and ability, led to our giving him the name of
'the dear old Philosopher.'" (His other nickname was "The Flycatcher." I
have heard my father tell how he overheard the boatswain of the "Beagle"
showing another boatswain over the ship, and pointing out the
officers: "That's our first lieutenant; that's our doctor; that's our
flycatcher.") Admiral Mellersh writes to me:--"Your father is as vividly
in my mind's eye as if it was only a week ago that I was in the "Beagle"
with him; his genial smile and conversation can never be forgotten by
any who saw them and heard them. I was sent on two or three occasions
away in a boat with him on some of his scientific excursions, and always
looked forward to these trips with great pleasure, an anticipation that,
unlike many others, was always realised. I think he was the only man
I ever knew against whom I never heard a word said; and as people when
shut up in a ship for five years are apt to get cross with each other,
that is saying a good deal. Certainly we were always so hard at work, we
had no time to quarrel, but if we had done so, I feel sure your father
would have tried (and have been successful) to throw oil on the troubled
waters."

Admiral Stokes, Mr. King, Mr. Usborne, and Mr. Hamond, all speak of
their friendship with him in the same warm-hearted way.

Of the life on board and on shore his letters give some idea. Captain
Fitz-Roy was a strict officer, and made himself thoroughly respected
both by officers and men. The occasional severity of his manner was
borne with because every one on board knew that his first thought was
his duty, and that he would sacrifice anything to the real welfare
of the ship. My father writes, July 1834, "We all jog on very well
together, there is no quarrelling on board, which is something to say.
The Captain keeps all smooth by rowing every one in turn." The best
proof that Fitz-Roy was valued as a commander is given by the fact that
many ('Voyage of the "Adventure" and "Beagle",' vol. ii. page 21.) of
the crew had sailed with him in the "Beagle's" former voyage, and there
were a few officers as well as seamen and marines, who had served in the
"Adventure" or "Beagle" during the whole of that expedition.

My father speaks of the officers as a fine determined set of men, and
especially of Wickham, the first lieutenant, as a "glorious fellow." The
latter being responsible for the smartness and appearance of the ship
strongly objected to his littering the decks, and spoke of specimens as
"d--d beastly devilment," and used to add, "If I were skipper, I would
soon have you and all your d--d mess out of the place."

A sort of halo of sanctity was given to my father by the fact of his
dining in the Captain's cabin, so that the midshipmen used at first to
call him "Sir," a formality, however, which did not prevent his becoming
fast friends with the younger officers. He wrote about the year 1861
or 1862 to Mr. P.G. King, M.L.C., Sydney, who, as before stated, was a
midshipman on board the "Beagle":--"The remembrance of old days, when we
used to sit and talk on the booms of the "Beagle", will always, to the
day of my death, make me glad to hear of your happiness and prosperity."
Mr. King describes the pleasure my father seemed to take "in pointing
out to me as a youngster the delights of the tropical nights, with their
balmy breezes eddying out of the sails above us, and the sea lighted
up by the passage of the ship through the never-ending streams of
phosphorescent animalculae."

It has been assumed that his ill-health in later years was due to his
having suffered so much from sea-sickness. This he did not himself
believe, but rather ascribed his bad health to the hereditary fault
which came out as gout in some of the past generations. I am not
quite clear as to how much he actually suffered from sea-sickness; my
impression is distinct that, according to his own memory, he was not
actually ill after the first three weeks, but constantly uncomfortable
when the vessel pitched at all heavily. But, judging from his letters,
and from the evidence of some of the officers, it would seem that
in later years he forgot the extent of the discomfort from which he
suffered. Writing June 3, 1836, from the Cape of Good Hope, he says: "It
is a lucky thing for me that the voyage is drawing to its close, for
I positively suffer more from sea-sickness now than three years ago."
Admiral Lort Stokes wrote to the "Times", April 25, 1883:--

"May I beg a corner for my feeble testimony to the marvellous
persevering endurance in the cause of science of that great naturalist,
my old and lost friend, Mr. Charles Darwin, whose remains are so very
justly to be honoured with a resting-place in Westminster Abbey?

"Perhaps no one can better testify to his early and most trying labours
than myself. We worked together for several years at the same table in
the poop cabin of the 'Beagle' during her celebrated voyage, he with his
microscope and myself at the charts. It was often a very lively end of
the little craft, and distressingly so to my old friend, who suffered
greatly from sea-sickness. After perhaps an hour's work he would say to
me, 'Old fellow, I must take the horizontal for it,' that being the best
relief position from ship motion; a stretch out on one side of the table
for some time would enable him to resume his labours for a while, when
he had again to lie down.

"It was distressing to witness this early sacrifice of Mr. Darwin's
health, who ever afterwards seriously felt the ill-effects of the
'Beagle's' voyage."

Mr. A.B. Usborne writes, "He was a dreadful sufferer from sea-sickness,
and at times, when I have been officer of the watch, and reduced the
sails, making the ship more easy, and thus relieving him, I have been
pronounced by him to be 'a good officer,' and he would resume his
microscopic observations in the poop cabin." The amount of work that he
got through on the "Beagle" shows that he was habitually in full vigour;
he had, however, one severe illness, in South America, when he was
received into the house of an Englishman, Mr. Corfield, who tended him
with careful kindness. I have heard him say that in this illness every
secretion of the body was affected, and that when he described the
symptoms to his father Dr. Darwin could make no guess as to the nature
of the disease. My father was sometimes inclined to think that the
breaking up of his health was to some extent due to this attack.

The "Beagle" letters give ample proof of his strong love of home, and
all connected with it, from his father down to Nancy, his old nurse, to
whom he sometimes sends his love.

His delight in home-letters is shown in such passages as:--"But if you
knew the glowing, unspeakable delight, which I felt at being certain
that my father and all of you were well, only four months ago, you would
not grudge the labour lost in keeping up the regular series of letters."

Or again--his longing to return in words like these:--"It is too
delightful to think that I shall see the leaves fall and hear the robin
sing next autumn at Shrewsbury. My feelings are those of a schoolboy to
the smallest point; I doubt whether ever boy longed for his holidays as
much as I do to see you all again. I am at present, although nearly half
the world is between me and home, beginning to arrange what I shall do,
where I shall go during the first week."

Another feature in his letters is the surprise and delight with which
he hears of his collections and observations being of some use. It seems
only to have gradually occurred to him that he would ever be more than
collector of specimens and facts, of which the great men were to make
use. And even as to the value of his collections he seems to have had
much doubt, for he wrote to Henslow in 1834:--"I really began to think
that my collections were so poor that you were puzzled what to say; the
case is now quite on the opposite tack, for you are guilty of exciting
all my vain feelings to a most comfortable pitch; if hard work will
atone for these thoughts, I vow it shall not be spared."

After his return and settlement in London, he began to realise the value
of what he had done, and wrote to Captain Fitz-Roy--"However others
may look back to the 'Beagle's' voyage, now that the small disagreeable
parts are well-nigh forgotten, I think it far the MOST FORTUNATE
CIRCUMSTANCE IN MY LIFE that the chance afforded by your offer of taking
a Naturalist fell on me. I often have the most vivid and delightful
pictures of what I saw on board the 'Beagle' pass before my eyes.
These recollections, and what I learnt on Natural History, I would not
exchange for twice ten thousand a year."

[In selecting the following series of letters, I have been guided by the
wish to give as much personal detail as possible. I have given only a
few scientific letters, to illustrate the way in which he worked, and
how he regarded his own results. In his 'Journal of Researches' he gives
incidentally some idea of his personal character; the letters given in
the present chapter serve to amplify in fresher and more spontaneous
words that impression of his personality which the 'Journal' has given
to so many readers.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO R.W. DARWIN. Bahia, or San Salvador, Brazils [February
8, 1832].

I find after the first page I have been writing to my sisters.

My dear Father,

I am writing this on the 8th of February, one day's sail past St.
Jago (Cape de Verd), and intend taking the chance of meeting with a
homeward-bound vessel somewhere about the equator. The date, however,
will tell this whenever the opportunity occurs. I will now begin from
the day of leaving England, and give a short account of our progress.
We sailed, as you know, on the 27th of December, and have been fortunate
enough to have had from that time to the present a fair and moderate
breeze. It afterwards proved that we had escaped a heavy gale in the
Channel, another at Madeira, and another on [the] Coast of Africa. But
in escaping the gale, we felt its consequences--a heavy sea. In the
Bay of Biscay there was a long and continuous swell, and the misery
I endured from sea-sickness is far beyond what I ever guessed at. I
believe you are curious about it. I will give you all my dear-bought
experience. Nobody who has only been to sea for twenty-four hours has
a right to say that sea-sickness is even uncomfortable. The real misery
only begins when you are so exhausted that a little exertion makes a
feeling of faintness come on. I found nothing but lying in my hammock
did me any good. I must especially except your receipt of raisins, which
is the only food that the stomach will bear.

On the 4th of January we were not many miles from Madeira, but as there
was a heavy sea running, and the island lay to windward, it was not
thought worth while to beat up to it. It afterwards has turned out it
was lucky we saved ourselves the trouble. I was much too sick even to
get up to see the distant outline. On the 6th, in the evening, we sailed
into the harbour of Santa Cruz. I now first felt even moderately well,
and I was picturing to myself all the delights of fresh fruits growing
in beautiful valleys, and reading Humboldt's descriptions of the
island's glorious views, when perhaps you may nearly guess at our
disappointment, when a small pale man informed us we must perform a
strict quarantine of twelve days. There was a death-like stillness in
the ship till the Captain cried "up jib," and we left this long-wished
for place.

We were becalmed for a day between Teneriffe and the Grand Canary, and
here I first experienced any enjoyment. The view was glorious. The Peak
of Teneriffe was seen amongst the clouds like another world. Our only
drawback was the extreme wish of visiting this glorious island. TELL
EYTON NEVER TO FORGET EITHER THE CANARY ISLANDS OR SOUTH AMERICA; that I
am sure it will well repay the necessary trouble, but that he must make
up his mind to find a good deal of the latter. I feel certain he will
regret it if he does not make the attempt. From Teneriffe to St. Jago
the voyage was extremely pleasant. I had a net astern the vessel which
caught great numbers of curious animals, and fully occupied my time in
my cabin, and on deck the weather was so delightful and clear, that the
sky and water together made a picture. On the 16th we arrived at
Port Praya, the capital of the Cape de Verds, and there we remained
twenty-three days, viz., till yesterday, the 7th of February. The time
has flown away most delightfully, indeed nothing can be pleasanter;
exceedingly busy, and that business both a duty and a great delight. I
do not believe I have spent one half-hour idly since leaving Teneriffe.
St. Jago has afforded me an exceedingly rich harvest in several branches
of Natural History. I find the descriptions scarcely worth anything
of many of the commoner animals that inhabit the Tropics. I allude, of
course, to those of the lower classes.

Geologising in a volcanic country is most delightful; besides the
interest attached to itself, it leads you into most beautiful and
retired spots. Nobody but a person fond of Natural History can imagine
the pleasure of strolling under cocoa-nuts in a thicket of bananas and
coffee-plants, and an endless number of wild flowers. And this island,
that has given me so much instruction and delight, is reckoned the most
uninteresting place that we perhaps shall touch at during our voyage. It
certainly is generally very barren, but the valleys are more exquisitely
beautiful, from the very contrast. It is utterly useless to say anything
about the scenery; it would be as profitable to explain to a blind
man colours, as to a person who has not been out of Europe, the total
dissimilarity of a tropical view. Whenever I enjoy anything, I always
either look forward to writing it down, either in my log-book (which
increases in bulk), or in a letter; so you must excuse raptures, and
those raptures badly expressed. I find my collections are increasing
wonderfully, and from Rio I think I shall be obliged to send a cargo
home.

All the endless delays which we experienced at Plymouth have been most
fortunate, as I verily believe no person ever went out better provided
for collecting and observing in the different branches of Natural
History. In a multitude of counsellors I certainly found good. I find to
my great surprise that a ship is singularly comfortable for all sorts
of work. Everything is so close at hand, and being cramped makes one so
methodical, that in the end I have been a gainer. I already have got to
look at going to sea as a regular quiet place, like going back to home
after staying away from it. In short, I find a ship a very comfortable
house, with everything you want, and if it was not for sea-sickness the
whole world would be sailors. I do not think there is much danger of
Erasmus setting the example, but in case there should be, he may rely
upon it he does not know one-tenth of the sufferings of sea-sickness.

I like the officers much more than I did at first, especially Wickham,
and young King and Stokes, and indeed all of them. The Captain continues
steadily very kind, and does everything in his power to assist me. We
see very little of each other when in harbour, our pursuits lead us
in such different tracks. I never in my life met with a man who could
endure nearly so great a share of fatigue. He works incessantly, and
when apparently not employed, he is thinking. If he does not kill
himself, he will during this voyage do a wonderful quantity of work.
I find I am very well, and stand the little heat we have had as yet
as well as anybody. We shall soon have it in real earnest. We are now
sailing for Fernando Noronha, off the coast of Brazil, where we shall
not stay very long, and then examine the shoals between there and Rio,
touching perhaps at Bahia. I will finish this letter when an opportunity
of sending it occurs.

FEBRUARY 26TH.

About 280 miles from Bahia. On the 10th we spoke the packet "Lyra", on
her voyage to Rio. I sent a short letter by her, to be sent to England
on [the] first opportunity. We have been singularly unlucky in not
meeting with any homeward-bound vessels, but I suppose [at] Bahia we
certainly shall be able to write to England. Since writing the first
part of [this] letter nothing has occurred except crossing the Equator,
and being shaved. This most disagreeable operation consists in having
your face rubbed with paint and tar, which forms a lather for a saw
which represents the razor, and then being half drowned in a sail filled
with salt water. About 50 miles north of the line we touched at the
rocks of St. Paul; this little speck (about 1/4 of a mile across) in the
Atlantic has seldom been visited. It is totally barren, but is covered
by hosts of birds; they were so unused to men that we found we could
kill plenty with stones and sticks. After remaining some hours on the
island, we returned on board with the boat loaded with our prey. From
this we went to Fernando Noronha, a small island where the [Brazilians]
send their exiles. The landing there was attended with so much
difficulty owing [to] a heavy surf that the Captain determined to
sail the next day after arriving. My one day on shore was exceedingly
interesting, the whole island is one single wood so matted together by
creepers that it is very difficult to move out of the beaten path.
I find the Natural History of all these unfrequented spots most
exceedingly interesting, especially the geology. I have written this
much in order to save time at Bahia.

Decidedly the most striking thing in the Tropics is the novelty of the
vegetable forms. Cocoa-nuts could well be imagined from drawings, if
you add to them a graceful lightness which no European tree partakes of.
Bananas and plantains are exactly the same as those in hothouses, the
acacias or tamarinds are striking from the blueness of their foliage;
but of the glorious orange trees, no description, no drawings, will give
any just idea; instead of the sickly green of our oranges, the native
ones exceed the Portugal laurel in the darkness of their tint, and
infinitely exceed it in beauty of form. Cocoa-nuts, papaws, the light
green bananas, and oranges, loaded with fruit, generally surround the
more luxuriant villages. Whilst viewing such scenes, one feels the
impossibility that any description would come near the mark, much less
be overdrawn.

MARCH 1ST.

Bahia, or San Salvador. I arrived at this place on the 28th of February,
and am now writing this letter after having in real earnest strolled
in the forests of the new world. No person could imagine anything so
beautiful as the ancient town of Bahia, it is fairly embosomed in a
luxuriant wood of beautiful trees, and situated on a steep bank, and
overlooks the calm waters of the great bay of All Saints. The houses
are white and lofty, and, from the windows being narrow and long, have
a very light and elegant appearance. Convents, porticos, and public
buildings, vary the uniformity of the houses; the bay is scattered over
with large ships; in short, and what can be said more, it is one of
the finest views in the Brazils. But the exquisite glorious pleasure of
walking amongst such flowers, and such trees, cannot be comprehended
but by those who have experienced it. Although in so low a latitude the
locality is not disagreeably hot, but at present it is very damp, for it
is the rainy season. I find the climate as yet agrees admirably with me;
it makes me long to live quietly for some time in such a country. If
you really want to have [an idea] of tropical countries, study Humboldt.
Skip the scientific parts, and commence after leaving Teneriffe. My
feelings amount to admiration the more I read him. Tell Eyton (I find I
am writing to my sisters!) how exceedingly I enjoy America, and that I
am sure it will be a great pity if he does not make a start.

This letter will go on the 5th, and I am afraid will be some time before
it reaches you; it must be a warning how in other parts of the world you
may be a long time without hearing. A year might by accident thus pass.
About the 12th we start for Rio, but we remain some time on the way in
sounding the Albrolhos shoals. Tell Eyton as far as my experience goes
let him study Spanish, French, drawing, and Humboldt. I do sincerely
hope to hear of (if not to see him) in South America. I look forward to
the letters in Rio--till each one is acknowledged, mention its date in
the next.

We have beat all the ships in manoeuvring, so much so that the
commanding officer says, we need not follow his example; because we do
everything better than his great ship. I begin to take great interest in
naval points, more especially now, as I find they all say we are the No.
1 in South America. I suppose the Captain is a most excellent officer.
It was quite glorious to-day how we beat the "Samarang" in furling
sails. It is quite a new thing for a "sounding ship" to beat a regular
man-of-war; and yet the "Beagle" is not at all a particular ship.
Erasmus will clearly perceive it when he hears that in the night I have
actually sat down in the sacred precincts of the quarter deck. You must
excuse these queer letters, and recollect they are generally written in
the evening after my day's work. I take more pains over my log-book, so
that eventually you will have a good account of all the places I visit.
Hitherto the voyage has answered ADMIRABLY to me, and yet I am now more
fully aware of your wisdom in throwing cold water on the whole scheme;
the chances are so numerous of turning out quite the reverse; to such
an extent do I feel this, that if my advice was asked by any person on
a similar occasion, I should be very cautious in encouraging him. I have
not time to write to anybody else, so send to Maer to let them know,
that in the midst of the glorious tropical scenery, I do not forget how
instrumental they were in placing me there. I will not rapturise again,
but I give myself great credit in not being crazy out of pure delight.

Give my love to every soul at home, and to the Owens.

I think one's affections, like other good things, flourish and increase
in these tropical regions.

The conviction that I am walking in the New World is even yet marvellous
in my own eyes, and I dare say it is little less so to you, the
receiving a letter from a son of yours in such a quarter.

Believe me, my dear Father, Your most affectionate son, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Botofogo Bay, near Rio de Janeiro, May,
1832.

My dear Fox,

I have delayed writing to you and all my other friends till I arrived
here and had some little spare time. My mind has been, since leaving
England, in a perfect HURRICANE of delight and astonishment, and to this
hour scarcely a minute has passed in idleness...

At St. Jago my natural history and most delightful labours commenced.
During the three weeks I collected a host of marine animals, and enjoyed
many a good geological walk. Touching at some islands, we sailed to
Bahia, and from thence to Rio, where I have already been some weeks. My
collections go on admirably in almost every branch. As for insects, I
trust I shall send a host of undescribed species to England. I believe
they have no small ones in the collections, and here this morning I have
taken minute Hydropori, Noterus, Colymbetes, Hydrophilus, Hydrobius,
Gromius, etc., etc., as specimens of fresh-water beetles. I am entirely
occupied with land animals, as the beach is only sand. Spiders and the
adjoining tribes have perhaps given me, from their novelty, the most
pleasure. I think I have already taken several new genera.

But Geology carries the day: it is like the pleasure of gambling.
Speculating, on first arriving, what the rocks may be, I often mentally
cry out 3 to 1 tertiary against primitive; but the latter have hitherto
won all the bets. So much for the grand end of my voyage; in other
respects things are equally flourishing. My life, when at sea, is
so quiet, that to a person who can employ himself, nothing can be
pleasanter; the beauty of the sky and brilliancy of the ocean together
make a picture. But when on shore, and wandering in the sublime forests,
surrounded by views more gorgeous than even Claude ever imagined,
I enjoy a delight which none but those who have experienced it can
understand. If it is to be done, it must be by studying Humboldt. At our
ancient snug breakfasts, at Cambridge, I little thought that the wide
Atlantic would ever separate us; but it is a rare privilege that with
the body, the feelings and memory are not divided. On the contrary, the
pleasantest scenes in my life, many of which have been in Cambridge,
rise from the contrast of the present, the more vividly in my
imagination. Do you think any diamond beetle will ever give me so much
pleasure as our old friend crux major?... It is one of my most constant
amusements to draw pictures of the past; and in them I often see you
and poor little Fran. Oh, Lord, and then old Dash, poor thing! Do you
recollect how you all tormented me about his beautiful tail?

...Think when you are picking insects off a hawthorn-hedge on a fine May
day (wretchedly cold, I have no doubt), think of me collecting amongst
pine-apples and orange-trees; whilst staining your fingers with dirty
blackberries, think and be envious of ripe oranges. This is a proper
piece of bravado, for I would walk through many a mile of sleet, snow,
or rain to shake you by the hand. My dear old Fox, God bless you.
Believe me,

Yours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Rio de Janeiro, May 18, 1832.

My dear Henslow,...

Till arriving at Teneriffe (we did not touch at Madeira) I was scarcely
out of my hammock, and really suffered more than you can well imagine
from such a cause. At Santa Cruz, whilst looking amongst the clouds for
the Peak, and repeating to myself Humboldt's sublime descriptions, it
was announced we must perform twelve days' strict quarantine. We had
made a short passage, so "Up jib," and away for St. Jago. You will say
all this sounds very bad, and so it was; but from that to the present
time it has been nearly one scene of continual enjoyment. A net over the
stern kept me at full work till we arrived at St. Jago. Here we spent
three most delightful weeks. The geology was pre-eminently interesting,
and I believe quite new; there are some facts on a large scale of
upraised coast (which is an excellent epoch for all the volcanic rocks
to date from), that would interest Mr. Lyell.

One great source of perplexity to me is an utter ignorance whether I
note the right facts, and whether they are of sufficient importance to
interest others. In the one thing collecting I cannot go wrong. St. Jago
is singularly barren, and produces few plants or insects, so that my
hammer was my usual companion, and in its company most delightful
hours I spent. On the coast I collected many marine animals, chiefly
gasteropodous (I think some new). I examined pretty accurately a
Caryopyllia, and, if my eyes are not bewitched, former descriptions have
not the slightest resemblance to the animal. I took several specimens
of an Octopus which possessed a most marvellous power of changing
its colours, equalling any chameleon, and evidently accommodating the
changes to the colour of the ground which it passed over. Yellowish
green, dark brown, and red, were the prevailing colours; this
fact appears to be new, as far as I can find out. Geology and the
invertebrate animals will be my chief object of pursuit through the
whole voyage.

We then sailed for Bahia, and touched at the rock of St. Paul. This is a
serpentine formation. Is it not the only island in the Atlantic which
is not volcanic? We likewise stayed a few hours at Fernando Noronha; a
tremendous surf was running so that a boat was swamped, and the Captain
would not wait. I find my life on board when we are on blue water most
delightful, so very comfortable and quiet--it is almost impossible to
be idle, and that for me is saying a good deal. Nobody could possibly be
better fitted in every respect for collecting than I am; many cooks
have not spoiled the broth this time. Mr. Brown's little hints about
microscopes, etc., have been invaluable. I am well off in books, the
'Dictionnaire Classique' IS MOST USEFUL. If you should think of any
thing or book that would be useful to me, if you would write one line,
E. Darwin, Wyndham Club, St. James's Street, he will procure them, and
send them with some other things to Monte Video, which for the next year
will be my headquarters.

Touching at the Abrolhos, we arrived here on April 4th, when amongst
others I received your most kind letter. You may rely on it during the
evening I thought of the many most happy hours I have spent with you in
Cambridge. I am now living at Botofogo, a village about a league from
the city, and shall be able to remain a month longer. The "Beagle" has
gone back to Bahia, and will pick me up on its return. There is a most
important error in the longitude of South America, to settle which this
second trip has been undertaken. Our chronometers, at least sixteen
of them, are going superbly; none on record have ever gone at all like
them.

A few days after arriving I started on an expedition of 150 miles to Rio
Macao, which lasted eighteen days. Here I first saw a tropical forest in
all its sublime grander--nothing but the reality can give any idea how
wonderful, how magnificent the scene is. If I was to specify any one
thing I should give the pre-eminence to the host of parasitical plants.
Your engraving is exactly true, but underrates rather than exaggerates
the luxuriance. I never experienced such intense delight. I formerly
admired Humboldt, I now almost adore him; he alone gives any notion of
the feelings which are raised in the mind on first entering the Tropics.
I am now collecting fresh-water and land animals; if what was told me in
London is true, viz., that there are no small insects in the collections
from the Tropics, I tell Entomologists to look out and have their pens
ready for describing. I have taken as minute (if not more so) as in
England, Hydropori, Hygroti, Hydrobii, Pselaphi, Staphylini, Curculio,
etc. etc. It is exceedingly interesting observing the difference of
genera and species from those which I know, it is however much less
than I had expected. I am at present red-hot with spiders; they are
very interesting, and if I am not mistaken I have already taken some
new genera. I shall have a large box to send very soon to Cambridge, and
with that I will mention some more natural history particulars.

The Captain does everything in his power to assist me, and we get on
very well, but I thank my better fortune he has not made me a renegade
to Whig principles. I would not be a Tory, if it was merely on account
of their cold hearts about that scandal to Christian nations--Slavery. I
am very good friends with all the officers.

I have just returned from a walk, and as a specimen, how little the
insects are known. Noterus, according to the 'Dictionary Classique,'
contains solely three European species. I in one haul of my net took
five distinct species; is this not quite extraordinary?...

Tell Professor Sedgwick he does not know how much I am indebted to him
for the Welsh Expedition; it has given me an interest in Geology which
I would not give up for any consideration. I do not think I ever spent
a more delightful three weeks than pounding the North-west Mountains. I
look forward to the geology about Monte Video as I hear there are slates
there, so I presume in that district I shall find the junctions of the
Pampas, and the enormous granite formation of Brazils. At Bahia the
pegmatite and gneiss in beds had the same direction, as observed by
Humboldt, prevailing over Columbia, distant 1300 miles--is it not
wonderful? Monte Video will be for a long time my direction. I hope
you will write again to me, there is nobody from whom I like receiving
advice so much as from you...Excuse this almost unintelligible letter,
and believe me, my dear Henslow, with the warmest feelings of respect
and friendship,

Yours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.M. HERBERT. Botofogo Bay, Rio de Janeiro, June 1832.

My dear old Herbert,

Your letter arrived here when I had given up all hopes of receiving
another, it gave me, therefore, an additional degree of pleasure. At
such an interval of time and space one does learn to feel truly obliged
to those who do not forget one. The memory when recalling scenes past
by, affords to us EXILES one of the greatest pleasures. Often and often
whilst wandering amongst these hills do I think of Barmouth, and, I may
add, as often wish for such a companion. What a contrast does a walk
in these two places afford; here abrupt and stony peaks are to the very
summit enclosed by luxuriant woods; the whole surface of the country,
excepting where cleared by man, is one impenetrable forest. How
different from Wales, with its sloping hills covered with turf, and
its open valleys. I was not previously aware how intimately what may be
called the moral part is connected with the enjoyment of scenery. I mean
such ideas, as the history of the country, the utility of the produce,
and more especially the happiness of the people living with them. Change
the English labourer into a poor slave, working for another, and you
will hardly recognise the same view. I am sure you will be glad to hear
how very well every part (Heaven forefend, except sea-sickness) of the
expedition has answered. We have already seen Teneriffe and the Great
Canary; St. Jago where I spent three most delightful weeks, revelling
in the delights of first naturalising a tropical volcanic island, and
besides other islands, the two celebrated ports in the Brazils, viz.
Bahia and Rio.

I was in my hammock till we arrived at the Canaries, and I shall never
forget the sublime impression the first view of Teneriffe made on
my mind. The first arriving into warm weather was most luxuriously
pleasant; the clear blue sky of the Tropics was no common change after
those accursed south-west gales at Plymouth. About the Line it became
weltering hot. We spent one day at St. Paul's, a little group of rocks
about a quarter of a mile in circumference, peeping up in the midst of
the Atlantic. There was such a scene here. Wickham (1st Lieutenant) and
I were the only two who landed with guns and geological hammers, etc.
The birds by myriads were too close to shoot; we then tried stones, but
at last, proh pudor! my geological hammer was the instrument of death.
We soon loaded the boat with birds and eggs. Whilst we were so engaged,
the men in the boat were fairly fighting with the sharks for such
magnificent fish as you could not see in the London market. Our boat
would have made a fine subject for Snyders, such a medley of game it
contained. We have been here ten weeks, and shall now start for Monte
Video, when I look forward to many a gallop over the Pampas. I am
ashamed of sending such a scrambling letter, but if you were to see the
heap of letters on my table you would understand the reason...

I am glad to hear music flourishes so well in Cambridge; but it [is] as
barbarous to talk to me of "celestial concerts" as to a person in Arabia
of cold water. In a voyage of this sort, if one gains many new and great
pleasures, on the other side the loss is not inconsiderable. How should
you like to be suddenly debarred from seeing every person and place,
which you have ever known and loved, for five years? I do assure you I
am occasionally "taken aback" by this reflection; and then for man or
ship it is not so easy to right again. Remember me most sincerely to the
remnant of most excellent fellows whom I have the good luck to know in
Cambridge--I mean Whitley and Watkins. Tell Lowe I am even beneath his
contempt. I can eat salt beef and musty biscuits for dinner. See what a
fall man may come to!

My direction for the next year and a half will be Monte Video.

God bless you, my very dear old Herbert. May you always be happy and
prosperous is my most cordial wish.

Yours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO F. WATKINS. Monte Video, River Plata, August 18, 1832.

My dear Watkins,

I do not feel very sure you will think a letter from one so far distant
will be worth having; I write therefore on the selfish principle of
getting an answer. In the different countries we visit the entire
newness and difference from England only serves to make more keen the
recollection of its scenes and delights. In consequence the pleasure of
thinking of, and hearing from one's former friends, does indeed become
great. Recollect this, and some long winter's evening sit down and send
me a long account of yourself and our friends; both what you have, and
what [you] intend doing; otherwise in three or four more years when I
return you will be all strangers to me. Considering how many months
have passed, we have not in the "Beagle" made much way round the world.
Hitherto everything has well repaid the necessary trouble and loss of
comfort. We stayed three weeks at the Cape de Verds; it was no ordinary
pleasure rambling over the plains of lava under a tropical sun, but when
I first entered on and beheld the luxuriant vegetation in Brazil, it
was realizing the visions in the 'Arabian Nights.' The brilliancy of the
scenery throws one into a delirium of delight, and a beetle hunter is
not likely soon to awaken from it, when whichever way he turns fresh
treasures meet his eye. At Rio de Janeiro three months passed away like
so many weeks. I made a most delightful excursion during this time of
150 miles into the country. I stayed at an estate which is the last of
the cleared ground, behind is one vast impenetrable forest. It is almost
impossible to imagine the quietude of such a life. Not a human being
within some miles interrupts the solitude. To seat oneself amidst the
gloom of such a forest on a decaying trunk, and then think of home, is a
pleasure worth taking some trouble for.

We are at present in a much less interesting country. One single walk
over the undulatory turf plain shows everything which is to be seen.
It is not at all unlike Cambridgeshire, only that every hedge, tree and
hill must be leveled, and arable land turned into pasture. All South
America is in such an unsettled state that we have not entered one port
without some sort of disturbance. At Buenos Ayres a shot came whistling
over our heads; it is a noise I had never before heard, but I found I
had an instinctive knowledge of what it meant. The other day we landed
our men here, and took possession, at the request of the inhabitants, of
the central fort. We philosophers do not bargain for this sort of work,
and I hope there will be no more. We sail in the course of a day or two
to survey the coast of Patagonia; as it is entirely unknown, I expect a
good deal of interest. But already do I perceive the grievous difference
between sailing on these seas and the Equinoctial ocean. In the "Ladies'
Gulf," as the Spaniard's call it, it is so luxurious to sit on deck and
enjoy the coolness of the night, and admire the new constellations of
the South...I wonder when we shall ever meet again; but be it when it
may, few things will give me greater pleasure than to see you again, and
talk over the long time we have passed together.

If you were to meet me at present I certainly should be looked at like a
wild beast, a great grizzly beard and flushing jacket would disfigure
an angel. Believe me, my dear Watkins, with the warmest feelings of
friendship.

Ever yours, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. April 11, 1833.

My dear Henslow,

We are now running up from the Falkland Islands to the Rio Negro (or
Colorado). The "Beagle" will proceed to Monte Video; but if it can be
managed I intend staying at the former place. It is now some months
since we have been at a civilised port; nearly all this time has been
spent in the most southern part of Tierra del Fuego. It is a detestable
place; gales succeed gales with such short intervals that it is
difficult to do anything. We were twenty-three days off Cape Horn, and
could by no means get to the westward. The last and final gale before we
gave up the attempt was unusually severe. A sea stove one of the boats,
and there was so much water on the decks that every place was afloat;
nearly all the paper for drying plants is spoiled, and half of this
curious collection.

We at last ran into harbour, and in the boats got to the west by the
inland channels. As I was one of this party I was very glad of it.
With two boats we went about 300 miles, and thus I had an excellent
opportunity of geologising and seeing much of the savages. The Fuegians
are in a more miserable state of barbarism than I had expected ever to
have seen a human being. In this inclement country they are absolutely
naked, and their temporary houses are like what children make in
summer with boughs of trees. I do not think any spectacle can be more
interesting than the first sight of man in his primitive wildness. It
is an interest which cannot well be imagined until it is experienced.
I shall never forget this when entering Good Success Bay--the yell with
which a party received us. They were seated on a rocky point, surrounded
by the dark forest of beech; as they threw their arms wildly round their
heads, and their long hair streaming, they seemed the troubled spirits
of another world. The climate in some respects is a curious mixture of
severity and mildness; as far as regards the animal kingdom, the
former character prevails; I have in consequence not added much to my
collections.

The Geology of this part of Tierra del Fuego was, as indeed every place
is, to me very interesting. The country is non-fossiliferous, and a
common-place succession of granitic rocks and slates; attempting to
make out the relation of cleavage, strata, etc., etc., was my chief
amusement. The mineralogy, however, of some of the rocks will, I think,
be curious from their resemblance to those of volcanic origin....

After leaving Tierra del Fuego we sailed to the Falklands. I forgot to
mention the fate of the Fuegians whom we took back to their country.
They had become entirely European in their habits and wishes, so much
so that the younger one had forgotten his own language, and their
countrymen paid but very little attention to them. We built houses for
them and planted gardens, but by the time we return again on our passage
round the Horn, I think it will be very doubtful how much of their
property will be left unstolen.

...When I am sea-sick and miserable, it is one of my highest
consolations to picture the future when we again shall be pacing
together the roads round Cambridge. That day is a weary long way off.
We have another cruise to make to Tierra del Fuego next summer, and then
our voyage round the world will really commence. Captain Fitz-Roy has
purchased a large schooner of 170 tons. In many respects it will be a
great advantage having a consort--perhaps it may somewhat shorten our
cruise, which I most cordially hope it may. I trust, however, that
the Coral Reefs and various animals of the Pacific may keep up my
resolution. Remember me most kindly to Mrs. Henslow and all other
friends; I am a true lover of Alma Mater and all its inhabitants.

Believe me, my dear Henslow, Your affectionate and most obliged friend,
CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS C. DARWIN. Maldonado, Rio Plata, May 22, 1833.

...The following business piece is to my father. Having a servant of
my own would be a really great addition to my comfort. For these two
reasons: as at present the Captain has appointed one of the men always
to be with me, but I do not think it just thus to take a seaman out of
the ship; and, secondly, when at sea I am rather badly off for any one
to wait on me. The man is willing to be my servant, and all the expenses
would be under 60 pounds per annum. I have taught him to shoot and skin
birds, so that in my main object he is very useful. I have now left
England nearly a year and a half, and I find my expenses are not above
200 pounds per annum; so that, it being hopeless (from time) to write
for permission, I have come to the conclusion that you would allow me
this expense. But I have not yet resolved to ask the Captain, and the
chances are even that he would not be willing to have an additional man
in the ship. I have mentioned this because for a long time I have been
thinking about it.

JUNE.

I have just received a bundle more letters. I do not know how to thank
you all sufficiently. One from Catherine, February 8th, another from
Susan, March 3rd, together with notes from Caroline and from my father;
give my best love to my father. I almost cried for pleasure at receiving
it; it was very kind thinking of writing to me. My letters are both
few, short, and stupid in return for all yours; but I always ease my
conscience by considering the Journal as a long letter. If I can
manage it, I will, before doubling the Horn, send the rest. I am quite
delighted to find the hide of the Megatherium has given you all some
little interest in my employments. These fragments are not, however,
by any means the most valuable of the geological relics. I trust and
believe that the time spent in this voyage, if thrown away for all other
respects, will produce its full worth in Natural History; and it appears
to me the doing what LITTLE we can to increase the general stock
of knowledge is as respectable an object of life as one can in any
likelihood pursue. It is more the result of such reflections (as I have
already said) than much immediate pleasure which now makes me continue
the voyage, together with the glorious prospect of the future, when
passing the Straits of Magellan, we have in truth the world before us.
Think of the Andes, the luxuriant forest of Guayaquil, the islands
of the South Sea, and New South Wales. How many magnificent and
characteristic views, how many and curious tribes of men we shall see!
What fine opportunities for geology and for studying the infinite host
of living beings! Is not this a prospect to keep up the most flagging
spirit? If I was to throw it away, I don't think I should ever rest
quiet in my grave. I certainly should be a ghost and haunt the British
Museum.

How famously the Ministers appear to be going on. I always much enjoy
political gossip and what you at home think will, etc., etc., take
place. I steadily read up the weekly paper, but it is not sufficient
to guide one's opinion; and I find it a very painful state not to be as
obstinate as a pig in politics. I have watched how steadily the general
feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What
a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which
utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after
living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only
alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro
character. It is impossible to see a negro and not feel kindly towards
him; such cheerful, open, honest expressions and such fine muscular
bodies. I never saw any of the diminutive Portuguese, with their
murderous countenances, without almost wishing for Brazil to follow the
example of Hayti; and, considering the enormous healthy-looking black
population, it will be wonderful if, at some future day, it does not
take place. There is at Rio a man (I know not his title) who has a
large salary to prevent (I believe) the landing of slaves; he lives
at Botofogo, and yet that was the bay where, during my residence, the
greater number of smuggled slaves were landed. Some of the Anti-Slavery
people ought to question about his office; it was the subject of
conversation at Rio amongst the lower English...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.M. HERBERT. Maldonado, Rio Plata, June 2, 1833.

My dear Herbert,

I have been confined for the last three days to a miserable dark room,
in an old Spanish house, from the torrents of rain; I am not, therefore,
in very good trim for writing; but, defying the blue devils, I will send
you a few lines, if it is merely to thank you very sincerely for writing
to me. I received your letter, dated December 1st, a short time since.
We are now passing part of the winter in the Rio Plata, after having
had a hard summer's work to the south. Tierra del Fuego is indeed a
miserable place; the ceaseless fury of the gales is quite tremendous.
One evening we saw old Cape Horn, and three weeks afterwards we were
only thirty miles to windward of it. It is a grand spectacle to see all
nature thus raging; but Heaven knows every one in the "Beagle" has seen
enough in this one summer to last them their natural lives.

The first place we landed at was Good Success Bay. It was here Banks
and Solander met such disasters on ascending one of the mountains. The
weather was tolerably fine, and I enjoyed some walks in a wild country,
like that behind Barmouth. The valleys are impenetrable from the
entangled woods, but the higher parts, near the limits of perpetual
snow, are bare. From some of these hills the scenery, from its savage,
solitary character, was most sublime. The only inhabitant of these
heights is the guanaco, and with its shrill neighing it often breaks the
stillness. The consciousness that no European foot had ever trod much
of this ground added to the delight of these rambles. How often and how
vividly have many of the hours spent at Barmouth come before my mind! I
look back to that time with no common pleasure; at this moment I can see
you seated on the hill behind the inn, almost as plainly as if you were
really there. It is necessary to be separated from all which one
has been accustomed to, to know how properly to treasure up such
recollections, and at this distance, I may add, how properly to esteem
such as yourself, my dear old Herbert. I wonder when I shall ever
see you again. I hope it may be, as you say, surrounded with heaps of
parchment; but then there must be, sooner or later, a dear little lady
to take care of you and your house. Such a delightful vision makes me
quite envious. This is a curious life for a regular shore-going person
such as myself; the worst part of it is its extreme length. There
is certainly a great deal of high enjoyment, and on the contrary a
tolerable share of vexation of spirit. Everything, however, shall bend
to the pleasure of grubbing up old bones, and captivating new animals.
By the way, you rank my Natural History labours far too high. I am
nothing more than a lions' provider: I do not feel at all sure that they
will not growl and finally destroy me.

It does one's heart good to hear how things are going on in England.
Hurrah for the honest Whigs! I trust they will soon attack that
monstrous stain on our boasted liberty, Colonial Slavery. I have seen
enough of Slavery and the dispositions of the negroes, to be thoroughly
disgusted with the lies and nonsense one hears on the subject in
England. Thank God, the cold-hearted Tories, who, as J. Mackintosh used
to say, have no enthusiasm, except against enthusiasm, have for the
present run their race. I am sorry, by your letter, to hear you have not
been well, and that you partly attribute it to want of exercise. I wish
you were here amongst the green plains; we would take walks which would
rival the Dolgelly ones, and you should tell stories, which I would
believe, even to a CUBIC FATHOM OF PUDDING. Instead I must take my
solitary ramble, think of Cambridge days, and pick up snakes, beetles
and toads. Excuse this short letter (you know I never studied 'The
Complete Letter-writer'), and believe me, my dear Herbert,

Your affectionate friend, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. East Falkland Island, March, 1834.

...I am quite charmed with Geology, but like the wise animal between
two bundles of hay, I do not know which to like the best; the old
crystalline group of rocks, or the softer and fossiliferous beds. When
puzzling about stratifications, etc., I feel inclined to cry "a fig for
your big oysters, and your bigger megatheriums." But then when digging
out some fine bones, I wonder how any man can tire his arms with
hammering granite. By the way I have not one clear idea about cleavage,
stratification, lines of upheaval. I have no books which tell me much,
and what they do I cannot apply to what I see. In consequence I draw
my own conclusions, and most gloriously ridiculous ones they are, I
sometimes fancy...Can you throw any light into my mind by telling me
what relation cleavage and planes of deposition bear to each other?

And now for my second SECTION, Zoology. I have chiefly been employed
in preparing myself for the South Sea by examining the polypi of the
smaller Corallines in these latitudes. Many in themselves are very
curious, and I think are quite undescribed; there was one appalling one,
allied to a Flustra, which I dare say I mentioned having found to the
northward, where the cells have a movable organ (like a vulture's head,
with a dilatable beak), fixed on the edge. But what is of more general
interest is the unquestionable (as it appears to me) existence of
another species of ostrich, besides the Struthio rhea. All the Gauchos
and Indians state it is the case, and I place the greatest faith in
their observations. I have the head, neck, piece of skin, feathers, and
legs of one. The differences are chiefly in the colour of the feathers
and scales on legs, being feathered below the knees, nidification, and
geographical distribution. So much for what I have lately done; the
prospect before me is full of sunshine, fine weather, glorious scenery,
the geology of the Andes, plains abounding with organic remains (which
perhaps I may have the good luck to catch in the very act of moving),
and lastly, an ocean, its shores abounding with life, so that, if
nothing unforeseen happens, I will stick to the voyage, although for
what I can see this may last till we return a fine set of white-headed
old gentlemen. I have to thank you most cordially for sending me the
books. I am now reading the Oxford 'Report' (The second meeting of the
British Association was held at Oxford in 1832, the following year
it was at Cambridge.); the whole account of your proceedings is most
glorious; you remaining in England cannot well imagine how excessively
interesting I find the reports. I am sure from my own thrilling
sensations when reading them, that they cannot fail to have an excellent
effect upon all those residing in distant colonies, and who have
little opportunity of seeing the periodicals. My hammer has flown with
redoubled force on the devoted blocks; as I thought over the eloquence
of the Cambridge President, I hit harder and harder blows. I hope to
give my arms strength for the Cordilleras. You will send me through
Capt. Beaufort a copy of the Cambridge 'Report.'

I have forgotten to mention that for some time past, and for the future,
I will put a pencil cross on the pill-boxes containing insects, as these
alone will require being kept particularly dry; it may perhaps save you
some trouble. When this letter will go I do not know, as this little
seat of discord has lately been embroiled by a dreadful scene of murder,
and at present there are more prisoners than inhabitants. If a merchant
vessel is chartered to take them to Rio, I will send some specimens
(especially my few plants and seeds). Remember me to all my Cambridge
friends. I love and treasure up every recollection of dear old
Cambridge. I am much obliged to you for putting my name down to poor
Ramsay's monument; I never think of him without the warmest admiration.
Farewell, my dear Henslow.

Believe me your most obliged and affectionate friend, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS C. DARWIN. East Falkland Island, April 6, 1834.

My dear Catherine,

When this letter will reach you I know not, but probably some man-of-war
will call here before, in the common course of events, I should have
another opportunity of writing....

After visiting some of the southern islands, we beat up through the
magnificent scenery of the Beagle Channel to Jemmy Button's country.
(Jemmy Button, York Minster, and Fuegia Basket, were natives of Tierra
del Fuego, brought to England by Captain Fitz-Roy in his former voyage,
and restored to their country by him in 1832.) We could hardly recognise
poor Jemmy. Instead of the clean, well-dressed stout lad we left him,
we found him a naked, thin, squalid savage. York and Fuegia had moved to
their own country some months ago, the former having stolen all Jemmy's
clothes. Now he had nothing except a bit of blanket round his waist.
Poor Jemmy was very glad to see us, and, with his usual good feeling,
brought several presents (otter-skins, which are most valuable to
themselves) for his old friends. The Captain offered to take him to
England, but this, to our surprise, he at once refused. In the evening
his young wife came alongside and showed us the reason. He was quite
contented. Last year, in the height of his indignation, he said "his
country people no sabe nothing--damned fools"--now they were very good
people, with TOO much to eat, and all the luxuries of life. Jemmy and
his wife paddled away in their canoe loaded with presents, and very
happy. The most curious thing is, that Jemmy, instead of recovering his
own language, has taught all his friends a little English. "J. Button's
canoe" and "Jemmy's wife come," "Give me knife," etc., was said by
several of them.

We then bore away for this island--this little miserable seat of
discord. We found that the Gauchos, under pretence of a revolution, had
murdered and plundered all the Englishmen whom they could catch, and
some of their own countrymen. All the economy at home makes the foreign
movements of England most contemptible. How different from old Spain.
Here we, dog-in-the-manger fashion, seize an island, and leave to
protect it a Union Jack; the possessor has, of course, been murdered;
we now send a lieutenant with four sailors, without authority or
instructions. A man-of-war, however, ventured to leave a party of
marines, and by their assistance, and the treachery of some of the
party, the murderers have all been taken, there being now as many
prisoners as inhabitants. This island must some day become a very
important halting-place in the most turbulent sea in the world. It is
mid-way between Australia and the South Sea to England; between Chili,
Peru, etc., and the Rio Plata and the Rio de Janeiro. There are fine
harbours, plenty of fresh water, and good beef. It would doubtless
produce the coarser vegetables. In other respects it is a wretched
place. A little time since, I rode across the island, and returned in
four days. My excursion would have been longer, but during the whole
time it blew a gale of wind, with hail and snow. There is no firewood
bigger than heath, and the whole country is, more or less an elastic
peat-bog. Sleeping out at night was too miserable work to endure it for
all the rocks in South America.

We shall leave this scene of iniquity in two or three days, and go to
the Rio de la Sta. Cruz. One of the objects is to look at the ship's
bottom. We struck heavily on an unknown rock off Port Desire, and some
of her copper is torn off. After this is repaired the Captain has a
glorious scheme; it is to go to the very head of this river, that is
probably to the Andes. It is quite unknown; the Indians tell us it is
two or three hundred yards broad, and horses can nowhere ford it. I
cannot imagine anything more interesting. Our plans then are to go
to Fort Famine, and there we meet the "Adventure", who is employed in
making the Chart of the Falklands. This will be in the middle of winter,
so I shall see Tierra del Fuego in her white drapery. We leave the
straits to enter the Pacific by the Barbara Channel, one very little
known, and which passes close to the foot of Mount Sarmiento (the
highest mountain in the south, excepting Mt.!! Darwin!!). We then shall
scud away for Concepcion in Chili. I believe the ship must once again
steer southward, but if any one catches me there again, I will give him
leave to hang me up as a scarecrow for all future naturalists. I long
to be at work in the Cordilleras, the geology of this side, which
I understand pretty well is so intimately connected with periods of
violence in that great chain of mountains. The future is, indeed, to
me a brilliant prospect. You say its very brilliancy frightens you; but
really I am very careful; I may mention as a proof, in all my rambles I
have never had any one accident or scrape...Continue in your good custom
of writing plenty of gossip; I much like hearing all about all things.
Remember me most kindly to Uncle Jos, and to all the Wedgwoods. Tell
Charlotte (their married names sound downright unnatural) I should like
to have written to her, to have told her how well everything is going
on; but it would only have been a transcript of this letter, and I
have a host of animals at this minute surrounding me which all require
embalming and numbering. I have not forgotten the comfort I received
that day at Maer, when my mind was like a swinging pendulum. Give my
best love to my father. I hope he will forgive all my extravagance, but
not as a Christian, for then I suppose he would send me no more money.

Good-bye, dear, to you, and all your goodly sisterhood.

Your affectionate brother, CHAS. DARWIN.

My love to Nancy (His old nurse.); tell her, if she was now to see me
with my great beard, she would think I was some worthy Solomon, come to
sell the trinkets.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. WHITLEY. Valparaiso, July 23, 1834.

My dear Whitley,

I have long intended writing, just to put you in mind that there is a
certain hunter of beetles, and pounder of rocks still in existence. Why
I have not done so before I know not, but it will serve me right if you
have quite forgotten me. It is a very long time since I have heard any
Cambridge news; I neither know where you are living or what you are
doing. I saw your name down as one of the indefatigable guardians of the
eighteen hundred philosophers. I was delighted to see this, for when
we last left Cambridge you were at sad variance with poor science; you
seemed to think her a public prostitute working for popularity. If your
opinions are the same as formerly, you would agree most admirably with
Captain Fitz-Roy,--the object of his most devout abhorrence is one of
the d--d scientific Whigs. As captains of men-of-war are the greatest
men going, far greater than kings or schoolmasters, I am obliged to tell
him everything in my own favour. I have often said I once had a very
good friend, an out-and-out Tory, and we managed to get on very well
together. But he is very much inclined to doubt if ever I really was so
much honoured; at present we hear scarcely anything about politics; this
saves a great deal of trouble, for we all stick to our former opinions
rather more obstinately than before, and can give rather fewer reasons
for doing so.

I do hope you will write to me: ('H.M.S. "Beagle", S. American Station'
will find me). I should much like to hear in what state you are both in
body and mind. ?Quien Sabe? as the people say here (and God knows they
well may, for they do know little enough), if you are not a married man,
and may be nursing, as Miss Austen says, little olive branches, little
pledges of mutual affection. Eheu! Eheu! this puts me in mind of former
visions of glimpses into futurity, where I fancied I saw retirement,
green cottages, and white petticoats. What will become of me hereafter
I know not; I feel like a ruined man, who does not see or care how to
extricate himself. That this voyage must come to a conclusion my
reason tells me, but otherwise I see no end to it. It is impossible not
bitterly to regret the friends and other sources of pleasure one leaves
behind in England; in place of it there is much solid enjoyment, some
present, but more in anticipation, when the ideas gained during the
voyage can be compared to fresh ones. I find in Geology a never-failing
interest, as it has been remarked, it creates the same grand ideas
respecting this world which Astronomy does for the universe. We have
seen much fine scenery; that of the Tropics in its glory and luxuriance
exceeds even the language of Humboldt to describe. A Persian writer
could alone do justice to it, and if he succeeded he would in England be
called the 'Grandfather of all liars.'

But I have seen nothing which more completely astonished me than the
first sight of a savage. It was a naked Fuegian, his long hair blowing
about, his face besmeared with paint. There is in their countenances
an expression which I believe, to those who have not seen it, must
be inconceivably wild. Standing on a rock he uttered tones and made
gesticulations, than which the cries of domestic animals are far more
intelligible.

When I return to England, you must take me in hand with respect to the
fine arts. I yet recollect there was a man called Raffaelle Sanctus. How
delightful it will be once again to see, in the Fitzwilliam, Titian's
Venus. How much more than delightful to go to some good concert or fine
opera. These recollections will not do. I shall not be able to-morrow
to pick out the entrails of some small animal with half my usual
gusto. Pray tell me some news about Cameron, Watkins, Marindin, the two
Thompsons of Trinity, Lowe, Heaviside, Matthew. Herbert I have heard
from. How is Henslow getting on? and all other good friends of dear
Cambridge? Often and often do I think over those past hours, so many of
which have been passed in your company. Such can never return, but their
recollection can never die away.

God bless you, my dear Whitley, Believe me, your most sincere friend,
CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS C. DARWIN. Valparaiso, November 8, 1834.

My dear Catherine,

My last letter was rather a gloomy one, for I was not very well when I
wrote it. Now everything is as bright as sunshine. I am quite well again
after being a second time in bed for a fortnight. Captain Fitz-Roy very
generously has delayed the ship ten days on my account, and without at
the time telling me for what reason.

We have had some strange proceedings on board the "Beagle", but which
have ended most capitally for all hands. Captain Fitz-Roy has for
the last two months been working EXTREMELY hard, and at the same time
constantly annoyed by interruptions from officers of other ships; the
selling the schooner and its consequences were very vexatious; the
cold manner the Admiralty (solely I believe because he is a Tory) have
treated him, and a thousand other, etc. etc.'s, has made him very thin
and unwell. This was accompanied by a morbid depression of spirits, and
a loss of all decision and resolution... All that Bynoe [the Surgeon]
could say, that it was merely the effect of bodily health and exhaustion
after such application, would not do; he invalided, and Wickham was
appointed to the command. By the instructions Wickham could only finish
the survey of the southern part, and would then have been obliged to
return direct to England. The grief on board the "Beagle" about the
Captain's decision was universal and deeply felt; one great source
of his annoyment was the feeling it impossible to fulfil the whole
instructions; from his state of mind it never occurred to him that the
very instructions ordered him to do as much of the West coast AS HE HAS
TIME FOR, and then proceed across the Pacific.

Wickham (very disinterestedly giving up his own promotion) urged this
most strongly, stated that when he took the command nothing should
induce him to go to Tierra del Fuego again; and then asked the Captain
what would be gained by his resignation? why not do the more useful
part, and return as commanded by the Pacific. The Captain at last, to
every one's joy, consented, and the resignation was withdrawn.

Hurrah! hurrah! it is fixed the "Beagle" shall not go one mile south of
Cape Tres Montes (about 200 miles south of Chiloe), and from that point
to Valparaiso will be finished in about five months. We shall examine
the Chonos Archipelago, entirely unknown, and the curious inland sea
behind Chiloe. For me it is glorious. Cape Tres Montes is the most
southern point where there is much geological interest, as there the
modern beds end. The Captain then talks of crossing the Pacific; but
I think we shall persuade him to finish the Coast of Peru, where the
climate is delightful, the country hideously sterile, but abounding with
the highest interest to a geologist. For the first time since leaving
England I now see a clear and not so distant prospect of returning to
you all: crossing the Pacific, and from Sydney home, will not take much
time.

As soon as the Captain invalided I at once determined to leave the
"Beagle", but it was quite absurd what a revolution in five minutes was
effected in all my feelings. I have long been grieved and most sorry
at the interminable length of the voyage (although I never would have
quitted it); but the minute it was all over, I could not make up my mind
to return. I could not give up all the geological castles in the air
which I had been building up for the last two years. One whole night
I tried to think over the pleasure of seeing Shrewsbury again, but the
barren plains of Peru gained the day. I made the following scheme (I
know you will abuse me, and perhaps if I had put it in execution, my
father would have sent a mandamus after me); it was to examine the
Cordilleras of Chili during this summer, and in winter go from port
to port on the coast of Peru to Lima, returning this time next year
to Valparaiso, cross the Cordilleras to Buenos Ayres, and take ship
to England. Would not this have been a fine excursion, and in sixteen
months I should have been with you all? To have endured Tierra del Fuego
and not seen the Pacific would have been miserable...

I go on board to-morrow; I have been for the last six weeks in
Corfield's house. You cannot imagine what a kind friend I have
found him. He is universally liked, and respected by the natives and
foreigners. Several Chileno Signoritas are very obligingly anxious to
become the signoras of this house. Tell my father I have kept my promise
of being extravagant in Chili. I have drawn a bill of 100 pounds (had it
not better be notified to Messrs. Robarts & Co.); 50 pounds goes to the
Captain for the ensuing year, and 30 pounds I take to sea for the small
ports; so that bona fide I have not spent 180 pounds during these last
four months. I hope not to draw another bill for six months. All the
foregoing particulars were only settled yesterday. It has done me more
good than a pint of medicine, and I have not been so happy for the last
year. If it had not been for my illness, these four months in Chili
would have been very pleasant. I have had ill luck, however, in only one
little earthquake having happened. I was lying in bed when there was a
party at dinner in the house; on a sudden I heard such a hubbub in the
dining-room; without a word being spoken, it was devil take the hindmost
who should get out first; at the same moment I felt my bed SLIGHTLY
vibrate in a lateral direction. The party were old stagers, and heard
the noise which always precedes a shock; and no old stager looks at an
earthquake with philosophical eyes...

Good-bye to you all; you will not have another letter for some time.

My dear Catherine, Yours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.

My best love to my father, and all of you. Love to Nancy.


CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS S. DARWIN. Valparaiso, April 23, 1835.

My dear Susan,

I received, a few days since, your letter of November; the three letters
which I before mentioned are yet missing, but I do not doubt they will
come to life. I returned a week ago from my excursion across the Andes
to Mendoza. Since leaving England I have never made so successful a
journey; it has, however, been very expensive. I am sure my father would
not regret it, if he could know how deeply I have enjoyed it: it was
something more than enjoyment; I cannot express the delight which I
felt at such a famous winding-up of all my geology in South America. I
literally could hardly sleep at nights for thinking over my day's work.
The scenery was so new, and so majestic; everything at an elevation of
12,000 feet bears so different an aspect from that in a lower country. I
have seen many views more beautiful, but none with so strongly marked
a character. To a geologist, also, there are such manifest proofs of
excessive violence; the strata of the highest pinnacles are tossed about
like the crust of a broken pie.

I crossed by the Portillo Pass, which at this time of the year is apt to
be dangerous, so could not afford to delay there. After staying a day in
the stupid town of Mendoza, I began my return by Uspallate, which I did
very leisurely. My whole trip only took up twenty-two days. I travelled
with, for me, uncommon comfort, as I carried a BED! My party consisted
of two Peons and ten mules, two of which were with baggage, or rather
food, in case of being snowed up. Everything, however, favoured me;
not even a speck of this year's snow had fallen on the road. I do not
suppose any of you can be much interested in geological details, but
I will just mention my principal results:--Besides understanding to
a certain extent the description and manner of the force which has
elevated this great line of mountains, I can clearly demonstrate that
one part of the double line is of an age long posterior to the other.
In the more ancient line, which is the true chain of the Andes, I can
describe the sort and order of the rocks which compose it. These are
chiefly remarkable by containing a bed of gypsum nearly 2000 feet
thick--a quantity of this substance I should think unparalleled in
the world. What is of much greater consequence, I have procured fossil
shells (from an elevation of 12,000 feet). I think an examination of
these will give an approximate age to these mountains, as compared to
the strata of Europe. In the other line of the Cordilleras there is a
strong presumption (in my own mind, conviction) that the enormous mass
of mountains, the peaks of which rise to 13,000 and 14,000 feet, are so
very modern as to be contemporaneous with the plains of Patagonia (or
about with the UPPER strata of the Isle of Wight). If this result shall
be considered as proved (The importance of these results has been fully
recognised by geologists.), it is a very important fact in the theory
of the formation of the world; because, if such wonderful changes have
taken place so recently in the crust of the globe, there can be no
reason for supposing former epochs of excessive violence. These modern
strata are very remarkable by being threaded with metallic veins of
silver, gold, copper, etc.; hitherto these have been considered as
appertaining to older formations. In these same beds, and close to a
goldmine, I found a clump of petrified trees, standing up right, with
layers of fine sandstone deposited round them, bearing the impression of
their bark. These trees are covered by other sandstones and streams of
lava to the thickness of several thousand feet. These rocks have been
deposited beneath water; yet it is clear the spot where the trees grew
must once have been above the level of the sea, so that it is certain
the land must have been depressed by at least as many thousand feet as
the superincumbent subaqueous deposits are thick. But I am afraid you
will tell me I am prosy with my geological descriptions and theories...

Your account of Erasmus' visit to Cambridge has made me long to be back
there. I cannot fancy anything more delightful than his Sunday round of
King's, Trinity, and those talking giants, Whewell and Sedgwick; I hope
your musical tastes continue in due force. I shall be ravenous for the
pianoforte...

I have not quite determined whether I will sleep at the 'Lion' the first
night when I arrive per 'Wonder,' or disturb you all in the dead of
night; everything short of that is absolutely planned. Everything about
Shrewsbury is growing in my mind bigger and more beautiful; I am certain
the acacia and copper beech are two superb trees; I shall know every
bush, and I will trouble you young ladies, when each of you cut down
your tree, to spare a few. As for the view behind the house, I have seen
nothing like it. It is the same with North Wales; Snowdon, to my
mind, looks much higher and much more beautiful than any peak in the
Cordilleras. So you will say, with my benighted faculties, it is time to
return, and so it is, and I long to be with you. Whatever the trees are,
I know what I shall find all you. I am writing nonsense, so farewell. My
most affectionate love to all, and I pray forgiveness from my father.

Yours most affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Lima, July, 1835.

My dear Fox,

I have lately received two of your letters, one dated June and the other
November, 1834 (they reached me, however, in an inverted order). I was
very glad to receive a history of this most important year in your life.
Previously I had only heard the plain fact that you were married. You
are a true Christian and return good for evil, to send two such letters
to so bad a correspondent as I have been. God bless you for writing
so kindly and affectionately; if it is a pleasure to have friends in
England, it is doubly so to think and know that one is not forgotten
because absent. This voyage is terribly long. I do so earnestly desire
to return, yet I dare hardly look forward to the future, for I do not
know what will become of me. Your situation is above envy: I do not
venture even to frame such happy visions. To a person fit to take the
office, the life of a clergyman is a type of all that is respectable and
happy. You tempt me by talking of your fireside, whereas it is a sort
of scene I never ought to think about. I saw the other day a vessel
sail for England; it was quite dangerous to know how easily I might
turn deserter. As for an English lady, I have almost forgotten what
she is--something very angelic and good. As for the women in these
countries, they wear caps and petticoats, and a very few have pretty
faces, and then all is said. But if we are not wrecked on some unlucky
reef, I will sit by that same fireside in Vale Cottage and tell some of
the wonderful stories, which you seem to anticipate and, I presume, are
not very ready to believe. Gracias a dios, the prospect of such times is
rather shorter than formerly.

From this most wretched 'City of the Kings' we sail in a fortnight, from
thence to Guayaquil, Galapagos, Marquesas, Society Islands, etc., etc. I
look forward to the Galapagos with more interest than any other part
of the voyage. They abound with active volcanoes, and, I should hope,
contain Tertiary strata. I am glad to hear you have some thoughts of
beginning Geology. I hope you will; there is so much larger a field for
thought than in the other branches of Natural History. I am become a
zealous disciple of Mr. Lyell's views, as known in his admirable book.
Geologising in South America, I am tempted to carry parts to a greater
extent even than he does. Geology is a capital science to begin, as it
requires nothing but a little reading, thinking, and hammering. I have
a considerable body of notes together; but it is a constant subject of
perplexity to me, whether they are of sufficient value for all the time
I have spent about them, or whether animals would not have been of more
certain value.

I shall indeed be glad once again to see you and tell you how grateful I
feel for your steady friendship. God bless you, my very dear Fox.

Believe me, Yours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Sydney, January, 1836.

My dear Henslow,

This is the last opportunity of communicating with you before that
joyful day when I shall reach Cambridge. I have very little to say:
but I must write if it is only to express my joy that the last year is
concluded, and that the present one, in which the "Beagle" will return,
is gliding onwards. We have all been disappointed here in not finding
even a single letter; we are, indeed, rather before our expected time,
otherwise, I dare say, I should have seen your handwriting. I must
feed upon the future, and it is beyond bounds delightful to feel the
certainty that within eight months I shall be residing once again most
quietly in Cambridge. Certainly, I never was intended for a traveller;
my thoughts are always rambling over past or future scenes; I cannot
enjoy the present happiness for anticipating the future, which is about
as foolish as the dog who dropped the real bone for its shadow....

In our passage across the Pacific we only touched at Tahiti and New
Zealand; at neither of these places or at sea had I much opportunity
of working. Tahiti is a most charming spot. Everything which former
navigators have written is true. 'A new Cytheraea has risen from the
ocean.' Delicious scenery, climate, manners of the people are all in
harmony. It is, moreover, admirable to behold what the missionaries both
here and at New Zealand have effected. I firmly believe they are good
men working for the sake of a good cause. I much suspect that those who
have abused or sneered at the missionaries have generally been such as
were not very anxious to find the natives moral and intelligent beings.
During the remainder of our voyage we shall only visit places generally
acknowledged as civilised, and nearly all under the British flag. These
will be a poor field for Natural History, and without it I have lately
discovered that the pleasure of seeing new places is as nothing. I must
return to my old resource and think of the future, but that I may not
become more prosy, I will say farewell till the day arrives, when I
shall see my Master in Natural History, and can tell him how grateful I
feel for his kindness and friendship.

Believe me, dear Henslow, Ever yours, most faithfully, CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS S. DARWIN. Bahia, Brazil, August 4 [1836].

My dear Susan,

I will just write a few lines to explain the cause of this letter being
dated on the coast of South America. Some singular disagreements in the
longitudes made Captain Fitz-Roy anxious to complete the circle in the
southern hemisphere, and then retrace our steps by our first line to
England. This zigzag manner of proceeding is very grievous; it has put
the finishing stroke to my feelings. I loathe, I abhor the sea and all
ships which sail on it. But I yet believe we shall reach England in the
latter half of October. At Ascension I received Catherine's letter of
October, and yours of November; the letter at the Cape was of a later
date, but letters of all sorts are inestimable treasures, and I
thank you both for them. The desert, volcanic rocks, and wild sea of
Ascension, as soon as I knew there was news from home, suddenly wore a
pleasing aspect, and I set to work with a good-will at my old work of
Geology. You would be surprised to know how entirely the pleasure in
arriving at a new place depends on letters. We only stayed four days at
Ascension, and then made a very good passage to Bahia.

I little thought to have put my foot on South American coast again.
It has been almost painful to find how much good enthusiasm has been
evaporated during the last four years. I can now walk soberly through
a Brazilian forest; not but what it is exquisitely beautiful, but now,
instead of seeking for splendid contrasts, I compare the stately mango
trees with the horse-chestnuts of England. Although this zigzag has lost
us at least a fortnight, in some respects I am glad of it. I think I
shall be able to carry away one vivid picture of inter-tropical scenery.
We go from hence to the Cape de Verds; that is, if the winds or the
Equatorial calms will allow us. I have some faint hopes that a steady
foul wind might induce the Captain to proceed direct to the Azores. For
which most untoward event I heartily pray.

Both your letters were full of good news; especially the expressions
which you tell me Professor Sedgwick used about my collections. I
confess they are deeply gratifying--I trust one part at least will turn
out true, and that I shall act as I now think--as a man who dares to
waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life. Professor
Sedgwick mentioning my name at all gives me hopes that he will assist me
with his advice, of which, in my geological questions, I stand much in
need. It is useless to tell you from the shameful state of this scribble
that I am writing against time, having been out all morning, and now
there are some strangers on board to whom I must go down and talk
civility. Moreover, as this letter goes by a foreign ship, it is
doubtful whether it will ever arrive. Farewell, my very dear Susan and
all of you. Good-bye.

C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. St. Helena, July 9, 1836.

My dear Henslow,

I am going to ask you to do me a favour. I am very anxious to belong to
the Geological Society. I do not know, but I suppose it is necessary to
be proposed some time before being ballotted for; if such is the case,
would you be good enough to take the proper preparatory steps? Professor
Sedgwick very kindly offered to propose me before leaving England, if he
should happen to be in London. I dare say he would yet do so.

I have very little to write about. We have neither seen, done, or heard
of anything particular for a long time past; and indeed if at present
the wonders of another planet could be displayed before us, I believe we
should unanimously exclaim, what a consummate plague. No schoolboys ever
sung the half sentimental and half jovial strain of 'dulce domum' with
more fervour, than we all feel inclined to do. But the whole subject
of 'dulce domum,' and the delight of seeing one's friends, is most
dangerous, it must infallibly make one very prosy or very boisterous.
Oh, the degree to which I long to be once again living quietly with not
one single novel object near me! No one can imagine it till he has been
whirled round the world during five long years in a ten-gun-brig. I am
at present living in a small house (amongst the clouds) in the centre of
the island, and within stone's throw of Napoleon's tomb. It is blowing
a gale of wind with heavy rain and wretchedly cold; if Napoleon's ghost
haunts his dreary place of confinement, this would be a most excellent
night for such wandering spirits. If the weather chooses to permit me,
I hope to see a little of the Geology (so often partially described) of
the island. I suspect that differently from most volcanic islands its
structure is rather complicated. It seems strange that this little
centre of a distinct creation should, as is asserted, bear marks of
recent elevation.

The "Beagle" proceeds from this place to Ascension, then to the Cape de
Verds (what miserable places!) to the Azores to Plymouth, and then
to home. That most glorious of all days in my life will not, however,
arrive till the middle of October. Some time in that month you will see
me at Cambridge, where I must directly come to report myself to you, as
my first Lord of the Admiralty. At the Cape of Good Hope we all on board
suffered a bitter disappointment in missing nine months' letters, which
are chasing us from one side of the globe to the other. I dare say
amongst them there was a letter from you; it is long since I have
seen your handwriting, but I shall soon see you yourself, which is
far better. As I am your pupil, you are bound to undertake the task of
criticising and scolding me for all the things ill done and not done at
all, which I fear I shall need much; but I hope for the best, and I am
sure I have a good if not too easy taskmaster.

At the Cape Captain Fitz-Roy and myself enjoyed a memorable piece of
good fortune in meeting Sir J. Herschel. We dined at his house and
saw him a few times besides. He was exceedingly good natured, but his
manners at first appeared to me rather awful. He is living in a very
comfortable country house, surrounded by fir and oak trees, which alone
in so open a country, give a most charming air of seclusion and comfort.
He appears to find time for everything; he showed us a pretty garden
full of Cape bulbs of his own collecting, and I afterwards understood
that everything was the work of his own hands...I am very stupid, and I
have nothing more to say; the wind is whistling so mournfully over the
bleak hills, that I shall go to bed and dream of England.

Goodnight, my dear Henslow, Yours most truly obliged and affectionately,
CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Shrewsbury, Thursday, October 6, [1836].

My dear Henslow,

I am sure you will congratulate me on the delight of once again being
home. The "Beagle" arrived at Falmouth on Sunday evening, and I reached
Shrewsbury yesterday morning. I am exceedingly anxious to see you, and
as it will be necessary in four or five days to return to London to get
my goods and chattels out of the "Beagle", it appears to me my best plan
to pass through Cambridge. I want your advice on many points; indeed I
am in the clouds, and neither know what to do or where to go. My chief
puzzle is about the geological specimens--who will have the charity
to help me in describing their mineralogical nature? Will you be kind
enough to write to me one line by RETURN OF POST, saying whether you
are now at Cambridge? I am doubtful till I hear from Captain Fitz-Roy
whether I shall not be obliged to start before the answer can arrive,
but pray try the chance. My dear Henslow, I do long to see you; you have
been the kindest friend to me that ever man possessed. I can write no
more, for I am giddy with joy and confusion.

Farewell for the present, Yours most truly obliged, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO R. FITZ-ROY. Shrewsbury, Thursday morning, October 6,
[1836].

My dear Fitz-Roy,

I arrived here yesterday morning at breakfast time, and, thank God,
found all my dear good sisters and father quite well. My father appears
more cheerful and very little older than when I left. My sisters assure
me I do not look the least different, and I am able to return the
compliment. Indeed, all England appears changed excepting the good old
town of Shrewsbury and its inhabitants, which, for all I can see to
the contrary, may go on as they now are to Doomsday. I wish with all
my heart I was writing to you amongst your friends instead of at that
horrid Plymouth. But the day will soon come, and you will be as happy as
I now am. I do assure you I am a very great man at home; the five years'
voyage has certainly raised me a hundred per cent. I fear such greatness
must experience a fall.

I am thoroughly ashamed of myself in what a dead-and-half-alive state I
spent the few last days on board; my only excuse is that certainly I was
not quite well. The first day in the mail tired me, but as I drew nearer
to Shrewsbury everything looked more beautiful and cheerful. In passing
Gloucestershire and Worcestershire I wished much for you to admire the
fields, woods, and orchards. The stupid people on the coach did not seem
to think the fields one bit greener than usual; but I am sure we should
have thoroughly agreed that the wide world does not contain so happy a
prospect as the rich cultivated land of England.

I hope you will not forget to send me a note telling me how you go on.
I do indeed hope all your vexations and trouble with respect to our
voyage, which we now know HAS an end, have come to a close. If you do
not receive much satisfaction for all the mental and bodily energy you
have expended in His Majesty's service, you will be most hardly treated.
I put my radical sisters into an uproar at some of the prudent (if
they were not honest Whigs, I would say shabby) proceedings of our
Government. By the way, I must tell you for the honour and glory of the
family that my father has a large engraving of King George IV. put up
in his sitting-room. But I am no renegade, and by the time we meet my
politics will be as firmly fixed and as wisely founded as ever they
were.

I thought when I began this letter I would convince you what a steady
and sober frame of mind I was in. But I find I am writing most precious
nonsense. Two or three of our labourers yesterday immediately set to
work and got most excessively drunk in honour of the arrival of Master
Charles. Who then shall gainsay if Master Charles himself chooses to
make himself a fool. Good-bye. God bless you! I hope you are as happy,
but much wiser, than your most sincere but unworthy philosopher,

CHAS. DARWIN.




CHAPTER 1.VII. -- LONDON AND CAMBRIDGE.

1836-1842.

[The period illustrated by the following letters includes the years
between my father's return from the voyage of the "Beagle" and his
settling at Down. It is marked by the gradual appearance of that
weakness of health which ultimately forced him to leave London and take
up his abode for the rest of his life in a quiet country house.]

In June, 1841, he writes to Lyell: "My father scarcely seems to expect
that I shall become strong for some years; it has been a bitter
mortification for me to digest the conclusion that the 'race is for the
strong,' and that I shall probably do little more but be content to
admire the strides others make in science."

There is no evidence of any intention of entering a profession after his
return from the voyage, and early in 1840 he wrote to Fitz-Roy: "I
have nothing to wish for, excepting stronger health to go on with the
subjects to which I have joyfully determined to devote my life."

These two conditions--permanent ill-health and a passionate love of
scientific work for its own sake--determined thus early in his career,
the character of his whole future life. They impelled him to lead a
retired life of constant labour, carried on to the utmost limits of his
physical power, a life which signally falsified his melancholy prophecy.

The end of the last chapter saw my father safely arrived at Shrewsbury
on October 4, 1836, "after an absence of five years and two days." He
wrote to Fox: "You cannot imagine how gloriously delightful my first
visit was at home; it was worth the banishment." But it was a pleasure
that he could not long enjoy, for in the last days of October he was at
Greenwich unpacking specimens from the "Beagle". As to the destination
of the collections he writes, somewhat despondingly, to Henslow:--

"I have not made much progress with the great men. I find, as you told
me, that they are all overwhelmed with their own business. Mr. Lyell
has entered, in the MOST good-natured manner, and almost without being
asked, into all my plans. He tells me, however, the same story, that
I must do all myself. Mr. Owen seems anxious to dissect some of the
animals in spirits, and, besides these two, I have scarcely met any
one who seems to wish to possess any of my specimens. I must except Dr.
Grant, who is willing to examine some of the corallines. I see it is
quite unreasonable to hope for a minute that any man will undertake
the examination of a whole order. It is clear the collectors so much
outnumber the real naturalists that the latter have no time to spare.

"I do not even find that the Collections care for receiving the unnamed
specimens. The Zoological Museum (The Museum of the Zoological Society,
then at 33 Bruton Street. The collection was some years later broken
up and dispersed.) is nearly full, and upwards of a thousand specimens
remain unmounted. I dare say the British Museum would receive them, but
I cannot feel, from all I hear, any great respect even for the present
state of that establishment. Your plan will be not only the best, but
the only one, namely, to come down to Cambridge, arrange and group
together the different families, and then wait till people, who are
already working in different branches, may want specimens. But it
appears to me [that] to do this it will be almost necessary to reside
in London. As far as I can yet see my best plan will be to spend several
months in Cambridge, and then when, by your assistance, I know on what
ground I stand, to emigrate to London, where I can complete my Geology
and try to push on the Zoology. I assure you I grieve to find how many
things make me see the necessity of living for some time in this
dirty, odious London. For even in Geology I suspect much assistance and
communication will be necessary in this quarter, for instance, in fossil
bones, of which none excepting the fragments of Megatherium have been
looked at, and I clearly see that without my presence they never would
be....

"I only wish I had known the Botanists cared so much for specimens (A
passage in a subsequent letter shows that his plants also gave him some
anxiety. "I met Mr. Brown a few days after you had called on him; he
asked me in rather an ominous manner what I meant to do with my plants.
In the course of conversation Mr. Broderip, who was present, remarked
to him, 'You forget how long it is since Captain King's expedition.'
He answered, 'Indeed, I have something in the shape of Captain King's
undescribed plants to make me recollect it.' Could a better reason be
given, if I had been asked, by me, for not giving the plants to the
British Museum?") and the Zoologists so little; the proportional number
of specimens in the two branches should have had a very different
appearance. I am out of patience with the Zoologists, not because they
are overworked, but for their mean, quarrelsome spirit. I went the other
evening to the Zoological Society, where the speakers were snarling
at each other in a manner anything but like that of gentlemen. Thank
Heavens! as long as I remain in Cambridge there will not be any danger
of falling into any such contemptible quarrels, whilst in London I do
not see how it is to be avoided. Of the Naturalists, F. Hope is out of
London; Westwood I have not seen, so about my insects I know nothing.
I have seen Mr. Yarrell twice, but he is so evidently oppressed with
business that it is too selfish to plague him with my concerns. He has
asked me to dine with the Linnean on Tuesday, and on Wednesday I dine
with the Geological, so that I shall see all the great men. Mr. Bell,
I hear, is so much occupied that there is no chance of his wishing for
specimens of reptiles. I have forgotten to mention Mr. Lonsdale (William
Lonsdale, 1794-1871, was originally in the army, and served at the
battles of Salamanca and Waterloo. After the war he left the service
and gave himself up to science. He acted as assistant secretary to
the Geological Society from 1829-42, when he resigned, owing to ill
health.), who gave me a most cordial reception, and with whom I had
much most interesting conversation. If I was not much more inclined
for geology than the other branches of Natural History, I am sure Mr.
Lyell's and Lonsdale's kindness ought to fix me. You cannot conceive
anything more thoroughly good-natured than the heart-and-soul manner in
which he put himself in my place and thought what would be best to do.
At first he was all for London versus Cambridge, but at last I made him
confess that, for some time at least, the latter would be for me
much the best. There is not another soul whom I could ask, excepting
yourself, to wade through and criticise some of those papers which I
have left with you. Mr. Lyell owned that, second to London, there was no
place in England so good for a Naturalist as Cambridge. Upon my word
I am ashamed of writing so many foolish details, no young lady ever
described her first ball with more particularity."

A few days later he writes more cheerfully: "I became acquainted with
Mr. Bell (T. Bell, F.R.S., formerly Prof. of Zoology in King's College,
London, and some time secretary to the Royal Society. He afterwards
described the reptiles for the zoology of the voyage of the "Beagle".)
who to my surprise expressed a good deal of interest about my crustacea
and reptiles, and seems willing to work at them. I also heard that Mr.
Broderip would be glad to look over the South American shells, so that
things flourish well with me."

About his plants he writes with characteristic openness as to his own
ignorance: "You have made me known amongst the botanists, but I felt
very foolish when Mr. Don remarked on the beautiful appearance of some
plant with an astounding long name, and asked me about its habitation.
Some one else seemed quite surprised that I knew nothing about a Carex
from I do not know where. I was at last forced to plead most entire
innocence, and that I knew no more about the plants which I had
collected than the man in the moon."

As to part of his Geological Collection he was soon able to write:
"I [have] disposed of the most important part [of] my collections, by
giving all the fossil bones to the College of Surgeons, casts of them
will be distributed, and descriptions published. They are very curious
and valuable; one head belonged to some gnawing animal, but of the size
of a Hippopotamus! Another to an ant-eater of the size of a horse!"

It is worth noting that at this time the only extinct mammalia from
South America, which had been described, were Mastodon (three species)
and Megatherium. The remains of the other extinct Edentata from Sir
Woodbine Parish's collection had not been described. My father's
specimens included (besides the above-mentioned Toxodon and
Scelidotherium) the remains of Mylodon, Glossotherium, another gigantic
animal allied to the ant-eater, and Macrauchenia. His discovery of
these remains is a matter of interest in itself, but it has a special
importance as a point in his own life, since it was the vivid impression
produced by excavating them with his own hands (I have often heard
him speak of the despair with which he had to break off the projecting
extremity of a huge, partly excavated bone, when the boat waiting for
him would wait no longer.) that formed one of the chief starting-points
of his speculation on the origin of species. This is shown in the
following extract from his Pocket Book for this year (1837): "In July
opened first note-book on Transmutation of Species. Had been greatly
struck from about the month of previous March on character of South
American fossils, and species on Galapagos Archipelago. These facts
(especially latter), origin of all my views."]


1836-1837.

CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. 43 Great Marlborough Street, November 6th
[1836].

My dear Fox,

I have taken a shamefully long time in answering your letter. But the
busiest time of the whole voyage has been tranquillity itself to this
last month. After paying Henslow a short but very pleasant visit, I came
up to town to wait for the "Beagle's" arrival. At last I have removed
all my property from on board, and sent the specimens of Natural History
to Cambridge, so that I am now a free man. My London visit has been
quite idle as far as Natural History goes, but has been passed in
most exciting dissipation amongst the Dons in science. All my affairs,
indeed, are most prosperous; I find there are plenty who will undertake
the description of whole tribes of animals, of which I know nothing. So
that about this day month I hope to set to work tooth and nail at the
Geology, which I shall publish by itself.

It is quite ridiculous what an immensely long period it appears to me
since landing at Falmouth. The fact is I have talked and laughed enough
for years instead of weeks, so [that] my memory is quite confounded with
the noise. I am delighted to hear you are turned geologist: when I pay
the Isle of Wight a visit, which I am determined shall somehow come to
pass, you will be a capital cicerone to the famous line of dislocation.
I really suppose there are few parts of the world more interesting to a
geologist than your island. Amongst the great scientific men, no one
has been nearly so friendly and kind as Lyell. I have seen him several
times, and feel inclined to like him much. You cannot imagine how
good-naturedly he entered into all my plans. I speak now only of the
London men, for Henslow was just like his former self, and therefore
a most cordial and affectionate friend. When you pay London a visit I
shall be very proud to take you to the Geological Society, for be it
known, I was proposed to be a F.G.S. last Tuesday. It is, however, a
great pity that these and the other letters, especially F.R.S., are so
very expensive.

I do not scruple to ask you to write to me in a week's time in
Shrewsbury, for you are a good letter writer, and if people will have
such good characters they must pay the penalty. Good-bye, dear Fox.

Yours, C.D.


[His affairs being thus so far prosperously managed he was able to put
into execution his plan of living at Cambridge, where he settled on
December 10th, 1836. He was at first a guest in the comfortable home of
the Henslows, but afterwards, for the sake of undisturbed work, he moved
into lodgings.]

He thus writes to Fox, March 13th, 1837, from London:--

"My residence at Cambridge was rather longer than I expected, owing to
a job which I determined to finish there, namely, looking over all my
geological specimens. Cambridge yet continues a very pleasant, but not
half so merry a place as before. To walk through the courts of Christ's
College, and not know an inhabitant of a single room, gave one a feeling
half melancholy. The only evil I found in Cambridge was its being too
pleasant: there was some agreeable party or another every evening, and
one cannot say one is engaged with so much impunity there as in this
great city."

A trifling record of my father's presence in Cambridge occurs in the
book kept in Christ's College combination-room, where fines and bets
were recorded, the earlier entries giving a curious impression of the
after-dinner frame of mind of the fellows. The bets were not allowed to
be made in money, but were, like the fines, paid in wine. The bet which
my father made and lost is thus recorded:--

"FEBRUARY 23, 1837."

Mr. Darwin v. Mr. Baines, that the combination-room measures from the
ceiling to the floor more than (x) feet. 1 Bottle paid same day.

"N.B. Mr. Darwin may measure at any part of the room he pleases."

Besides arranging the geological and mineralogical specimens, he had
his 'Journal of Researches' to work at, which occupied his evenings at
Cambridge. He also read a short paper at the Zoological Society ("Notes
upon Rhea Americana," 'Zool. Soc. Proc.' v. 1837, pages 35, 36.), and
another at the Geological Society ('Geol. Soc. Proc.' ii. 1838, pages
446- 449.), on the recent elevation of the coast of Chile.

Early in the spring of 1837 (March 6th) he left Cambridge for London,
and a week later he was settled in lodgings at 36 Great Marlborough
Street; and except for a "short visit to Shrewsbury" in June, he worked
on till September, being almost entirely employed on his 'Journal.'
He found time, however, for two papers at the Geological Society. ("A
sketch of the deposits containing extinct mammalia in the neighbourhood
of the Plata," 'Geol. Soc. Proc.' ii. 1838, pages 542-544; and "On
certain areas of elevation and subsidence in the Pacific and Indian
oceans, as deduced from the study of coral formations." 'Geol. Soc.
Proc' ii. 1838, pages 552- 554.)

He writes of his work to Fox (March, 1837):--

"In your last letter you urge me to get ready THE book. I am now hard at
work and give up everything else for it. Our plan is as follows: Captain
Fitz-Roy writes two volumes out of the materials collected during
the last voyage under Capt. King to Tierra del Fuego, and during our
circumnavigation. I am to have the third volume, in which I intend
giving a kind of journal of a naturalist, not following, however, always
the order of time, but rather the order of position. The habits of
animals will occupy a large portion, sketches of the geology,
the appearance of the country, and personal details will make the
hodge-podge complete. Afterwards I shall write an account of the geology
in detail, and draw up some zoological papers. So that I have plenty of
work for the next year or two, and till that is finished I will have no
holidays."

Another letter to Fox (July) gives an account of the progress of his
work:--

"I gave myself a holiday and a visit to Shrewsbury [in June], as I had
finished my Journal. I shall now be very busy in filling up gaps and
getting it quite ready for the press by the first of August. I shall
always feel respect for every one who has written a book, let it be what
it may, for I had no idea of the trouble which trying to write common
English could cost one. And, alas, there yet remains the worst part of
all, correcting the press. As soon as ever that is done I must put my
shoulder to the wheel and commence at the Geology. I have read some
short papers to the Geological Society, and they were favourably
received by the great guns, and this gives me much confidence, and I
hope not a very great deal of vanity, though I confess I feel too often
like a peacock admiring his tail. I never expected that my Geology would
ever have been worth the consideration of such men as Lyell, who has
been to me, since my return, a most active friend. My life is a very
busy one at present, and I hope may ever remain so; though Heaven knows
there are many serious drawbacks to such a life, and chief amongst them
is the little time it allows one for seeing one's natural friends. For
the last three years, I have been longing and longing to be living at
Shrewsbury, and after all now in the course of several months, I see
my dear good people at Shrewsbury for a week. Susan and Catherine have,
however, been staying with my brother here for some weeks, but they had
returned home before my visit."

[Besides the work already mentioned he had much to busy him in making
arrangements for the publication of the 'Zoology of the Voyage of the
"Beagle".' The following letters illustrate this subject.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS. (Now Rev L. Blomefield.) 36 Great
Marlborough Street, April 10th, 1837.

Dear Jenyns,

During the last week several of the zoologists of this place have been
urging me to consider the possibility of publishing the 'Zoology of
the "Beagle's" Voyage' on some uniform plan. Mr. Macleay (William Sharp
Macleay was the son of Alexander Macleay, formerly Colonial Secretary
of New South Wales, and for many years Secretary of the Linnean Society.)
The son, who was a most zealous Naturalist, and had inherited from his
father a very large general collection of insects, made Entomology his
chief study, and gained great notoriety by his now forgotten "Quinary
System", set forth in the Second Part of his 'Horae Entomologicae,'
published in 1821.--[I am indebted to Rev. L. Blomefield for the
foregoing note.] has taken a great deal of interest in the subject, and
maintains that such a publication is very desirable, because it keeps
together a series of observations made respecting animals inhabiting the
same part of the world, and allows any future traveller taking them with
him. How far this facility of reference is of any consequence I am very
doubtful; but if such is the case, it would be more satisfactory to
myself to see the gleanings of my hands, after having passed through the
brains of other naturalists, collected together in one work. But such
considerations ought not to have much weight. The whole scheme is at
present merely floating in the air; but I was determined to let you
know, as I should much like to know what you think about it, and whether
you would object to supply descriptions of the fish to such a
work instead of to 'Transactions.' I apprehend the whole will be
impracticable, without Government will aid in engraving the plates, and
this I fear is a mere chance, only I think I can put in a strong claim,
and get myself well backed by the naturalists of this place, who nearly
all take a good deal of interest in my collections. I mean to-morrow
to see Mr. Yarrell; if he approves, I shall begin and take more active
steps; for I hear he is most prudent and most wise. It is scarcely any
use speculating about any plan, but I thought of getting subscribers and
publishing the work in parts (as long as funds would last, for I myself
will not lose money by it). In such case, whoever had his own part ready
on any order might publish it separately (and ultimately the parts might
be sold separately), so that no one should be delayed by the other. The
plan would resemble, on a humble scale, Ruppel's 'Atlas,' or Humboldt's
'Zoologie,' where Latreille, Cuvier, etc., wrote different parts. I
myself should have little to do with it; excepting in some orders
adding habits and ranges, etc., and geographical sketches, and perhaps
afterwards some descriptions of invertebrate animals...

I am working at my Journal; it gets on slowly, though I am not idle. I
thought Cambridge a bad place from good dinners and other temptations,
but I find London no better, and I fear it may grow worse. I have a
capital friend in Lyell, and see a great deal of him, which is very
advantageous to me in discussing much South American geology. I miss a
walk in the country very much; this London is a vile smoky place, where
a man loses a great part of the best enjoyments in life. But I see no
chance of escaping, even for a week, from this prison for a long time
to come. I fear it will be some time before we shall meet; for I suppose
you will not come up here during the spring, and I do not think I shall
be able to go down to Cambridge. How I should like to have a good walk
along the Newmarket road to-morrow, but Oxford Street must do instead. I
do hate the streets of London. Will you tell Henslow to be careful with
the EDIBLE fungi from Tierra del Fuego, for I shall want some specimens
for Mr. Brown, who seems PARTICULARLY interested about them. Tell
Henslow, I think my silicified wood has unflintified Mr. Brown's heart,
for he was very gracious to me, and talked about the Galapagos plants;
but before he never would say a word. It is just striking twelve
o'clock; so I will wish you a very good night.

My dear Jenyns, Yours most truly, CHARLES DARWIN.

[A few weeks later the plan seems to have been matured, and the idea of
seeking Government aid to have been adopted.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. 36 Great Marlborough Street, [18th May,
1837].

My dear Henslow,

I was very glad to receive your letter. I wanted much to hear how you
were getting on with your manifold labours. Indeed I do not wonder your
head began to ache; it is almost a wonder you have any head left. Your
account of the Gamlingay expedition was cruelly tempting, but I cannot
anyhow leave London. I wanted to pay my good, dear people at Shrewsbury
a visit of a few days, but I found I could not manage it; at present I
am waiting for the signatures of the Duke of Somerset, as President of
the Linnean, and of Lord Derby and Whewell, to a statement of the value
of my collection; the instant I get this I shall apply to Government for
assistance in engraving, and so publish the 'Zoology' on some uniform
plan. It is quite ridiculous the time any operation requires which
depends on many people.

I have been working very steadily, but have only got two-thirds through
the Journal part alone. I find, though I remain daily many hours at
work, the progress is very slow: it is an awful thing to say to oneself,
every fool and every clever man in England, if he chooses, may make as
many ill-natured remarks as he likes on this unfortunate sentence....


In August he writes to Henslow to announce the success of the scheme
for the publication of the 'Zoology of the Voyage of the "Beagle",'
through the promise of a grant of 1000 pounds from the Treasury: "I
have delayed writing to you, to thank you most sincerely for having so
effectually managed my affair. I waited till I had an interview with the
Chancellor of the Exchequer (T. Spring Rice.). He appointed to see me
this morning, and I had a long conversation with him, Mr. Peacock being
present. Nothing could be more thoroughly obliging and kind than his
whole manner. He made no sort of restriction, but only told me to make
the most of [the] money, which of course I am right willing to do.

"I expected rather an awful interview, but I never found anything less
so in my life. It will be my fault if I do not make a good work; but I
sometimes take an awful fright that I have not materials enough. It will
be excessively satisfactory at the end of some two years to find all
materials made the most they were capable of."

Later in the autumn he wrote to Henslow: "I have not been very well of
late, with an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart, and my doctors
urge me STRONGLY to knock off all work, and go and live in the country
for a few weeks." He accordingly took a holiday of about a month at
Shrewsbury and Maer, and paid a visit in the Isle of Wight. It was, I
believe, during this visit, at Mr. Wedgwood's house at Maer, that he
made his first observations on the work done by earthworms, and late
in the autumn he read a paper on the subject at the Geological Society.
("On the formation of mould," 'Geol. Soc. Proc.' ii. 1838, pages
574-576.) During these two months he was also busy preparing the scheme
of the 'Zoology of the Voyage of the "Beagle",' and in beginning to put
together the Geological results of his travels.

The following letter refers to the proposal that he should take the
Secretaryship of the Geological Society.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. October 14th, [1837].

My dear Henslow,

...I am much obliged to you for your message about the Secretaryship. I
am exceedingly anxious for you to hear my side of the question, and will
you be so kind as afterwards to give me your fair judgment. The subject
has haunted me all summer. I am unwilling to undertake the office for
the following reasons: First, my entire ignorance of English Geology, a
knowledge of which would be almost necessary in order to shorten many
of the papers before reading them before the Society, or rather to
know what parts to skip. Again, my ignorance of all languages, and
not knowing how to pronounce a SINGLE word of French--a language so
perpetually quoted. It would be disgraceful to the Society to have a
Secretary who could not read French. Secondly, the loss of time; pray
consider that I should have to look after the artists, superintend and
furnish materials for the Government work, which will come out in parts,
and which must appear regularly. All my Geological notes are in a very
rough state; none of my fossil shells worked up; and I have much to
read. I have had hopes, by giving up society and not wasting an hour,
that I should finish my Geology in a year and a half, by which time the
description of the higher animals by others would be completed, and my
whole time would then necessarily be required to complete myself
the description of the invertebrate ones. If this plan fails, as the
Government work must go on, the Geology would necessarily be deferred
till probably at least three years from this time. In the present state
of the science, a great part of the utility of the little I have done
would be lost, and all freshness and pleasure quite taken from me.

I know from experience the time required to make abstracts EVEN of my
own papers for the 'Proceedings.' If I was Secretary, and had to make
double abstracts of each paper, studying them before reading, and
attendance would AT LEAST cost me three days (and often more) in the
fortnight. There are likewise other accidental and contingent losses of
time; I know Dr. Royle found the office consumed much of his time. If by
merely giving up any amusement, or by working harder than I have done,
I could save time, I would undertake the Secretaryship; but I appeal to
you whether, with my slow manner of writing, with two works in hand, and
with the certainty, if I cannot complete the Geological part within
a fixed period, that its publication must be retarded for a very long
time,--whether any Society whatever has any claim on me for three days'
disagreeable work every fortnight. I cannot agree that it is a duty on
my part, as a follower of science, as long as I devote myself to the
completion of the work I have in hand, to delay that, by undertaking
what may be done by any person who happens to have more spare time than
I have at present. Moreover, so early in my scientific life, with
so very much as I have to learn, the office, though no doubt a great
honour, etc., for me, would be the more burdensome. Mr. Whewell (I know
very well), judging from himself, will think I exaggerate the time the
Secretaryship would require; but I absolutely know the time which with
me the simplest writing consumes. I do not at all like appearing so
selfish as to refuse Mr. Whewell, more especially as he has always
shown, in the kindest manner, an interest in my affairs. But I cannot
look forward with even tolerable comfort to undertaking an office
without entering on it heart and soul, and that would be impossible with
the Government work and the Geology in hand.

My last objection is, that I doubt how far my health will stand the
confinement of what I have to do, without any additional work. I merely
repeat, that you may know I am not speaking idly, that when I consulted
Dr. Clark in town, he at first urged me to give up entirely all writing
and even correcting press for some weeks. Of late anything which
flurries me completely knocks me up afterwards, and brings on a violent
palpitation of the heart. Now the Secretaryship would be a periodical
source of more annoying trouble to me than all the rest of the fortnight
put together. In fact, till I return to town, and see how I get on, if
I wished the office ever so much, I COULD not say I would positively
undertake it. I beg of you to excuse this very long prose all about
myself, but the point is one of great interest. I can neither bear to
think myself very selfish and sulky, nor can I see the possibility of my
taking the Secretaryship without making a sacrifice of all my plans and
a good deal of comfort.

If you see Whewell, would you tell him the substance of this letter; or,
if he will take the trouble, he may read it. My dear Henslow, I appeal
to you in loco parentis. Pray tell me what you think? But do not judge
me by the activity of mind which you and a few others possess, for in
that case the more difficult things in hand the pleasanter the work;
but, though I hope I never shall be idle, such is not the case with me.

Ever, dear Henslow, Yours most truly, C. DARWIN.

[He ultimately accepted the post, and held it for three years--from
February 16, 1838, to February 19, 1841.

After being assured of the Grant for the publication of the 'Zoology of
the Voyage of the "Beagle",' there was much to be done in arranging the
scheme of publication, and this occupied him during part of October and
November.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. [4th November, 1837.]

My dear Henslow,

...Pray tell Leonard (Rev. L. Jenyns.) that my Government work is
going on smoothly, and I hope will be prosperous. He will see in the
Prospectus his name attached to the fish; I set my shoulders to the
work with a good heart. I am very much better than I was during the
last month before my Shrewsbury visit. I fear the Geology will take me
a great deal of time; I was looking over one set of notes, and the
quantity I found I had to read, for that one place was frightful. If I
live till I am eighty years old I shall not cease to marvel at finding
myself an author; in the summer before I started, if any one had told me
that I should have been an angel by this time, I should have thought it
an equal impossibility. This marvellous transformation is all owing to
you.

I am sorry to find that a good many errata are left in the part of my
volume, which is printed. During my absence Mr. Colburn employed some
goose to revise, and he has multiplied, instead of diminishing my
oversights; but for all that, the smooth paper and clear type has
a charming appearance, and I sat the other evening gazing in silent
admiration at the first page of my own volume, when I received it from
the printers!

Good-bye, my dear Henslow, C. DARWIN.


1838.

[From the beginning of this year to nearly the end of June, he was
busily employed on the zoological and geological results of his voyage.
This spell of work was interrupted only by a visit of three days to
Cambridge, in May; and even this short holiday was taken in consequence
of failing health, as we may assume from the entry in his diary: "May
1st, unwell," and from a letter to his sister (May 16, 1838), when he
wrote:--

"My trip of three days to Cambridge has done me such wonderful good, and
filled my limbs with such elasticity, that I must get a little work
out of my body before another holiday." This holiday seems to have been
thoroughly enjoyed; he wrote to his sister:--

"Now for Cambridge: I stayed at Henslow's house and enjoyed my visit
extremely. My friends gave me a most cordial welcome. Indeed, I was
quite a lion there. Mrs. Henslow unfortunately was obliged to go on
Friday for a visit in the country. That evening we had at Henslow's a
brilliant party of all the geniuses in Cambridge, and a most remarkable
set of men they most assuredly are. On Saturday I rode over to L.
Jenyns', and spent the morning with him. I found him very cheerful, but
bitterly complaining of his solitude. On Saturday evening dined at one
of the Colleges, played at bowls on the College Green after dinner,
and was deafened with nightingales singing. Sunday, dined in Trinity;
capital dinner, and was very glad to sit by Professor Lee (Samuel
Lee, of Queens', was Professor of Arabic from 1819 to 1831, and Regius
Professor of Hebrew from 1831 to 1848.)...; I find him a very pleasant
chatting man, and in high spirits like a boy, at having lately returned
from a living or a curacy, for seven years in Somersetshire, to
civilised society and oriental manuscripts. He had exchanged his living
to one within fourteen miles of Cambridge, and seemed perfectly happy.
In the evening attended Trinity Chapel, and heard 'The Heavens are
telling the Glory of God,' in magnificent style; the last chorus seemed
to shake the very walls of the College. After chapel a large party in
Sedgwick's rooms. So much for my Annals."

He started, towards the end of June, on his expedition to Glen Roy, of
which he writes to Fox: "I have not been very well of late, which has
suddenly determined me to leave London earlier than I had anticipated. I
go by the steam-packet to Edinburgh,--take a solitary walk on Salisbury
Craigs, and call up old thoughts of former times, then go on to Glasgow
and the great valley of Inverness, near which I intend stopping a week
to geologise the parallel roads of Glen Roy, thence to Shrewsbury, Maer
for one day, and London for smoke, ill-health and hard work."

He spent "eight good days" over the Parallel Roads. His Essay on this
subject was written out during the same summer, and published by the
Royal Society. ('Phil. Trans.' 1839, pages 39-82.) He wrote in his
Pocket Book: "September 6 [1838]. Finished the paper on 'Glen Roy,' one
of the most difficult and instructive tasks I was ever engaged on." It
will be remembered that in his 'Recollections' he speaks of this paper
as a failure, of which he was ashamed.

At the time at which he wrote, the latest theory of the formation of
the Parallel Roads was that of Sir Lauder Dick and Dr. Macculloch, who
believed that lakes had anciently existed in Glen Roy, caused by dams
of rock or alluvium. In arguing against this theory he conceived that he
had disproved the admissibility of any lake theory, but in this point
he was mistaken. He wrote (Glen Roy paper, page 49) "the conclusion is
inevitable, that no hypothesis founded on the supposed existence of a
sheet of water confined by BARRIERS, that is a lake, can be admitted as
solving the problematical origin of the parallel roads of Lochaber."

Mr. Archibald Geikie has been so good as to allow me to quote a passage
from a letter addressed to me (November 19, 1884) in compliance with my
request for his opinion on the character of my father's Glen Roy work:--

"Mr. Darwin's 'Glen Roy' paper, I need not say, is marked by all his
characteristic acuteness of observation and determination to consider
all possible objections. It is a curious example, however, of the danger
of reasoning by a method of exclusion in Natural Science. Finding that
the waters which formed the terraces in the Glen Roy region could not
possibly have been dammed back by barriers of rock or of detritus, he
saw no alternative but to regard them as the work of the sea. Had the
idea of transient barriers of glacier-ice occurred to him, he would have
found the difficulties vanish from the lake-theory which he opposed,
and he would not have been unconsciously led to minimise the altogether
overwhelming objections to the supposition that the terraces are of
marine origin."

It may be added that the idea of the barriers being formed by glaciers
could hardly have occurred to him, considering what was the state of
knowledge at the time, and bearing in mind his want of opportunities of
observing glacial action on a large scale.

The latter half of July was passed at Shrewsbury and Maer. The only
entry of any interest is one of being "very idle" at Shrewsbury, and of
opening "a note-book connected with metaphysical inquiries." In August
he records that he read "a good deal of various amusing books, and paid
some attention to metaphysical subjects."

The work done during the remainder of the year comprises the book
on coral reefs (begun in October), and some work on the phenomena of
elevation in S. America.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. 36 Great Marlborough Street, August 9th
[1838].

My dear Lyell,

I do not write to you at Norwich, for I thought I should have more to
say, if I waited a few more days. Very many thanks for the present of
your 'Elements,' which I received (and I believe the VERY FIRST copy
distributed) together with your note. I have read it through every word,
and am full of admiration of it, and, as I now see no geologist, I must
talk to you about it. There is no pleasure in reading a book if one
cannot have a good talk over it; I repeat, I am full of admiration
of it, it is as clear as daylight, in fact I felt in many parts some
mortification at thinking how geologists have laboured and struggled at
proving what seems, as you have put it, so evidently probable. I read
with much interest your sketch of the secondary deposits; you have
contrived to make it quite "juicy," as we used to say as children of a
good story. There was also much new to me, and I have to copy out some
fifty notes and references. It must do good, the heretics against common
sense must yield...By the way, do you recollect my telling you how much
I disliked the manner -- referred to his other works, as much as to say,
"You must, ought, and shall buy everything I have written." To my mind,
you have somehow quite avoided this; your references only seem to say,
"I can't tell you all in this work, else I would, so you must go to the
'Principles'"; and many a one, I trust, you will send there, and make
them, like me, adorers of the good science of rock-breaking. You will
see I am in a fit of enthusiasm, and good cause I have to be, when I
find you have made such infinitely more use of my Journal than I could
have anticipated. I will say no more about the book, for it is all
praise. I must, however, admire the elaborate honesty with which you
quote the words of all living and dead geologists.

My Scotch expedition answered brilliantly; my trip in the steam-packet
was absolutely pleasant, and I enjoyed the spectacle, wretch that I am,
of two ladies, and some small children quite sea-sick, I being well.
Moreover, on my return from Glasgow to Liverpool, I triumphed in a
similar manner over some full-grown men. I stayed one whole day in
Edinburgh, or more truly on Salisbury Craigs; I want to hear some day
what you think about that classical ground,--the structure was to me new
and rather curious,--that is, if I understand it right. I crossed from
Edinburgh in gigs and carts (and carts without springs, as I never shall
forget) to Loch Leven. I was disappointed in the scenery, and reached
Glen Roy on Saturday evening, one week after leaving Marlborough Street.
Here I enjoyed five [?] days of the most beautiful weather with gorgeous
sunsets, and all nature looking as happy as I felt. I wandered over
the mountains in all directions, and examined that most extraordinary
district. I think, without any exceptions, not even the first volcanic
island, the first elevated beach, or the passage of the Cordillera, was
so interesting to me as this week. It is far the most remarkable area
I ever examined. I have fully convinced myself (after some doubting at
first) that the shelves are sea-beaches, although I could not find a
trace of a shell; and I think I can explain away most, if not all, the
difficulties. I found a piece of a road in another valley, not hitherto
observed, which is important; and I have some curious facts about
erratic blocks, one of which was perched up on a peak 2200 feet above
the sea. I am now employed in writing a paper on the subject, which I
find very amusing work, excepting that I cannot anyhow condense it into
reasonable limits. At some future day I hope to talk over some of the
conclusions with you, which the examination of Glen Roy has led me to.
Now I have had my talk out, I am much easier, for I can assure you Glen
Roy has astonished me.

I am living very quietly, and therefore pleasantly, and am crawling on
slowly but steadily with my work. I have come to one conclusion,
which you will think proves me to be a very sensible man, namely, that
whatever you say proves right; and as a proof of this, I am coming into
your way of only working about two hours at a spell; I then go out and
do my business in the streets, return and set to work again, and thus
make two separate days out of one. The new plan answers capitally; after
the second half day is finished I go and dine at the Athenaeum like a
gentleman, or rather like a lord, for I am sure the first evening I sat
in that great drawing-room, all on a sofa by myself, I felt just like a
duke. I am full of admiration at the Athenaeum, one meets so many people
there that one likes to see. The very first time I dined there (i.e.
last week) I met Dr. Fitton (W.H. Fitton (1780-1861) was a physician
and geologist, and sometime president of the Geological Society. He
established the 'Proceedings,' a mode of publication afterwards
adopted by other societies.) at the door, and he got together quite a
party--Robert Brown, who is gone to Paris and Auvergne, Macleay [?] and
Dr. Boott. (Francis Boott (1792-1863) is chiefly known as a botanist
through his work on the genus Carex. He was also well-known in
connection with the Linnean Society of which he was for many years an
office-bearer. He is described (in a biographical sketch published
in the "Gardener's Chronicle", 1864) as having been one of the first
physicians in London who gave up the customary black coat, knee-breeches
and silk stockings, and adopted the ordinary dress of the period, a
blue coat with brass buttons, and a buff waiscoat, a costume which he
continued to wear to the last. After giving up practice, which he
did early in life, he spent much of his time in acts of unpretending
philanthropy.) Your helping me into the Athenaeum has not been thrown
away, and I enjoy it the more because I fully expected to detest it.

I am writing you a most unmerciful letter, but I shall get Owen to take
it to Newcastle. If you have a mind to be a very generous man you will
write to me from Kinnordy (The house of Lyell's father.), and tell me
some Newcastle news, as well as about the Craig, and about yourself and
Mrs. Lyell, and everything else in the world. I will send by Hall the
'Entomological Transactions,' which I have borrowed for you; you will be
disappointed in --'s papers, that is if you suppose my dear friend has
a single clear idea upon any one subject. He has so involved recent
insects and true fossil insects in one table that I fear you will not
make much out of it, though it is a subject which ought I should
think to come into the 'Principles.' You will be amused at some of the
ridiculo-sublime passages in the papers, and no doubt will feel acutely
a sneer there is at yourself. I have heard from more than one quarter
that quarrelling is expected at Newcastle (At the meeting of the British
Association.); I am sorry to hear it. I met old -- this evening at the
Athenaeum, and he muttered something about writing to you or some one on
the subject; I am however all in the dark. I suppose, however, I shall
be illuminated, for I am going to dine with him in a few days, as my
inventive powers failed in making any excuse. A friend of mine dined
with him the other day, a party of four, and they finished ten bottles
of wine--a pleasant prospect for me; but I am determined not even to
taste his wine, partly for the fun of seeing his infinite disgust and
surprise...

I pity you the infliction of this most unmerciful letter. Pray remember
me most kindly to Mrs. Lyell when you arrive at Kinnordy. I saw her name
in the landlord's book of Inverorum. Tell Mrs. Lyell to read the
second series of 'Mr. Slick of Slickville's Sayings.'...He almost beats
"Samivel," that prince of heroes. Goodnight, my dear Lyell; you will
think I have been drinking some strong drink to write so much nonsense,
but I did not even taste Minerva's small beer to-day.

Yours most sincerely, CHAS. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Friday night, September 13th [1838].

My dear Lyell,

I was astonished and delighted at your gloriously long letter, and I am
sure I am very much obliged to Mrs. Lyell for having taken the trouble
to write so much. (Lyell dictated much of his correspondence.) I mean to
have a good hour's enjoyment and scribble away to you, who have so much
geological sympathy that I do not care how egotistically I write...

I have got so much to say about all sorts of trifling things that I
hardly know what to begin about. I need not say how pleased I am to hear
that Mr. Lyell (Father of the geologist.) likes my Journal. To hear
such tidings is a kind of resurrection, for I feel towards my first-born
child as if it had long since been dead, buried, and forgotten; but the
past is nothing and the future everything to us geologists, as you show
in your capital motto to the 'Elements.' By the way, have you read
the article, in the 'Edinburgh Review,' on M. Comte, 'Cours de la
Philosophie' (or some such title)? It is capital; there are some fine
sentences about the very essence of science being prediction, which
reminded me of "its law being progress."

I will now begin and go through your letter seriatim. I dare say your
plan of putting the Elie de Beaumont's chapter separately and early will
be very good; anyhow, it is showing a bold front in the first edition
which is to be translated into French. It will be a curious point to
geologists hereafter to note how long a man's name will support a theory
so completely exposed as that of De Beaumont's has been by you; you
say you "begin to hope that the great principles there insisted on will
stand the test of time." BEGIN TO HOPE: why, the POSSIBILITY of a
doubt has never crossed my mind for many a day. This may be very
unphilosophical, but my geological salvation is staked on it. After
having just come back from Glen Roy, and found how difficulties smooth
away under your principles, it makes me quite indignant that you should
talk of HOPING. With respect to the question, how far my coral theory
bears on De Beaumont's theory, I think it would be prudent to quote me
with great caution until my whole account is published, and then
you (and others) can judge how far there is foundation for such
generalisation. Mind, I do not doubt its truth; but the extension of
any view over such large spaces, from comparatively few facts, must be
received with much caution. I do not myself the least doubt that
within the recent (or as you, much to my annoyment, would call it, "New
Pliocene") period, tortuous bands--not all the bands parallel to each
other--have been elevated and corresponding ones subsided, though within
the same period some parts probably remained for a time stationary, or
even subsided. I do not believe a more utterly false view could have
been invented than great straight lines being suddenly thrown up.

When my book on Volcanoes and Coral Reefs will be published I hardly
know; I fear it will be at least four or five months; though, mind,
the greater part is written. I find so much time is lost in correcting
details and ascertaining their accuracy. The Government Zoological work
is a millstone round my neck, and the Glen Roy paper has lost me six
weeks. I will not, however, say lost; for, supposing I can prove to
others' satisfaction what I have convinced myself is the case, the
inference I think you will allow to be important. I cannot doubt that
the molten matter beneath the earth's crust possesses a high degree of
fluidity, almost like the sea beneath the block ice. By the way, I hope
you will give me some Swedish case to quote, of shells being preserved
on the surface, but not in contemporaneous beds of gravel...

Remember what I have often heard you say: the country is very bad
for the intellects; the Scotch mists will put out some volcanic
speculations. You see I am affecting to become very Cockneyfied, and to
despise the poor country-folk, who breath fresh air instead of smoke,
and see the goodly fields instead of the brick houses in Marlborough
Street, the very sight of which I confess I abhor. I am glad to hear
what a favourable report you give of the British Association. I am the
more pleased because I have been fighting its battles with Basil Hall,
Stokes, and several others, having made up my mind, from the report in
the "Athenaeum", that it must have been an excellent meeting. I have
been much amused with an account I have received of the wars of Don
Roderick (Murchison.) and Babbage. What a grievous pity it is that the
latter should be so implacable...This is a most rigmarole letter, for
after each sentence I take breath, and you will have need of it in
reading it...

I wish with all my heart that my Geological book was out. I have every
motive to work hard, and will, following your steps, work just that
degree of hardness to keep well. I should like my volume to be out
before your new edition of 'Principles' appears. Besides the Coral
theory, the volcanic chapters will, I think, contain some new facts.
I have lately been sadly tempted to be idle--that is, as far as pure
geology is concerned--by the delightful number of new views which
have been coming in thickly and steadily,--on the classification and
affinities and instincts of animals--bearing on the question of species.
Note-book after note-book has been filled with facts which begin to
group themselves CLEARLY under sub-laws.

Good night, my dear Lyell. I have filled my letter and enjoyed my talk
to you as much as I can without having you in propria persona. Think of
the bad effects of the country--so once more good night.

Ever yours, CHAS. DARWIN.

Pray again give my best thanks to Mrs. Lyell.


[The record of what he wrote during the year does not give a true index
of the most important work that was in progress,--the laying of the
foundation-stones of what was to be the achievement of his life. This is
shown in the foregoing letter to Lyell, where he speaks of being "idle,"
and the following extract from a letter to Fox, written in June, is of
interest in this point of view:

"I am delighted to hear you are such a good man as not to have forgotten
my questions about the crossing of animals. It is my prime hobby, and
I really think some day I shall be able to do something in that most
intricate subject, species and varieties."]


1839-1841.

[In the winter of 1839 (January 29) my father was married to his cousin,
Emma Wedgwood. (Daughter of Josiah Wedgwood of Maer, and grand-daughter
of the founder of the Etruria Pottery Works.) The house in which they
lived for the first few years of their married life, No. 12 Upper Gower
Street, was a small common-place London house, with a drawing-room in
front, and a small room behind, in which they lived for the sake of
quietness. In later years my father used to laugh over the surpassing
ugliness of the furniture, carpets, etc., of the Gower Street house. The
only redeeming feature was a better garden than most London houses have,
a strip as wide as the house, and thirty yards long. Even this small
space of dingy grass made their London house more tolerable to its two
country-bred inhabitants.

Of his life in London he writes to Fox (October 1839): "We are living
a life of extreme quietness; Delamere itself, which you describe as so
secluded a spot, is, I will answer for it, quite dissipated compared
with Gower Street. We have given up all parties, for they agree with
neither of us; and if one is quiet in London, there is nothing like
its quietness--there is a grandeur about its smoky fogs, and the dull
distant sounds of cabs and coaches; in fact you may perceive I am
becoming a thorough-paced Cockney, and I glory in thoughts that I shall
be here for the next six months."

The entries of ill health in the Diary increase in number during
these years, and as a consequence the holidays become longer and more
frequent. From April 26 to May 13, 1839, he was at Maer and Shrewsbury.
Again, from August 23 to October 2 he was away from London at
Maer, Shrewsbury, and at Birmingham for the meeting of the British
Association.

The entry under August 1839 is: "During my visit to Maer, read a little,
was much unwell and scandalously idle. I have derived this much good,
that NOTHING is so intolerable as idleness."

At the end of 1839 his eldest child was born, and it was then that he
began his observations ultimately published in the 'Expression of the
Emotions.' His book on this subject, and the short paper published in
'Mind,' (July 1877.) show how closely he observed his child. He seems to
have been surprised at his own feelings for a young baby, for he wrote
to Fox (July 1840): "He [i.e. the baby] is so charming that I cannot
pretend to any modesty. I defy anybody to flatter us on our baby, for
I defy any one to say anything in its praise of which we are not fully
conscious...I had not the smallest conception there was so much in a
five-month baby. You will perceive by this that I have a fine degree of
paternal fervour."

During these years he worked intermittently at 'Coral Reefs,' being
constantly interrupted by ill health. Thus he speaks of "recommencing"
the subject in February 1839, and again in the October of the same year,
and once more in July 1841, "after more than thirteen months' interval."
His other scientific work consisted of a contribution to the Geological
Society ('Geol. Soc. Proc.' iii. 1842, and 'Geol. Soc. Trans.' vi), on
the boulders and "till" of South America, as well as a few other
minor papers on geological subjects. He also worked busily at the
ornithological part of the Zoology of the "Beagle", i.e. the notice of
the habits and ranges of the birds which were described by Gould.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Wednesday morning [February 1840].

My dear Lyell,

Many thanks for your kind note. I will send for the "Scotsman". Dr.
Holland thinks he has found out what is the matter with me, and now
hopes he shall be able to set me going again. Is it not mortifying, it
is now nine weeks since I have done a whole day's work, and not more
than four half days. But I won't grumble any more, though it is hard
work to prevent doing so. Since receiving your note I have read over my
chapter on Coral, and find I am prepared to stand by almost everything;
it is much more cautiously and accurately written than I thought. I had
set my heart upon having my volume completed before your new edition,
but not, you may believe me, for you to notice anything new in it (for
there is very little besides details), but you are the one man in Europe
whose opinion of the general truth of a toughish argument I should be
always most anxious to hear. My MS. is in such confusion, otherwise I
am sure you should most willingly if it had been worth your while, have
looked at any part you choose....

[In a letter to Fox (January 1841) he shows that his "Species work" was
still occupying his mind:--

"If you attend at all to Natural History I send you this P.S. as a
memento, that I continue to collect all kinds of facts about 'Varieties
and Species,' for my some-day work to be so entitled; the smallest
contributions thankfully accepted; descriptions of offspring of all
crosses between all domestic birds and animals, dogs, cats, etc., etc.,
very valuable. Don't forget, if your half-bred African cat should die
that I should be very much obliged for its carcase sent up in a little
hamper for the skeleton; it, or any cross-bred pigeons, fowl, duck,
etc., etc., will be more acceptable than the finest haunch of venison,
or the finest turtle."

Later in the year (September) he writes to Fox about his health, and
also with reference to his plan of moving into the country:--

"I have steadily been gaining ground, and really believe now I shall
some day be quite strong. I write daily for a couple of hours on my
Coral volume, and take a little walk or ride every day. I grow very
tired in the evenings, and am not able to go out at that time, or hardly
to receive my nearest relations; but my life ceases to be burdensome now
that I can do something. We are taking steps to leave London, and live
about twenty miles from it on some railway."]


1842.

[The record of work includes his volume on 'Coral Reefs' (A notice of
the Coral Reef work appeared in the Geograph. Soc. Journal, xii., page
115.), the manuscript of which was at last sent to the printers in
January of this year, and the last proof corrected in May. He thus
writes of the work in his diary:--

"I commenced this work three years and seven months ago. Out of this
period about twenty months (besides work during "Beagle's" voyage) has
been spent on it, and besides it, I have only compiled the Bird part of
Zoology; Appendix to Journal, paper on Boulders, and corrected papers
on Glen Roy and earthquakes, reading on species, and rest all lost by
illness."

In May and June he was at Shrewsbury and Maer, whence he went on to make
the little tour in Wales, of which he spoke in his 'Recollections,' and
of which the results were published as "Notes on the effects produced by
the ancient glaciers of Caernarvonshire, and on the Boulders transported
by floating Ice." ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842, page 352.)

Mr. Archibald Geikie speaks of this paper as standing "almost at the
top of the long list of English contributions to the history of the Ice
Age." (Charles Darwin, 'Nature' Series, page 23.)

The latter part of this year belongs to the period including the
settlement at Down, and is therefore dealt with in another chapter.]




CHAPTER 1.VIII. -- RELIGION.

[The history of this part of my father's life may justly include some
mention of his religious views. For although, as he points out, he did
not give continuous systematic thought to religious questions, yet we
know from his own words that about this time (1836-39) the subject was
much before his mind.]

In his published works he was reticent on the matter of religion,
and what he has left on the subject was not written with a view
to publication. (As an exception may be mentioned, a few words of
concurrence with Dr. Abbot's 'Truths for the Times,' which my father
allowed to be published in the "Index".)

I believe that his reticence arose from several causes. He felt
strongly that a man's religion is an essentially private matter, and
one concerning himself alone. This is indicated by the following extract
from a letter of 1879:--(Addressed to Mr. J. Fordyce, and published by
him in his 'Aspects of Scepticism,' 1883.)

"What my own views may be is a question of no consequence to any one
but myself. But, as you ask, I may state that my judgment often
fluctuates...In my most extreme fluctuations I have never been an
Atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. I think that
generally (and more and more as I grow older), but not always, that an
Agnostic would be the more correct description of my state of mind."

He naturally shrank from wounding the sensibilities of others in
religious matters, and he was also influenced by the consciousness
that a man ought not to publish on a subject to which he has not given
special and continuous thought. That he felt this caution to apply
to himself in the matter of religion is shown in a letter to Dr. F.E.
Abbot, of Cambridge, U.S. (September 6, 1871). After explaining that the
weakness arising from his bad health prevented him from feeling "equal
to deep reflection, on the deepest subject which can fill a man's mind,"
he goes on to say: "With respect to my former notes to you, I quite
forget their contents. I have to write many letters, and can reflect but
little on what I write; but I fully believe and hope that I have never
written a word, which at the time I did not think; but I think you will
agree with me, that anything which is to be given to the public ought to
be maturely weighed and cautiously put. It never occurred to me that you
would wish to print any extract from my notes: if it had, I would have
kept a copy. I put 'private' from habit, only as yet partially acquired,
from some hasty notes of mine having been printed, which were not in
the least degree worth printing, though otherwise unobjectionable. It is
simply ridiculous to suppose that my former note to you would be worth
sending to me, with any part marked which you desire to print; but
if you like to do so, I will at once say whether I should have any
objection. I feel in some degree unwilling to express myself publicly on
religious subjects, as I do not feel that I have thought deeply enough
to justify any publicity."

I may also quote from another letter to Dr. Abbot (November 16,
1871), in which my father gives more fully his reasons for not feeling
competent to write on religious and moral subjects:--

"I can say with entire truth that I feel honoured by your request that I
should become a contributor to the "Index", and am much obliged for the
draft. I fully, also, subscribe to the proposition that it is the duty
of every one to spread what he believes to be the truth; and I honour
you for doing so, with so much devotion and zeal. But I cannot comply
with your request for the following reasons; and excuse me for giving
them in some detail, as I should be very sorry to appear in your eyes
ungracious. My health is very weak: I NEVER pass 24 hours without many
hours of discomfort, when I can do nothing whatever. I have thus, also,
lost two whole consecutive months this season. Owing to this weakness,
and my head being often giddy, I am unable to master new subjects
requiring much thought, and can deal only with old materials. At no
time am I a quick thinker or writer: whatever I have done in science has
solely been by long pondering, patience and industry.

"Now I have never systematically thought much on religion in relation
to science, or on morals in relation to society; and without steadily
keeping my mind on such subjects for a LONG period, I am really
incapable of writing anything worth sending to the 'Index'."

He was more than once asked to give his views on religion, and he had,
as a rule, no objection to doing so in a private letter. Thus in answer
to a Dutch student he wrote (April 2, 1873):--

"I am sure you will excuse my writing at length, when I tell you that I
have long been much out of health, and am now staying away from my home
for rest.

"It is impossible to answer your question briefly; and I am not sure
that I could do so, even if I wrote at some length. But I may say that
the impossibility of conceiving that this grand and wondrous universe,
with our conscious selves, arose through chance, seems to me the chief
argument for the existence of God; but whether this is an argument of
real value, I have never been able to decide. I am aware that if we
admit a first cause, the mind still craves to know whence it came, and
how it arose. Nor can I overlook the difficulty from the immense amount
of suffering through the world. I am, also, induced to defer to a
certain extent to the judgment of the many able men who have fully
believed in God; but here again I see how poor an argument this is. The
safest conclusion seems to me that the whole subject is beyond the scope
of man's intellect; but man can do his duty."

Again in 1879 he was applied to by a German student, in a similar
manner. The letter was answered by a member of my father's family, who
wrote:--

"Mr. Darwin begs me to say that he receives so many letters, that he
cannot answer them all.

"He considers that the theory of Evolution is quite compatible with the
belief in a God; but that you must remember that different persons have
different definitions of what they mean by God."

This, however, did not satisfy the German youth, who again wrote to my
father, and received from him the following reply:--

"I am much engaged, an old man, and out of health, and I cannot spare
time to answer your questions fully,--nor indeed can they be answered.
Science has nothing to do with Christ, except in so far as the habit
of scientific research makes a man cautious in admitting evidence. For
myself, I do not believe that there ever has been any revelation. As
for a future life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting
vague probabilities."

The passages which here follow are extracts, somewhat abbreviated, from
a part of the Autobiography, written in 1876, in which my father gives
the history of his religious views:--

"During these two years (October 1836 to January 1839.) I was led to
think much about religion. Whilst on board the 'Beagle' I was quite
orthodox, and I remember being heartily laughed at by several of the
officers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as an
unanswerable authority on some point of morality. I suppose it was the
novelty of the argument that amused them. But I had gradually come by
this time, i.e. 1836 to 1839, to see that the Old Testament was no more
to be trusted than the sacred books of the Hindoos. The question then
continually rose before my mind and would not be banished,--is it
credible that if God were now to make a revelation to the Hindoos, he
would permit it to be connected with the belief in Vishnu, Siva, etc.,
as Christianity is connected with the Old Testament? This appeared to me
utterly incredible.

"By further reflecting that the clearest evidence would be requisite
to make any sane man believe in the miracles by which Christianity is
supported,--and that the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the
more incredible do miracles become,--that the men at that time were
ignorant and credulous to a degree almost incomprehensible by us,--that
the Gospels cannot be proved to have been written simultaneously
with the events,--that they differ in many important details, far too
important, as it seemed to me, to be admitted as the usual inaccuracies
of eye-witnesses;--by such reflections as these, which I give not
as having the least novelty or value, but as they influenced me, I
gradually came to disbelieve in Christianity as a divine revelation. The
fact that many false religions have spread over large portions of the
earth like wild-fire had some weight with me.

"But I was very unwilling to give up my belief; I feel sure of this, for
I can well remember often and often inventing day-dreams of old letters
between distinguished Romans, and manuscripts being discovered at
Pompeii or elsewhere, which confirmed in the most striking manner all
that was written in the Gospels. But I found it more and more difficult,
with free scope given to my imagination, to invent evidence which would
suffice to convince me. Thus disbelief crept over me at a very slow
rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no
distress.

"Although I did not think much about the existence of a personal God
until a considerably later period of my life, I will here give the vague
conclusions to which I have been driven. The old argument from design
in Nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive,
fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered. We
can no longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a bivalve
shell must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of
a door by man. There seems to be no more design in the variability of
organic beings, and in the action of natural selection, than in the
course which the wind blows. But I have discussed this subject at the
end of my book on the 'Variations of Domesticated Animals and Plants'
(My father asks whether we are to believe that the forms are preordained
of the broken fragments of rock tumbled from a precipice which are
fitted together by man to build his houses. If not, why should
we believe that the variations of domestic animals or plants are
preordained for the sake of the breeder? "But if we give up the
principle in one case,... no shadow of reason can be assigned for the
belief that variations, alike in nature and the result of the same
general laws, which have been the groundwork through natural selection
of the formation of the most perfectly adapted animals in the world, man
included, were intentionally and specially guided."--'The Variation of
Animals and Plants,' 1st Edition volume ii. page 431.--F.D.), and the
argument there given has never, as far as I can see, been answered.

"But passing over the endless beautiful adaptations which we everywhere
meet with, it may be asked how can the generally beneficent arrangement
of the world be accounted for? Some writers indeed are so much impressed
with the amount of suffering in the world, that they doubt, if we look
to all sentient beings, whether there is more of misery or of happiness;
whether the world as a whole is a good or bad one. According to my
judgment happiness decidedly prevails, though this would be very
difficult to prove. If the truth of this conclusion be granted, it
harmonises well with the effects which we might expect from natural
selection. If all the individuals of any species were habitually to
suffer to an extreme degree, they would neglect to propagate their kind;
but we have no reason to believe that this has ever, or at least often
occurred. Some other considerations, moreover, lead to the belief that
all sentient beings have been formed so as to enjoy, as a general rule,
happiness.

"Everyone who believes, as I do, that all the corporeal and
mental organs (excepting those which are neither advantageous nor
disadvantageous to the possessor) of all beings have been developed
through natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, together
with use or habit, will admit that these organs have been formed so that
their possessors may compete successfully with other beings, and thus
increase in number. Now an animal may be led to pursue that course of
action which is most beneficial to the species by suffering, such
as pain, hunger, thirst, and fear; or by pleasure, as in eating and
drinking, and in the propagation of the species, etc.; or by both means
combined, as in the search for food. But pain or suffering of any kind,
if long continued, causes depression and lessens the power of action,
yet is well adapted to make a creature guard itself against any great
or sudden evil. Pleasurable sensations, on the other hand, may be long
continued without any depressing effect; on the contrary, they stimulate
the whole system to increased action. Hence it has come to pass that
most or all sentient beings have been developed in such a manner,
through natural selection, that pleasurable sensations serve as their
habitual guides. We see this in the pleasure from exertion, even
occasionally from great exertion of the body or mind,--in the pleasure
of our daily meals, and especially in the pleasure derived from
sociability, and from loving our families. The sum of such pleasures as
these, which are habitual or frequently recurrent, give, as I can hardly
doubt, to most sentient beings an excess of happiness over misery,
although many occasionally suffer much. Such suffering is quite
compatible with the belief in Natural Selection, which is not perfect
in its action, but tends only to render each species as successful
as possible in the battle for life with other species, in wonderfully
complex and changing circumstances.

"That there is much suffering in the world no one disputes. Some have
attempted to explain this with reference to man by imagining that it
serves for his moral improvement. But the number of men in the world
is as nothing compared with that of all other sentient beings, and
they often suffer greatly without any moral improvement. This very old
argument from the existence of suffering against the existence of an
intelligent First Cause seems to me a strong one; whereas, as just
remarked, the presence of much suffering agrees well with the view that
all organic beings have been developed through variation and natural
selection.

"At the present day the most usual argument for the existence of an
intelligent God is drawn from the deep inward conviction and feelings
which are experienced by most persons.

"Formerly I was led by feelings such as those just referred to (although
I do not think that the religious sentiment was ever strongly developed
in me), to the firm conviction of the existence of God, and of the
immortality of the soul. In my Journal I wrote that whilst standing in
the midst of the grandeur of a Brazilian forest, "it is not possible to
give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, admiration,
and devotion, which fill and elevate the mind." I well remember my
conviction that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body.
But now the grandest scenes would not cause any such convictions and
feelings to rise in my mind. It may be truly said that I am like a man
who has become colour-blind, and the universal belief by men of the
existence of redness makes my present loss of perception of not the
least value as evidence. This argument would be a valid one if all men
of all races had the same inward conviction of the existence of one
God; but we know that this is very far from being the case. Therefore I
cannot see that such inward convictions and feelings are of any weight
as evidence of what really exists. The state of mind which grand scenes
formerly excited in me, and which was intimately connected with a belief
in God, did not essentially differ from that which is often called
the sense of sublimity; and however difficult it may be to explain the
genesis of this sense, it can hardly be advanced as an argument for the
existence of God, any more than the powerful though vague and similar
feelings excited by music.

"With respect to immortality, nothing shows me [so clearly] how strong
and almost instinctive a belief it is, as the consideration of the view
now held by most physicists, namely, that the sun with all the planets
will in time grow too cold for life, unless indeed some great body
dashes into the sun, and thus gives it fresh life. Believing as I do
that man in the distant future will be a far more perfect creature than
he now is, it is an intolerable thought that he and all other sentient
beings are doomed to complete annihilation after such long-continued
slow progress. To those who fully admit the immortality of the human
soul, the destruction of our world will not appear so dreadful.

"Another source of conviction in the existence of God, connected with
the reason, and not with the feelings, impresses me as having much more
weight. This follows from the extreme difficulty or rather impossibility
of conceiving this immense and wonderful universe, including man with
his capacity of looking far backwards and far into futurity, as the
result of blind chance or necessity. When thus reflecting I feel
compelled to look to a First Cause having an intelligent mind in some
degree analogous to that of man; and I deserve to be called a Theist.
This conclusion was strong in my mind about the time, as far as I can
remember, when I wrote the 'Origin of Species;' and it is since that
time that it has very gradually, with many fluctuations, become weaker.
But then arises the doubt, can the mind of man, which has, as I fully
believe, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the
lowest animals, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions?

"I cannot pretend to throw the least light on such abstruse problems.
The mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us; and I for
one must be content to remain an Agnostic."

[The following letters repeat to some extent what has been given from
the Autobiography. The first one refers to 'The Boundaries of Science, a
Dialogue,' published in 'Macmillan's Magazine,' for July 1861.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS JULIA WEDGWOOD. July 11 [1861].

Some one has sent us 'Macmillan'; and I must tell you how much I admire
your Article; though at the same time I must confess that I could not
clearly follow you in some parts, which probably is in main part due
to my not being at all accustomed to metaphysical trains of thought. I
think that you understand my book (The 'Origin of Species.') perfectly,
and that I find a very rare event with my critics. The ideas in the
last page have several times vaguely crossed my mind. Owing to several
correspondents I have been led lately to think, or rather to try to
think over some of the chief points discussed by you. But the result has
been with me a maze--something like thinking on the origin of evil, to
which you allude. The mind refuses to look at this universe, being what
it is, without having been designed; yet, where one would most expect
design, viz. in the structure of a sentient being, the more I think
on the subject, the less I can see proof of design. Asa Gray and some
others look at each variation, or at least at each beneficial variation
(which A. Gray would compare with the rain drops (Dr. Gray's rain-drop
metaphor occurs in the Essay 'Darwin and his Reviewers' ('Darwiniana,'
page 157): "The whole animate life of a country depends absolutely upon
the vegetation, the vegetation upon the rain. The moisture is furnished
by the ocean, is raised by the sun's heat from the ocean's surface, and
is wafted inland by the winds. But what multitudes of rain-drops fall
back into the ocean--are as much without a final cause as the incipient
varieties which come to nothing! Does it therefore follow that the rains
which are bestowed upon the soil with such rule and average regularity
were not designed to support vegetable and animal life?") which do not
fall on the sea, but on to the land to fertilize it) as having been
providentially designed. Yet when I ask him whether he looks at each
variation in the rock-pigeon, by which man has made by accumulation
a pouter or fantail pigeon, as providentially designed for man's
amusement, he does not know what to answer; and if he, or any one,
admits [that] these variations are accidental, as far as purpose is
concerned (of course not accidental as to their cause or origin); then I
can see no reason why he should rank the accumulated variations by which
the beautifully adapted woodpecker has been formed, as providentially
designed. For it would be easy to imagine the enlarged crop of the
pouter, or tail of the fantail, as of some use to birds, in a state of
nature, having peculiar habits of life. These are the considerations
which perplex me about design; but whether you will care to hear them, I
know not....

[On the subject of design, he wrote (July 1860) to Dr. Gray:

"One word more on 'designed laws' and 'undesigned results.' I see a bird
which I want for food, take my gun and kill it, I do this DESIGNEDLY.
An innocent and good man stands under a tree and is killed by a flash
of lightning. Do you believe (and I really should like to hear) that
God DESIGNEDLY killed this man? Many or most persons do believe this; I
can't and don't. If you believe so, do you believe that when a swallow
snaps up a gnat that God designed that that particular swallow should
snap up that particular gnat at that particular instant? I believe
that the man and the gnat are in the same predicament. If the death of
neither man nor gnat are designed, I see no good reason to believe that
their FIRST birth or production should be necessarily designed."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO W. GRAHAM. Down, July 3rd, 1881.

Dear Sir,

I hope that you will not think it intrusive on my part to thank you
heartily for the pleasure which I have derived from reading your
admirably written 'Creed of Science,' though I have not yet quite
finished it, as now that I am old I read very slowly. It is a very long
time since any other book has interested me so much. The work must have
cost you several years and much hard labour with full leisure for work.
You would not probably expect any one fully to agree with you on so many
abstruse subjects; and there are some points in your book which I cannot
digest. The chief one is that the existence of so-called natural laws
implies purpose. I cannot see this. Not to mention that many expect that
the several great laws will some day be found to follow inevitably from
some one single law, yet taking the laws as we now know them, and
look at the moon, where the law of gravitation--and no doubt of the
conservation of energy--of the atomic theory, etc. etc., hold good, and
I cannot see that there is then necessarily any purpose. Would there
be purpose if the lowest organisms alone, destitute of consciousness
existed in the moon? But I have had no practice in abstract reasoning,
and I may be all astray. Nevertheless you have expressed my inward
conviction, though far more vividly and clearly than I could have done,
that the Universe is not the result of chance. (The Duke of Argyll
('Good Words,' Ap. 1885, page 244) has recorded a few words on this
subject, spoken by my father in the last year of his life. "...in the
course of that conversation I said to Mr. Darwin, with reference to some
of his own remarkable works on the 'Fertilization of Orchids,' and
upon 'The Earthworms,' and various other observations he made of the
wonderful contrivances for certain purposes in nature--I said it was
impossible to look at these without seeing that they were the effect
and the expression of mind. I shall never forget Mr. Darwin's answer.
He looked at me very hard and said, 'Well, that often comes over me with
overwhelming force; but at other times,' and he shook his head vaguely,
adding, 'it seems to go away.'") But then with me the horrid doubt
always arises whether the convictions of man's mind, which has been
developed from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value or at all
trustworthy. Would any one trust in the convictions of a monkey's mind,
if there are any convictions in such a mind? Secondly, I think that I
could make somewhat of a case against the enormous importance which you
attribute to our greatest men; I have been accustomed to think, second,
third, and fourth rate men of very high importance, at least in the case
of Science. Lastly, I could show fight on natural selection having done
and doing more for the progress of civilization than you seem inclined
to admit. Remember what risk the nations of Europe ran, not so many
centuries ago of being overwhelmed by the Turks, and how ridiculous such
an idea now is! The more civilised so-called Caucasian races have beaten
the Turkish hollow in the struggle for existence. Looking to the world
at no very distant date, what an endless number of the lower races will
have been eliminated by the higher civilized races throughout the world.
But I will write no more, and not even mention the many points in your
work which have much interested me. I have indeed cause to apologise for
troubling you with my impressions, and my sole excuse is the excitement
in my mind which your book has aroused.

I beg leave to remain, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully and obliged, CHARLES
DARWIN.


[My father spoke little on these subjects, and I can contribute nothing
from my own recollection of his conversation which can add to the
impression here given of his attitude towards Religion. Some further
idea of his views may, however, be gathered from occasional remarks in
his letters.] (Dr. Aveling has published an account of a conversation
with my father. I think that the readers of this pamphlet ('The
Religious Views of Charles Darwin,' Free Thought Publishing Company,
1883) may be misled into seeing more resemblance than really existed
between the positions of my father and Dr. Aveling: and I say this
in spite of my conviction that Dr. Aveling gives quite fairly his
impressions of my father's views. Dr. Aveling tried to show that the
terms "Agnostic" and "Atheist" were practically equivalent--that an
atheist is one who, without denying the existence of God, is without
God, inasmuch as he is unconvinced of the existence of a Deity. My
father's replies implied his preference for the unaggressive attitude
of an Agnostic. Dr. Aveling seems (page 5) to regard the absence
of aggressiveness in my father's views as distinguishing them in an
unessential manner from his own. But, in my judgment, it is precisely
differences of this kind which distinguish him so completely from the
class of thinkers to which Dr. Aveling belongs.)




CHAPTER 1.IX. -- LIFE AT DOWN.

1842-1854.

"My life goes on like clockwork, and I am fixed on the spot where I
shall end it."

Letter to Captain Fitz-Roy, October, 1846.

[With the view of giving in the following chapters a connected account
of the growth of the 'Origin of Species,' I have taken the more
important letters bearing on that subject out of their proper
chronological position here, and placed them with the rest of the
correspondence bearing on the same subject; so that in the present group
of letters we only get occasional hints of the growth of my father's
views, and we may suppose ourselves to be looking at his life, as it
might have been looked at by those who had no knowledge of the quiet
development of his theory of evolution during this period.]

On September 14, 1842, my father left London with his family and settled
at Down. (I must not omit to mention a member of the household who
accompanied him. This was his butler, Joseph Parslow, who remained in
the family, a valued friend and servant, for forty years, and became as
Sir Joseph Hooker once remarked to me, "an integral part of the
family, and felt to be such by all visitors at the house.") In the
Autobiographical chapter, his motives for taking this step in the
country are briefly given. He speaks of the attendance at scientific
societies, and ordinary social duties, as suiting his health so "badly
that we resolved to live in the country, which we both preferred and
have never repented of." His intention of keeping up with scientific
life in London is expressed in a letter to Fox (December, 1842):--

"I hope by going up to town for a night every fortnight or three weeks,
to keep up my communication with scientific men and my own zeal, and so
not to turn into a complete Kentish hog."

Visits to London of this kind were kept up for some years at the cost of
much exertion on his part. I have often heard him speak of the wearisome
drives of ten miles to or from Croydon or Sydenham--the nearest
stations--with an old gardener acting as coachman, who drove with great
caution and slowness up and down the many hills. In later years, all
regular scientific intercourse with London became, as before mentioned,
an impossibility.

The choice of Down was rather the result of despair than of actual
preference; my father and mother were weary of house-hunting, and the
attractive points about the place thus seemed to them to counterbalance
its somewhat more obvious faults. It had at least one desideratum,
namely quietness. Indeed it would have been difficult to find a more
retired place so near to London. In 1842 a coach drive of some twenty
miles was the only means of access to Down; and even now that railways
have crept closer to it, it is singularly out of the world, with nothing
to suggest the neighbourhood of London, unless it be the dull haze of
smoke that sometimes clouds the sky. The village stands in an angle
between two of the larger high-roads of the country, one leading to
Tunbridge and the other to Westerham and Edenbridge. It is cut off from
the Weald by a line of steep chalk hills on the south, and an abrupt
hill, now smoothed down by a cutting and embankment, must formerly
have been something of a barrier against encroachments from the side
of London. In such a situation, a village, communicating with the main
lines of traffic, only by stony tortuous lanes, may well have been
enabled to preserve its retired character. Nor is it hard to believe in
the smugglers and their strings of pack-horses making their way up from
the lawless old villages of the Weald, of which the memory still existed
when my father settled in Down. The village stands on solitary upland
country, 500 to 600 feet above the sea,-- a country with little natural
beauty, but possessing a certain charm in the shaws, or straggling
strips of wood, capping the chalky banks and looking down upon the quiet
ploughed lands of the valleys. The village, of three or four hundred
inhabitants, consists of three small streets of cottages meeting in
front of the little flint-built church. It is a place where new-comers
are seldom seen, and the names occurring far back in the old church
registers are still well-known in the village. The smock-frock is not
yet quite extinct, though chiefly used as a ceremonial dress by the
"bearers" at funerals: but as a boy I remember the purple or green
smocks of the men at church.

The house stands a quarter of a mile from the village, and is built,
like so many houses of the last century, as near as possible to the
road--a narrow lane winding away to the Westerham high-road. In 1842,
it was dull and unattractive enough: a square brick building of three
storeys, covered with shabby whitewash and hanging tiles. The garden
had none of the shrubberies or walls that now give shelter; it was
overlooked from the lane, and was open, bleak, and desolate. One of my
father's first undertakings was to lower the lane by about two feet, and
to build a flint wall along that part of it which bordered the garden.
The earth thus excavated was used in making banks and mounds round the
lawn: these were planted with evergreens, which now give to the garden
its retired and sheltered character.

The house was made to look neater by being covered with stucco, but the
chief improvement effected was the building of a large bow extending
up through three storeys. This bow became covered with a tangle of
creepers, and pleasantly varied the south side of the house. The
drawing-room, with its verandah opening into the garden, as well as the
study in which my father worked during the later years of his life, were
added at subsequent dates.

Eighteen acres of land were sold with the house, of which twelve acres
on the south side of the house formed a pleasant field, scattered with
fair-sized oaks and ashes. From this field a strip was cut off and
converted into a kitchen garden, in which the experimental plot of
ground was situated, and where the greenhouses were ultimately put up.

The following letter to Mr. Fox (March 28th, 1843) gives among other
things my father's early impressions of Down:--

"I will tell you all the trifling particulars about myself that I can
think of. We are now exceedingly busy with the first brick laid down
yesterday to an addition to our house; with this, with almost making a
new kitchen garden and sundry other projected schemes, my days are
very full. I find all this very bad for geology, but I am very slowly
progressing with a volume, or rather pamphlet, on the volcanic islands
which we visited: I manage only a couple of hours per day and that not
very regularly. It is uphill work writing books, which cost money in
publishing, and which are not read even by geologists. I forget whether
I ever described this place: it is a good, very ugly house with 18
acres, situated on a chalk flat, 560 feet above sea. There are peeps
of far distant country and the scenery is moderately pretty: its chief
merit is its extreme rurality. I think I was never in a more perfectly
quiet country. Three miles south of us the great chalk escarpment
quite cuts us off from the low country of Kent, and between us and the
escarpment there is not a village or gentleman's house, but only great
woods and arable fields (the latter in sadly preponderant numbers) so
that we are absolutely at the extreme verge of the world. The whole
country is intersected by foot-paths; but the surface over the chalk
is clayey and sticky, which is the worst feature in our purchase. The
dingles and banks often remind me of Cambridgeshire and walks with you
to Cherry Hinton, and other places, though the general aspect of the
country is very different. I was looking over my arranged cabinet
(the only remnant I have preserved of all my English insects), and was
admiring Panagaeus Crux-major: it is curious the vivid manner in
which this insect calls up in my mind your appearance, with little Fan
trotting after, when I was first introduced to you. Those entomological
days were very pleasant ones. I am VERY much stronger corporeally,
but am little better in being able to stand mental fatigue, or rather
excitement, so that I cannot dine out or receive visitors, except
relations with whom I can pass some time after dinner in silence."

I could have wished to give here some idea of the position which, at
this period of his life, my father occupied among scientific men and
the reading public generally. But contemporary notices are few and of
no particular value for my purpose,--which therefore must, in spite of a
good deal of pains, remain unfulfilled.

His 'Journal of Researches' was then the only one of his books which had
any chance of being commonly known. But the fact that it was published
with the 'Voyages' of Captains King and Fitz-Roy probably interfered
with its general popularity. Thus Lyell wrote to him in 1838 ('Lyell's
Life,' ii. page 43), "I assure you my father is quite enthusiastic about
your journal...and he agrees with me that it would have a large sale if
published separately. He was disappointed at hearing that it was to be
fettered by the other volumes, for, although he should equally buy it,
he feared so many of the public would be checked from doing so." In
a notice of the three voyages in the 'Edinburgh Review' (July, 1839),
there is nothing leading a reader to believe that he would find it more
attractive than its fellow-volumes. And, as a fact, it did not become
widely known until it was separately published in 1845. It may be
noted, however, that the 'Quarterly Review' (December, 1839) called the
attention of its readers to the merits of the 'Journal' as a book of
travels. The reviewer speaks of the "charm arising from the freshness of
heart which is thrown over these virgin pages of a strong intellectual
man and an acute and deep observer."

The German translation (1844) of the 'Journal' received a favourable
notice in No. 12 of the 'Heidelberger Jahrbucher der Literatur,'
1847--where the Reviewer speaks of the author's "varied canvas, on
which he sketches in lively colours the strange customs of those
distant regions with their remarkable fauna, flora and geological
peculiarities." Alluding to the translation, my father writes--"Dr.
Dieffenbach...has translated my 'Journal' into German, and I must, with
unpardonable vanity, boast that it was at the instigation of Liebig and
Humboldt."

The geological work of which he speaks in the above letter to Mr. Fox
occupied him for the whole of 1843, and was published in the spring
of the following year. It was entitled 'Geological Observations on the
Volcanic Islands, visited during the voyage of H.M.S. "Beagle", together
with some brief notices on the geology of Australia and the Cape of Good
Hope': it formed the second part of the 'Geology of the Voyage of the
"Beagle",' published "with the Approval of the Lords Commissioners of
Her Majesty's Treasury." The volume on 'Coral Reefs' forms Part I. of
the series, and was published, as we have seen, in 1842. For the sake
of the non-geological reader, I may here quote Professor Geikie's words
(Charles Darwin, 'Nature' Series, 1882.) on these two volumes--which
were up to this time my father's chief geological works. Speaking of the
'Coral Reefs,' he says:--page 17, "This well-known treatise, the most
original of all its author's geological memoirs, has become one of the
classics of geological literature. The origin of those remarkable rings
of coral-rock in mid-ocean has given rise to much speculation, but no
satisfactory solution of the problem has been proposed. After visiting
many of them, and examining also coral reefs that fringe islands and
continents, he offered a theory which for simplicity and grandeur
strikes every reader with astonishment. It is pleasant, after the lapse
of many years, to recall the delight with which one first read the
'Coral Reefs'; how one watched the facts being marshalled into their
places, nothing being ignored or passed lightly over; and how, step by
step, one was led to the grand conclusion of wide oceanic subsidence. No
more admirable example of scientific method was ever given to the world,
and even if he had written nothing else, the treatise alone would have
placed Darwin in the very front of investigators of nature."

It is interesting to see in the following extract from one of Lyell's
letters (To Sir John Herschel, May 24, 1837. 'Life of Sir Charles
Lyell,' vol. ii. page 12.) how warmly and readily he embraced the
theory. The extract also gives incidentally some idea of the theory
itself.

"I am very full of Darwin's new theory of Coral Islands, and have urged
Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give up my
volcanic crater theory for ever, though it cost me a pang at first,
for it accounted for so much, the annular form, the central lagoon, the
sudden rising of an isolated mountain in a deep sea; all went so well
with the notion of submerged, crateriform, and conical volcanoes,... and
then the fact that in the South Pacific we had scarcely any rocks in the
regions of coral islands, save two kinds, coral limestone and volcanic!
Yet spite of all this, the whole theory is knocked on the head, and the
annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes, nor
even with a crateriform bottom. Perhaps Darwin told you when at the
Cape what he considers the true cause? Let any mountain be submerged
gradually, and coral grow in the sea in which it is sinking, and there
will be a ring of coral, and finally only a lagoon in the centre. Why?
For the same reason that a barrier reef of coral grows along certain
coasts: Australia, etc. Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning
continents to lift their heads above water. Regions of elevation and
subsidence in the ocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs."
There is little to be said as to published contemporary criticism.
The book was not reviewed in the 'Quarterly Review' till 1847, when
a favourable notice was given. The reviewer speaks of the "bold and
startling" character of the work, but seems to recognize the fact that
the views are generally accepted by geologists. By that time the minds
of men were becoming more ready to receive geology of this type. Even
ten years before, in 1837, Lyell ('Life of Sir Charles Lyell,' vol. ii.
page 6.) says, "people are now much better prepared to believe Darwin
when he advances proofs of the slow rise of the Andes, than they were
in 1830, when I first startled them with that doctrine." This sentence
refers to the theory elaborated in my father's geological observations
on South America (1846), but the gradual change in receptivity of the
geological mind must have been favourable to all his geological work.
Nevertheless, Lyell seems at first not to have expected any ready
acceptance of the Coral theory; thus he wrote to my father in 1837:--"I
could think of nothing for days after your lesson on coral reefs, but
of the tops of submerged continents. It is all true, but do not flatter
yourself that you will be believed till you are growing bald like me,
with hard work and vexation at the incredulity of the world."

The second part of the 'Geology of the Voyage of the "Beagle",' i.e. the
volume on Volcanic Islands, which specially concerns us now, cannot
be better described than by again quoting from Professor Geikie (page
18):--

"Full of detailed observations, this work still remains the best
authority on the general geological structure of most of the regions it
describes. At the time it was written the 'crater of elevation theory,'
though opposed by Constant Prevost, Scrope, and Lyell, was generally
accepted, at least on the Continent. Darwin, however, could not receive
it as a valid explanation of the facts; and though he did not share the
view of its chief opponents, but ventured to propose a hypothesis of
his own, the observations impartially made and described by him in this
volume must be regarded as having contributed towards the final solution
of the difficulty." Professor Geikie continues (page 21): "He is one
of the earliest writers to recognize the magnitude of the denudation to
which even recent geological accumulations have been subjected. One of
the most impressive lessons to be learnt from his account of 'Volcanic
Islands' is the prodigious extent to which they have been denuded...He
was disposed to attribute more of this work to the sea than most
geologists would now admit; but he lived himself to modify his original
views, and on this subject his latest utterances are quite abreast of
the time."

An extract from a letter of my father's to Lyell shows his estimate
of his own work. "You have pleased me much by saying that you intend
looking through my 'Volcanic Islands': it cost me eighteen months!!! and
I have heard of very few who have read it. Now I shall feel, whatever
little (and little it is) there is confirmatory of old work, or new,
will work its effect and not be lost."

The third of his geological books, 'Geological Observations on South
America,' may be mentioned here, although it was not published until
1846. "In this work the author embodied all the materials collected by
him for the illustration of South American Geology, save some which have
been published elsewhere. One of the most important features of the book
was the evidence which it brought forward to prove the slow interrupted
elevation of the South American Continent during a recent geological
period." (Geikie, loc. cit.)

Of this book my father wrote to Lyell:--"My volume will be about 240
pages, dreadfully dull, yet much condensed. I think whenever you have
time to look through it, you will think the collection of facts on the
elevation of the land and on the formation of terraces pretty good."

Of his special geological work as a whole, Professor Geikie, while
pointing out that it was not "of the same epoch-making kind as his
biological researches," remarks that he "gave a powerful impulse to" the
general reception of Lyell's teaching "by the way in which he gathered
from all parts of the world facts in its support."


WORK OF THE PERIOD 1842 TO 1854.

The work of these years may be roughly divided into a period of geology
from 1842 to 1846, and one of zoology from 1846 onwards.

I extract from his diary notices of the time spent on his geological
books and on his 'Journal.'

'Volcanic Islands.' Summer of 1842 to January, 1844.

'Geology of South America.' July, 1844, to April, 1845.

Second Edition of 'The Journal,' October, 1845, to October, 1846.

The time between October, 1846, and October, 1854, was practically given
up to working at the Cirripedia (Barnacles); the results were published
in two volumes by the Ray Society in 1851 and 1854. His volumes on the
Fossil Cirripedes were published by the Palaeontographical Society in
1851 and 1854.

Some account of these volumes will be given later.

The minor works may be placed together, independently of subject matter.

"Observations on the Structure, etc., of the genus Sagitta," Ann. Nat.
Hist. xiii., 1844, pages 1-6.

"Brief descriptions of several Terrestrial Planariae, etc.," Ann. Nat.
Hist. xiv., 1844, pages 241-251.

"An Account of the Fine Dust (A sentence occurs in this paper of
interest, as showing that the author was alive to the importance of all
means of distribution:--

"The fact that particles of this size have been brought at least 330
miles from the land is interesting as bearing on the distribution of
Cryptogamic plants.") which often Falls on Vessels in the Atlantic
Ocean," Geol. Soc. Journ. ii., 1846, pages 26-30.

"On the Geology of the Falkland Islands," Geol. Soc. Journ. ii., 1846,
pages 267-274.

"On the Transportal of Erratic Boulders, etc.," Geol. Soc. Journ. iv.,
1848, pages 315-323. (An extract from a letter to Lyell, 1847, is of
interest in connection with this essay:--"Would you be so good (if you
know it) as to put Maclaren's address on the enclosed letter and post
it. It is chiefly to enquire in what paper he has described the Boulders
on Arthur's Seat. Mr. D. Milne in the last Edinburgh 'New Phil. Journal'
[1847], has a long paper on it. He says: 'Some glacialists have ventured
to explain the transportation of boulders even in the situation of those
now referred to, by imagining that they were transported on ice floes,'
etc. He treats this view, and the scratching of rocks by icebergs, as
almost absurd...he has finally stirred me up so, that (without you
would answer him) I think I will send a paper in opposition to the same
Journal. I can thus introduce some old remarks of mine, and some new,
and will insist on your capital observations in N. America. It is a bore
to stop one's work, but he has made me quite wroth.")

The article "Geology," in the Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry
(1849), pages 156-195. This was written in the spring of 1848.

"On British Fossil Lepadidae," 'Geol. Soc. Journ.' vi., 1850, pages
439-440.

"Analogy of the structure of some Volcanic Rocks with that of Glaciers,"
'Edin. Roy. Soc. Proc.' ii., 1851, pages 17-18.

Professor Geikie has been so good as to give me (in a letter dated
November 1885) his impressions of my father's article in the 'Admiralty
Manual.' He mentions the following points as characteristic of the
work:--

"1. Great breadth of view. No one who had not practically studied and
profoundly reflected on the questions discussed could have written it.

"2. The insight so remarkable in all that Mr. Darwin ever did. The way
in which he points out lines of enquiry that would elucidate geological
problems is eminently typical of him. Some of these lines have never yet
been adequately followed; so with regard to them he was in advance of
his time.

"3. Interesting and sympathetic treatment. The author at once puts his
readers into harmony with him. He gives them enough of information to
show how delightful the field is to which he invites them, and how much
they might accomplish in it. There is a broad sketch of the subject
which everybody can follow, and there is enough of detail to instruct
and guide a beginner and start him on the right track.

"Of course, geology has made great strides since 1849, and the article,
if written now, would need to take notice of other branches of inquiry,
and to modify statements which are not now quite accurate; but most of
the advice Mr. Darwin gives is as needful and valuable now as when it
was given. It is curious to see with what unerring instinct he seems to
have fastened on the principles that would stand the test of time."

In a letter to Lyell (1853) my father wrote, "I went up for a paper by
the Arctic Dr. Sutherland, on ice action, read only in abstract, but I
should think with much good matter. It was very pleasant to hear that it
was written owing to the Admiralty Manual."

To give some idea of the retired life which now began for my father at
Down, I have noted from his diary the short periods during which he was
away from home between the autumn of 1842, when he came to Down, and the
end of 1854.

  1843 July.--Week at Maer and Shrewsbury.
         October.--Twelve days at Shrewsbury.

  1844 April.--Week at Maer and Shrewsbury.
         July.--Twelve days at Shrewsbury.

  1845 September 15.--Six weeks, "Shrewsbury, Lincolnshire, York,
         the Dean of Manchester, Waterton, Chatsworth."

  1846 February.--Eleven days at Shrewsbury.
         July.--Ten days at Shrewsbury.
         September.--Ten days at Southampton, etc., for the British
         Association.

  1847 February.--Twelve days at Shrewsbury.
         June.--Ten days at Oxford, etc., for the British Association.
         October.--Fortnight at Shrewsbury.

  1848 May.--Fortnight at Shrewsbury.
         July.--Week at Swanage.
         October.--Fortnight at Shrewsbury.
         November.--Eleven days at Shrewsbury.

  1849 March to June.--Sixteen weeks at Malvern.
         September.--Eleven days at Birmingham for the
         British Association.

  1850 June.--Week at Malvern.
        August.--Week at Leith Hill, the house of a relative.
        October.--Week at the house of another relative.

 1851 March.--Week at Malvern.
        April.--Nine days at Malvern.
        July.--Twelve days in London.

 1852 March.--Week at Rugby and Shrewsbury.
        September.--Six days at the house of a relative.

 1853 July.--Three weeks at Eastbourne.
        August.--Five days at the military Camp at Chobham.

 1854 March.--Five days at the house of a relative.
        July.--Three days at the house of a relative.
        October.--Six days at the house of a relative.

It will be seen that he was absent from home sixty weeks in twelve
years. But it must be remembered that much of the remaining time spent
at Down was lost through ill-health.]


LETTERS.


CHARLES DARWIN TO R. FITZ-ROY. Down [March 31st, 1843].

Dear Fitz-Roy,

I read yesterday with surprise and the greatest interest, your
appointment as Governor of New Zealand. I do not know whether to
congratulate you on it, but I am sure I may the Colony, on possessing
your zeal and energy. I am most anxious to know whether the report is
true, for I cannot bear the thoughts of your leaving the country without
seeing you once again; the past is often in my memory, and I feel that
I owe to you much bygone enjoyment, and the whole destiny of my
life, which (had my health been stronger) would have been one full of
satisfaction to me. During the last three months I have never once
gone up to London without intending to call in the hopes of seeing Mrs.
Fitz-Roy and yourself; but I find, most unfortunately for myself,
that the little excitement of breaking out of my most quiet routine so
generally knocks me up, that I am able to do scarcely anything when in
London, and I have not even been able to attend one evening meeting of
the Geological Society. Otherwise, I am very well, as are, thank God, my
wife and two children. The extreme retirement of this place suits us all
very well, and we enjoy our country life much. But I am writing trifles
about myself, when your mind and time must be fully occupied. My object
in writing is to beg of you or Mrs. Fitz-Roy to have the kindness to
send me one line to say whether it is true, and whether you sail soon.
I shall come up next week for one or two days; could you see me for even
five minutes, if I called early on Thursday morning, viz. at nine or ten
o'clock, or at whatever hour (if you keep early ship hours) you finish
your breakfast. Pray remember me very kindly to Mrs. Fitz-Roy, who I
trust is able to look at her long voyage with boldness.

Believe me, dear Fitz-Roy, Your ever truly obliged, CHARLES DARWIN.


[A quotation from another letter (1846) to Fitz-Roy may be worth giving,
as showing my father's affectionate remembrance of his old Captain.

"Farewell, dear Fitz-Roy, I often think of your many acts of kindness
to me, and not seldomest on the time, no doubt quite forgotten by you,
when, before making Madeira, you came and arranged my hammock with
your own hands, and which, as I afterwards heard, brought tears into my
father's eyes."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. [Down, September 5, 1843.] Monday morning.

My dear Fox,

When I sent off the glacier paper, I was just going out and so had no
time to write. I hope your friend will enjoy (and I wish you were going
there with him) his tour as much as I did. It was a kind of geological
novel. But your friend must have patience, for he will not get a good
GLACIAL EYE for a few days. Murchison and Count Keyserling RUSHED
through North Wales the same autumn and could see nothing except the
effects of rain trickling over the rocks! I cross-examined Murchison
a little, and evidently saw he had looked carefully at nothing. I feel
CERTAIN about the glacier-effects in North Wales. Get up your steam,
if this weather lasts, and have a ramble in Wales; its glorious scenery
must do every one's heart and body good. I wish I had energy to come to
Delamere and go with you; but as you observe, you might as well ask
St. Paul's. Whenever I give myself a trip, it shall be, I think, to
Scotland, to hunt for more parallel roads. My marine theory for these
roads was for a time knocked on the head by Agassiz ice-work, but it is
now reviving again...

Farewell,--we are getting nearly finished--almost all the workmen gone,
and the gravel laying down on the walks. Ave Maria! how the money does
go. There are twice as many temptations to extravagance in the country
compared with London. Adios.

Yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1844?].

...I have also read the 'Vestiges,' ('The Vestiges of the Natural
History of Creation' was published anonymously in 1844, and is
confidently believed to have been written by the late Robert Chambers.
My father's copy gives signs of having been carefully read, a long list
of marked passages being pinned in at the end. One useful lesson he
seems to have learned from it. He writes: "The idea of a fish passing
into a reptile, monstrous. I will not specify any genealogies--much too
little known at present." He refers again to the book in a letter to
Fox, February, 1845: "Have you read that strange, unphilosophical but
capitally-written book, the 'Vestiges': it has made more talk than any
work of late, and has been by some attributed to me--at which I ought to
be much flattered and unflattered."), but have been somewhat less amused
at it than you appear to have been: the writing and arrangement are
certainly admirable, but his geology strikes me as bad, and his zoology
far worse. I should be very much obliged, if at any future or leisure
time you could tell me on what you ground your doubtful belief in
imagination of a mother affecting her offspring. (This refers to the
case of a relative of Sir J. Hooker's, who insisted that a mole, which
appeared on one of her children, was the effect of fright upon herself
on having, before the birth of the child, blotted with sepia a copy
of Turner's 'Liber Studiorum' that had been lent to her with special
injunctions to be careful.) I have attended to the several statements
scattered about, but do not believe in more than accidental
coincidences. W. Hunter told my father, then in a lying-in hospital,
that in many thousand cases, he had asked the mother, BEFORE HER
CONFINEMENT, whether anything had affected her imagination, and recorded
the answers; and absolutely not one case came right, though, when the
child was anything remarkable, they afterwards made the cap to fit.
Reproduction seems governed by such similar laws in the whole animal
kingdom, that I am most loth [to believe]...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.M. HERBERT. Down [1844 or 1845].

My dear Herbert,

I was very glad to see your handwriting and hear a bit of news about
you. Though you cannot come here this autumn, I do hope you and Mrs.
Herbert will come in the winter, and we will have lots of talk of old
times, and lots of Beethoven.

I have little or rather nothing to say about myself; we live like
clock-work, and in what most people would consider the dullest
possible manner. I have of late been slaving extra hard, to the great
discomfiture of wretched digestive organs, at South America, and thank
all the fates, I have done three-fourths of it. Writing plain English
grows with me more and more difficult, and never attainable. As for your
pretending that you will read anything so dull as my pure geological
descriptions, lay not such a flattering unction on my soul (On the same
subject he wrote to Fitz-Roy: "I have sent my 'South American Geology'
to Dover Street, and you will get it, no doubt, in the course of time.
You do not know what you threaten when you propose to read it--it is
purely geological. I said to my brother, 'You will of course read it,'
and his answer was, 'Upon my life, I would sooner even buy it.'") for
it is incredible. I have long discovered that geologists never read each
other's works, and that the only object in writing a book is a proof of
earnestness, and that you do not form your opinions without undergoing
labour of some kind. Geology is at present very oral, and what I here
say is to a great extent quite true. But I am giving you a discussion as
long as a chapter in the odious book itself.

I have lately been to Shrewsbury, and found my father surprisingly well
and cheerful.

Believe me, my dear old friend, ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Monday [February 10th, 1845].

My dear Hooker,

I am much obliged for your very agreeable letter; it was very
good-natured, in the midst of your scientific and theatrical
dissipation, to think of writing so long a letter to me. I am astonished
at your news, and I must condole with you in your PRESENT view of the
Professorship (Sir J.D. Hooker was a candidate for the Professorship of
Botany at Edinburgh University.), and most heartily deplore it on my
own account. There is something so chilling in a separation of so many
hundred miles, though we did not see much of each other when nearer.
You will hardly believe how deeply I regret for MYSELF your present
prospects. I had looked forward to [our] seeing much of each other
during our lives. It is a heavy disappointment; and in a mere selfish
point of view, as aiding me in my work, your loss is indeed irreparable.
But, on the other hand, I cannot doubt that you take at present a
desponding, instead of bright, view of your prospects: surely there
are great advantages, as well as disadvantages. The place is one of
eminence; and really it appears to me there are so many indifferent
workers, and so few readers, that it is a high advantage, in a purely
scientific point of view, for a good worker to hold a position which
leads others to attend to his work. I forget whether you attended
Edinburgh, as a student, but in my time there was a knot of men who were
far from being the indifferent and dull listeners which you expect for
your audience. Reflect what a satisfaction and honour it would be to
MAKE a good botanist--with your disposition you will be to many what
Henslow was at Cambridge to me and others, a most kind friend and guide.
Then what a fine garden, and how good a Public Library! why, Forbes
always regrets the advantages of Edinburgh for work: think of the
inestimable advantage of getting within a short walk of those noble
rocks and hills and sandy shores near Edinburgh! Indeed, I cannot
pity you much, though I pity myself exceedingly in your loss. Surely
lecturing will, in a year or two, with your GREAT capacity for work
(whatever you may be pleased to say to the contrary) become easy, and
you will have a fair time for your Antarctic Flora and general views of
distribution. If I thought your Professorship would stop your work, I
should wish it and all the good worldly consequences at el Diavolo. I
know I shall live to see you the first authority in Europe on that grand
subject, that almost keystone of the laws of creation, Geographical
Distribution. Well, there is one comfort, you will be at Kew, no doubt,
every year, so I shall finish by forcing down your throat my sincere
congratulations. Thanks for all your news. I grieve to hear Humboldt is
failing; one cannot help feeling, though unrightly, that such an end is
humiliating: even when I saw him he talked beyond all reason. If you see
him again, pray give him my most respectful and kind compliments, and
say that I never forget that my whole course of life is due to having
read and re-read as a youth his 'Personal Narrative.' How true
and pleasing are all your remarks on his kindness; think how many
opportunities you will have, in your new place, of being a Humboldt
to others. Ask him about the river in N.E. Europe, with the Flora very
different on its opposite banks. I have got and read your Wilkes; what a
feeble book in matter and style, and how splendidly got up! Do write me
a line from Berlin. Also thanks for the proof-sheets. I do not,
however, mean proof plates; I value them, as saving me copying extracts.
Farewell, my dear Hooker, with a heavy heart I wish you joy of your
prospects.

Your sincere friend,

C. DARWIN.


[The second edition of the 'Journal,' to which the following letter
refers, was completed between April 25th and August 25th. It was
published by Mr. Murray in the 'Colonial and Home Library,' and in this
more accessible form soon had a large sale.

Up to the time of his first negotiations with Mr. Murray for its
publication in this form, he had received payment only in the form of a
large number of presentation copies, and he seems to have been glad to
sell the copyright of the second edition to Mr. Murray for 150 pounds.

The points of difference between it and the first edition are of
interest chiefly in connection with the growth of the author's views on
evolution, and will be considered later.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down [July, 1845].

My dear Lyell,

I send you the first part (No doubt proof-sheets.) of the new edition
[of the 'Journal of Researches'], which I so entirely owe to you. You
will see that I have ventured to dedicate it to you (The dedication of
the second edition of the 'Journal of Researches,' is as follows:--"To
Charles Lyell, Esq., F.R.S., this second edition is dedicated with
grateful pleasure--as an acknowledgment that the chief part of whatever
scientific merit this Journal and the other works of the Author may
possess, has been derived from studying the well-known and admirable
'Principles of Geology.'"), and I trust that this cannot be
disagreeable. I have long wished, not so much for your sake, as for
my own feelings of honesty, to acknowledge more plainly than by mere
reference, how much I geologically owe you. Those authors, however, who
like you, educate people's minds as well as teach them special facts,
can never, I should think, have full justice done them except by
posterity, for the mind thus insensibly improved can hardly perceive its
own upward ascent. I had intended putting in the present acknowledgment
in the third part of my Geology, but its sale is so exceedingly small
that I should not have had the satisfaction of thinking that as far as
lay in my power I had owned, though imperfectly, my debt. Pray do not
think that I am so silly, as to suppose that my dedication can any ways
gratify you, except so far as I trust you will receive it, as a most
sincere mark of my gratitude and friendship. I think I have improved
this edition, especially the second part, which I have just finished.
I have added a good deal about the Fuegians, and cut down into half
the mercilessly long discussion on climate and glaciers, etc. I do not
recollect anything added to the first part, long enough to call your
attention to; there is a page of description of a very curious breed of
oxen in Banda Oriental. I should like you to read the few last pages;
there is a little discussion on extinction, which will not perhaps
strike you as new, though it has so struck me, and has placed in my mind
all the difficulties with respect to the causes of extinction, in the
same class with other difficulties which are generally quite overlooked
and undervalued by naturalists; I ought, however, to have made my
discussion longer and shewn by facts, as I easily could, how steadily
every species must be checked in its numbers.

I received your Travels ('Travels in North America,' 2 volumes, 1845.)
yesterday; and I like exceedingly its external and internal appearance;
I read only about a dozen pages last night (for I was tired with
hay-making), but I saw quite enough to perceive how VERY much it will
interest me, and how many passages will be scored. I am pleased to find
a good sprinkling of Natural History; I shall be astonished if it does
not sell very largely...

How sorry I am to think that we shall not see you here again for so
long; I wish you may knock yourself a little bit up before you start and
require a day's fresh air, before the ocean breezes blow on you...

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, Saturday [August 1st, 1845].

My dear Lyell,

I have been wishing to write to you for a week past, but every five
minutes' worth of strength has been expended in getting out my second
part. (Of the second edition of the 'Journal of Researches.') Your note
pleased me a good deal more I dare say than my dedication did you, and I
thank you much for it. Your work has interested me much, and I will give
you my impressions, though, as I never thought you would care to hear
what I thought of the non-scientific parts, I made no notes, nor took
pains to remember any particular impression of two-thirds of the first
volume. The first impression I should say would be with most (though I
have literally seen not one soul since reading it) regret at there not
being more of the non-scientific [parts]. I am not a good judge, for
I have read nothing, i.e. non-scientific about North America, but the
whole struck me as very new, fresh, and interesting. Your discussions
bore to my mind the evident stamp of matured thought, and of conclusions
drawn from facts observed by yourself, and not from the opinions of the
people whom you met; and this I suspect is comparatively rare.

Your slave discussion disturbed me much; but as you would care no more
for my opinion on this head than for the ashes of this letter, I will
say nothing except that it gave me some sleepless, most uncomfortable
hours. Your account of the religious state of the States particularly
interested me; I am surprised throughout at your very proper boldness
against the Clergy. In your University chapter the Clergy, and not the
State of Education, are most severely and justly handled, and this I
think is very bold, for I conceive you might crush a leaden-headed old
Don, as a Don, with more safety, than touch the finger of that Corporate
Animal, the Clergy. What a contrast in Education does England show
itself! Your apology (using the term, like the old religionists who
meant anything but an apology) for lectures, struck me as very clever;
but all the arguments in the world on your side, are not equal to one
course of Jamieson's Lectures on the other side, which I formerly for
my sins experienced. Although I had read about the 'Coalfields in North
America,' I never in the smallest degree really comprehended their area,
their thickness and favourable position; nothing hardly astounded me
more in your book.

Some few parts struck me as rather heterogeneous, but I do not know
whether to an extent that at all signified. I missed however, a good
deal, some general heading to the chapters, such as the two or three
principal places visited. One has no right to expect an author to write
down to the zero of geographical ignorance of the reader; but I not
knowing a single place, was occasionally rather plagued in tracing your
course. Sometimes in the beginning of a chapter, in one paragraph your
course was traced through a half dozen places; anyone, as ignorant as
myself, if he could be found, would prefer such a disturbing paragraph
left out. I cut your map loose, and I found that a great comfort; I
could not follow your engraved track. I think in a second edition,
interspaces here and there of one line open, would be an improvement. By
the way, I take credit to myself in giving my Journal a less scientific
air in having printed all names of species and genera in Romans;
the printing looks, also, better. All the illustrations strike me
as capital, and the map is an admirable volume in itself. If your
'Principles' had not met with such universal admiration, I should have
feared there would have been too much geology in this for the general
reader; certainly all that the most clear and light style could do,
has been done. To myself the geology was an excellent, well-condensed,
well-digested resume of all that has been made out in North America,
and every geologist ought to be grateful to you. The summing up of the
Niagara chapter appeared to me the grandest part; I was also deeply
interested by your discussion on the origin of the Silurian formations.
I have made scores of SCORES marking passages hereafter useful to me.

All the coal theory appeared to me very good; but it is no use going on
enumerating in this manner. I wish there had been more Natural History;
I liked ALL the scattered fragments. I have now given you an exact
transcript of my thoughts, but they are hardly worth your reading...


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, August 25th [1845].

My dear Lyell,

This is literally the first day on which I have had any time to spare;
and I will amuse myself by beginning a letter to you...

I was delighted with your letter in which you touch on Slavery; I wish
the same feelings had been apparent in your published discussion. But
I will not write on this subject, I should perhaps annoy you, and most
certainly myself. I have exhaled myself with a paragraph or two in my
Journal on the sin of Brazilian slavery; you perhaps will think that
it is in answer to you; but such is not the case. I have remarked on
nothing which I did not hear on the coast of South America. My few
sentences, however, are merely an explosion of feeling. How could you
relate so placidly that atrocious sentiment (In the passage referred
to, Lyell does not give his own views, but those of a planter.) about
separating children from their parents; and in the next page speak of
being distressed at the whites not having prospered; I assure you the
contrast made me exclaim out. But I have broken my intention, and so no
more on this odious deadly subject.

There is a favourable, but not strong enough review on you, in the
"Gardeners' Chronicle". I am sorry to see that Lindley abides by the
carbonic acid gas theory. By the way, I was much pleased by Lindley
picking out my extinction paragraphs and giving them uncurtailed. To
my mind, putting the comparative rarity of existing species in the same
category with extinction has removed a great weight; though of course
it does not explain anything, it shows that until we can explain
comparative rarity, we ought not to feel any surprise at not explaining
extinction...

I am much pleased to hear of the call for a new edition of the
'Principles': what glorious good that work has done. I fear this time
you will not be amongst the old rocks; how I shall rejoice to live to
see you publish and discover another stage below the Silurian--it would
be the grandest step possible, I think. I am very glad to hear what
progress Bunbury is making in fossil Botany; there is a fine hiatus
for him to fill up in this country. I will certainly call on him this
winter...From what little I saw of him, I can quite believe everything
which you say of his talents...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Shrewsbury [1845?].

My dear Hooker,

I have just received your note, which has astonished me, and has most
truly grieved me. I never for one minute doubted of your success, for I
most erroneously imagined, that merit was sure to gain the day. I feel
most sure that the day will come soon, when those who have voted against
you, if they have any shame or conscience in them, will be ashamed at
having allowed politics to blind their eyes to your qualifications,
and those qualifications vouched for by Humboldt and Brown! Well, those
testimonials must be a consolation to you. Proh pudor! I am vexed and
indignant by turns. I cannot even take comfort in thinking that I shall
see more of you, and extract more knowledge from your well-arranged
stock. I am pleased to think, that after having read a few of your
letters, I never once doubted the position you will ultimately hold
amongst European Botanists. I can think about nothing else, otherwise
I should like [to] discuss 'Cosmos' (A translation of Humboldt's
'Kosmos.') with you. I trust you will pay me and my wife a visit this
autumn at Down. I shall be at Down on the 24th, and till then moving
about.

My dear Hooker, allow me to call myself Your very true friend, C.
DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. October 8th [1845], Shrewsbury.

...I have lately been taking a little tour to see a farm I have
purchased in Lincolnshire (He speaks of his Lincolnshire farm in a
letter to Henslow (July 4th):--"I have bought a farm in Lincolnshire,
and when I go there this autumn, I mean to see what I can do in
providing any cottage on my small estate with gardens. It is a hopeless
thing to look to, but I believe few things would do this country more
good in future ages than the destruction of primogeniture, so as to
lessen the difference in land-wealth, and make more small freeholders.
How atrociously unjust are the stamp laws, which render it so expensive
for the poor man to buy his quarter of an acre; it makes one's blood
burn with indignation.") and then to York, where I visited the Dean of
Manchester (Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert. The visit is mentioned in a letter
to Dr. Hooker:--"I have been taking a little tour, partly on business,
and visited the Dean of Manchester, and had very much interesting talk
with him on hybrids, sterility, and variation, etc., etc. He is full of
self-gained knowledge, but knows surprisingly little what others have
done on the same subjects. He is very heterodox on 'species': not much
better as most naturalists would esteem it, than poor Mr. Vestiges.")
the great maker of Hybrids, who gave me much curious information. I also
visited Waterton at Walton Hall, and was extremely amused with my visit
there. He is an amusing strange fellow; at our early dinner, our party
consisted of two Catholic priests and two Mulattresses! He is past
sixty years old, and the day before ran down and caught a leveret in
a turnip-field. It is a fine old house, and the lake swarms with
water-fowl. I then saw Chatsworth, and was in transport with the great
hothouse; it is a perfect fragment of a tropical forest, and the sight
made me think with delight of old recollections. My little ten-day tour
made me feel wonderfully strong at the time, but the good effects did
not last. My wife, I am sorry to say, does not get very strong, and the
children are the hope of the family, for they are all happy, life, and
spirits. I have been much interested with Sedgwick's review (Sedgwick's
review of the 'Vestiges of Creation' in the 'Edinburgh Review,' July,
1845.) though I find it far from popular with our scientific readers.
I think some few passages savour of the dogmatism of the pulpit, rather
than of the philosophy of the Professor's Chair; and some of the wit
strikes me as only worthy of -- in the 'Quarterly.' Nevertheless, it is
a grand piece of argument against mutability of species, and I read it
with fear and trembling, but was well pleased to find that I had not
overlooked any of the arguments, though I had put them to myself as
feebly as milk and water. Have you read 'Cosmos' yet? The English
translation is wretched, and the semi-metaphysico-politico descriptions
in the first part are barely intelligible; but I think the volcanic
discussion well worth your attention, it has astonished me by its vigour
and information. I grieve to find Humboldt an adorer of Von Buch, with
his classification of volcanos, craters of elevation, etc., etc., and
carbonic acid gas atmosphere. He is indeed a wonderful man.

I hope to get home in a fortnight and stick to my wearyful South America
till I finish it. I shall be very anxious to hear how you get on from
the Horners, but you must not think of wasting your time by writing to
me. We shall miss, indeed, your visits to Down, and I shall feel a lost
man in London without my morning "house of call" at Hart Street...

Believe me, my dear Lyell, ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Farnborough, Kent. Thursday,
September, 1846.

My dear Hooker,

I hope this letter will catch you at Clifton, but I have been prevented
writing by being unwell, and having had the Horners here as visitors,
which, with my abominable press-work, has fully occupied my time. It is,
indeed, a long time since we wrote to each other; though, I beg to tell
you, that I wrote last, but what about I cannot remember, except,
I know, it was after reading your last numbers (Sir J.D. Hooker's
Antarctic Botany.), and I send you a uniquely laudatory epistle,
considering it was from a man who hardly knows a Daisy from a Dandelion
to a professed Botanist...

I cannot remember what papers have given me the impression, but I have
that, which you state to be the case, firmly fixed on my mind, namely,
the little chemical importance of the soil to its vegetation. What a
strong fact it is, as R. Brown once remarked to me, of certain plants
being calcareous ones here, which are not so under a more favourable
climate on the Continent, or the reverse, for I forget which; but you,
no doubt, will know to what I refer. By-the-way, there are some such
cases in Herbert's paper in the 'Horticultural Journal.' ('Journal of
the Horticultural Society,' 1846.) Have you read it: it struck me as
extremely original, and bears DIRECTLY on your present researches. (Sir
J.D. Hooker was at this time attending to polymorphism, variability,
etc.) To a NON-BOTANIST the chalk has the most peculiar aspect of any
flora in England; why will you not come here to make your observations?
WE go to Southampton, if my courage and stomach do not fail, for the
Brit. Assoc. (Do you not consider it your duty to be there?) And why
cannot you come here afterward and WORK?...


THE MONOGRAPH OF THE CIRRIPEDIA,

October 1846 to October 1854.

[Writing to Sir J.D. Hooker in 1845, my father says: "I hope this next
summer to finish my South American Geology, then to get out a little
Zoology, and hurrah for my species work..." This passage serves to show
that he had at this time no intention of making an exhaustive study of
the Cirripedes. Indeed it would seem that his original intention was,
as I learn from Sir J.D. Hooker, merely to work out one special
problem. This is quite in keeping with the following passage in the
Autobiography: "When on the coast of Chile, I found a most curious form,
which burrowed into the shells of Concholepas, and which differed so
much from all other Cirripedes that I had to form a new sub-order for
its sole reception...To understand the structure of my new Cirripede I
had to examine and dissect many of the common forms; and this gradually
led me on to take up the whole group." In later years he seems to have
felt some doubt as to the value of these eight years of work,--for
instance when he wrote in his Autobiography--"My work was of
considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in the 'Origin of
Species,' the principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless I
doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time." Yet I
learn from Sir J.D. Hooker that he certainly recognised at the time its
value to himself as systematic training. Sir Joseph writes to me: "Your
father recognised three stages in his career as a biologist: the mere
collector at Cambridge; the collector and observer in the "Beagle", and
for some years afterwards; and the trained naturalist after, and only
after the Cirripede work. That he was a thinker all along is true
enough, and there is a vast deal in his writings previous to the
Cirripedes that a trained naturalist could but emulate...He often
alluded to it as a valued discipline, and added that even the 'hateful'
work of digging out synonyms, and of describing, not only improved his
methods but opened his eyes to the difficulties and merits of the works
of the dullest of cataloguers. One result was that he would never allow
a depreciatory remark to pass unchallenged on the poorest class of
scientific workers, provided that their work was honest, and good of
its kind. I have always regarded it as one of the finest traits of his
character,--this generous appreciation of the hod-men of science, and
of their labours...and it was monographing the Barnacles that brought it
about."]

Professor Huxley allows me to quote his opinion as to the value of the
eight years given to the Cirripedes:--

"In my opinion your sagacious father never did a wiser thing than when
he devoted himself to the years of patient toil which the Cirripede-book
cost him.

"Like the rest of us, he had no proper training in biological science,
and it has always struck me as a remarkable instance of his scientific
insight, that he saw the necessity of giving himself such training, and
of his courage, that he did not shirk the labour of obtaining it.

"The great danger which besets all men of large speculative faculty, is
the temptation to deal with the accepted statements of facts in natural
science, as if they were not only correct, but exhaustive; as if they
might be dealt with deductively, in the same way as propositions in
Euclid may be dealt with. In reality, every such statement, however true
it may be, is true only relatively to the means of observation and the
point of view of those who have enunciated it. So far it may be depended
upon. But whether it will bear every speculative conclusion that may be
logically deduced from it, is quite another question.

"Your father was building a vast superstructure upon the foundations
furnished by the recognised facts of geological and biological science.
In Physical Geography, in Geology proper, in Geographical Distribution,
and in Palaeontology, he had acquired an extensive practical training
during the voyage of the "Beagle". He knew of his own knowledge the way
in which the raw materials of these branches of science are acquired,
and was therefore a most competent judge of the speculative strain they
would bear. That which he needed, after his return to England, was
a corresponding acquaintance with Anatomy and Development, and their
relation to Taxonomy--and he acquired this by his Cirripede work.

"Thus, in my apprehension, the value of the Cirripede monograph lies
not merely in the fact that it is a very admirable piece of work, and
constituted a great addition to positive knowledge, but still more in
the circumstance that it was a piece of critical self-discipline,
the effect of which manifested itself in everything your father wrote
afterwards, and saved him from endless errors of detail.

"So far from such work being a loss of time, I believe it would have
been well worth his while, had it been practicable, to have supplemented
it by a special study of embryology and physiology. His hands would
have been greatly strengthened thereby when he came to write out sundry
chapters of the 'Origin of Species.' But of course in those days it was
almost impossible for him to find facilities for such work."

No one can look a the two volumes on the recent Cirripedes, of 399
and 684 pages respectively (not to speak of the volumes on the fossil
species), without being struck by the immense amount of detailed work
which they contain. The forty plates, some of them with thirty figures,
and the fourteen pages of index in the two volumes together, give some
rough idea of the labour spent on the work. (The reader unacquainted
with Zoology will find some account of the more interesting results in
Mr. Romanes' article on "Charles Darwin" ('Nature' Series, 1882).) The
state of knowledge, as regards the Cirripedes, was most unsatisfactory
at the time that my father began to work at them. As an illustration
of this fact, it may be mentioned that he had even to re-organise the
nomenclature of the group, or, as he expressed it, he "unwillingly found
it indispensable to give names to several valves, and to some few of
the softer parts of Cirripedes." (Vol. i. page 3.) It is interesting
to learn from his diary the amount of time which he gave to different
genera. Thus the genus Chthamalus, the description of which occupies
twenty-two pages, occupied him for thirty-six days; Coronula took
nineteen days, and is described in twenty-seven pages. Writing to
Fitz-Roy, he speaks of being "for the last half-month daily hard at work
in dissecting a little animal about the size of a pin's head, from the
Chonos archipelago, and I could spend another month, and daily see more
beautiful structure."

Though he became excessively weary of the work before the end of the
eight years, he had much keen enjoyment in the course of it. Thus
he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker (1847?):--"As you say, there is an
extraordinary pleasure in pure observation; not but what I suspect the
pleasure in this case is rather derived from comparisons forming in
one's mind with allied structures. After having been so long employed
in writing my old geological observations, it is delightful to use one's
eyes and fingers again." It was, in fact, a return to the work which
occupied so much of his time when at sea during his voyage. His
zoological notes of that period give an impression of vigorous work,
hampered by ignorance and want of appliances. And his untiring industry
in the dissection of marine animals, especially of Crustacea, must have
been of value to him as training for his Cirripede work. Most of his
work was done with the simple dissecting microscope--but it was the need
which he found for higher powers that induced him, in 1846, to buy a
compound microscope. He wrote to Hooker:--"When I was drawing with L.,
I was so delighted with the appearance of the objects, especially with
their perspective, as seen through the weak powers of a good compound
microscope, that I am going to order one; indeed, I often have
structures in which the 1/30 is not power enough."

During part of the time covered by the present chapter, my father
suffered perhaps more from ill-health than at any other time of his
life. He felt severely the depressing influence of these long years of
illness; thus as early as 1840 he wrote to Fox: "I am grown a dull,
old, spiritless dog to what I used to be. One gets stupider as one grows
older I think." It is not wonderful that he should so have written,
it is rather to be wondered at that his spirit withstood so great and
constant a strain. He wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker in 1845: "You are very
kind in your enquiries about my health; I have nothing to say about it,
being always much the same, some days better and some worse. I believe
I have not had one whole day, or rather night, without my stomach having
been greatly disordered, during the last three years, and most days
great prostration of strength: thank you for your kindness; many of my
friends, I believe, think me a hypochondriac."

Again, in 1849, he notes in his diary:--"January 1st to March
10th.--Health very bad, with much sickness and failure of power. Worked
on all well days." This was written just before his first visit to Dr.
Gully's Water-Cure Establishment at Malvern. In April of the same year
he wrote:--"I believe I am going on very well, but I am rather weary of
my present inactive life, and the water-cure has the most extraordinary
effect in producing indolence and stagnation of mind: till experiencing
it, I could not have believed it possible. I now increase in weight,
have escaped sickness for thirty days." He returned in June, after
sixteen weeks' absence, much improved in health, and, as already
described, continued the water-cure at home for some time.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [October, 1846].

My dear Hooker,

I have not heard from Sulivan (Admiral Sir B.J. Sulivan, formerly an
officer of the "Beagle".) lately; when he last wrote he named from 8th
to 10th as the most likely time. Immediately that I hear, I will fly you
a line, for the chance of your being able to come. I forget whether you
know him, but I suppose so; he is a real good fellow. Anyhow, if you do
not come then, I am very glad that you propose coming soon after...

I am going to begin some papers on the lower marine animals, which will
last me some months, perhaps a year, and then I shall begin looking over
my ten-year-long accumulation of notes on species and varieties,
which, with writing, I dare say will take me five years, and then, when
published, I dare say I shall stand infinitely low in the opinion of all
sound Naturalists--so this is my prospect for the future.

Are you a good hand at inventing names. I have a quite new and curious
genus of Barnacle, which I want to name, and how to invent a name
completely puzzles me.

By the way, I have told you nothing about Southampton. We enjoyed (wife
and myself) our week beyond measure: the papers were all dull, but I met
so many friends and made so many new acquaintances (especially some of
the Irish Naturalists), and took so many pleasant excursions. I wish you
had been there. On Sunday we had so pleasant an excursion to
Winchester with Falconer (Hugh Falconer, 1809-1865. Chiefly known as a
palaeontologist, although employed as a botanist during his whole career
in India, where he was also a medical officer in the H.E.I.C. Service;
he was superintendent of the Company's garden, first at Saharunpore,
and then at Calcutta. He was one of the first botanical explorers of
Kashmir. Falconer's discoveries of Miocene mammalian remains in the
Sewalik Hills, were, at the time, perhaps the greatest "finds" which had
been made. His book on the subject, 'Fauna Antiqua Sivalensis,' remained
unfinished at the time of his death.), Colonel Sabine (The late Sir
Edward Sabine, formerly President of the Royal Society, and author of a
long series of memoirs on Terrestrial Magnetism.), and Dr. Robinson
(The late Dr. Thomas Romney Robinson, of the Armagh Observatory.), and
others. I never enjoyed a day more in my life. I missed having a look
at H. Watson. (The late Hewett Cottrell Watson, author of the 'Cybele
Britannica,' one of a most valuable series of works on the topography
and geographical distribution of the plants of the British Islands.)
I suppose you heard that he met Forbes and told him he had a severe
article in the Press. I understood that Forbes explained to him that he
had no cause to complain, but as the article was printed, he would not
withdraw it, but offered it to Forbes for him to append notes to it,
which Forbes naturally declined...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 7th [1847?].

My dear Hooker,

I should have written before now, had I not been almost continually
unwell, and at present I am suffering from four boils and swellings, one
of which hardly allows me the use of my right arm, and has stopped all
my work, and damped all my spirits. I was much disappointed at missing
my trip to Kew, and the more so, as I had forgotten you would be away
all this month; but I had no choice, and was in bed nearly all Friday
and Saturday. I congratulate you over your improved prospects about
India (Sir J. Hooker left England on November 11, 1847, for his
Himalayan and Tibetan journey. The expedition was supported by a small
grant from the Treasury, and thus assumed the character of a Government
mission.), but at the same time must sincerely groan over it. I shall
feel quite lost without you to discuss many points with, and to
point out (ill-luck to you) difficulties and objections to my species
hypotheses. It will be a horrid shame if money stops your expedition;
but Government will surely help you to some extent...Your present trip,
with your new views, amongst the coal-plants, will be very interesting.
If you have spare time, BUT NOT WITHOUT, I should enjoy having some news
of your progress. Your present trip will work well in, if you go to
any of the coal districts in India. Would this not be a good object to
parade before Government; the utilitarian souls would comprehend this.
By the way, I will get some work out of you, about the domestic races of
animals in India...


CHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS (BLOMEFIELD). Down [1847].

Dear Jenyns,

("This letter relates to a small Almanack first published in 1843, under
the name of 'The Naturalists' Pocket Almanack,' by Mr. Van Voorst,
and which I edited for him. It was intended especially for those who
interest themselves in the periodic phenomena of animals and plants, of
which a select list was given under each month of the year.

"The Pocket Almanack contained, moreover, miscellaneous information
relating to Zoology and Botany; to Natural History and other scientific
societies; to public Museums and Gardens, in addition to the ordinary
celestial phenomena found in most other Almanacks. It continued to be
issued till 1847, after which year the publication was abandoned."--From
a letter from Rev. L. Blomefield to F. Darwin.)

I am very much obliged for the capital little Almanack; it so happened
that I was wishing for one to keep in my portfolio. I had never seen
this kind before, and shall certainly get one for the future. I think
it is very amusing to have a list before one's eyes of the order of
appearance of the plants and animals around one; it gives a fresh
interest to each fine day. There is one point I should like to see
a little improved, viz., the correction for the clock at shorter
intervals. Most people, I suspect, who like myself have dials, will wish
to be more precise than with a margin of three minutes. I always buy
a shilling almanack for this SOLE end. By the way, YOURS, i.e., Van
Voorst's Almanack, is very dear; it ought, at least, to be advertised
post-free for the shilling. Do you not think a table (not rules) of
conversion of French into English measures, and perhaps weights, would
be exceedingly useful; also centigrade into Fahrenheit,--magnifying
powers according to focal distances?--in fact you might make it the more
useful publication of the age. I know what I should like best of all,
namely, current meteorological remarks for each month, with statement
of average course of winds and prediction of weather, in accordance with
movements of barometer. People, I think, are always amused at knowing
the extremes and means of temperature for corresponding times in other
years.

I hope you will go on with it another year. With many thanks, my dear
Jenyns,

Yours very truly, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Sunday [April 18th, 1847].

My dear Hooker,

I return with many thanks Watson's letter, which I have had copied. It
is a capital one, and I am extremely obliged to you for obtaining me
such valuable information. Surely he is rather in a hurry when he says
intermediate varieties must almost be necessarily rare, otherwise they
would be taken as the types of the species; for he overlooks numerical
frequency as an element. Surely if A, B, C were three varieties, and
if A were a good deal the commonest (therefore, also, first known),
it would be taken as the type, without regarding whether B was quite
intermediate or not, or whether it was rare or not. What capital
essays W would write; but I suppose he has written a good deal in the
'Phytologist.' You ought to encourage him to publish on variation; it
is a shame that such facts as those in his letter should remain
unpublished. I must get you to introduce me to him; would he be a good
and sociable man for Dropmore? (A much enjoyed expedition made from
Oxford--when the British Association met there in 1847.) though if he
comes, Forbes must not (and I think you talked of inviting Forbes), or
we shall have a glorious battle. I should like to see sometime the war
correspondence. Have you the 'Phytologist,' and could you sometime spare
it? I would go through it quickly...I have read your last five numbers
(Of the Botany of Hooker's 'Antarctic Voyage.'), and as usual have been
much interested in several points, especially with your discussions
on the beech and potato. I see you have introduced several sentences
against us Transmutationists. I have also been looking through the
latter volumes of the 'Annals of Natural History,' and have read two
such soulless, pompous papers of --, quite worthy of the author...The
contrast of the papers in the "Annals" with those in the "Annales"
is rather humiliating; so many papers in the former, with short
descriptions of species, without one word on their affinities, internal
structure, range or habits. I am now reading --, and I have picked
out some things which have interested me; but he strikes me as rather
dullish, and with all his Materia Medica smells of the doctor's shop. I
shall ever hate the name of the Materia Medica, since hearing Duncan's
lectures at eight o'clock on a winter's morning--a whole, cold
breakfastless hour on the properties of rhubarb!

I hope your journey will be very prosperous. Believe me, my dear Hooker,

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--I think I have only made one new acquaintance of late, that is
R. Chambers; and I have just received a presentation copy of the sixth
edition of the 'Vestiges.' Somehow I now feel perfectly convinced he is
the author. He is in France, and has written to me thence.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1847?].

...I am delighted to hear that Brongniart thought Sigillaria aquatic,
and that Binney considers coal a sort of submarine peat. I would bet
5 to 1 that in twenty years this will be generally admitted (An
unfulfilled prophecy.); and I do not care for whatever the botanical
difficulties or impossibilities may be. If I could but persuade myself
that Sigillaria and Co. had a good range of depth, i.e., could live from
5 to 100 fathoms under water, all difficulties of nearly all kinds would
be removed (for the simple fact of muddy ordinary shallow sea implies
proximity of land). [N.B.--I am chuckling to think how you are sneering
all this time.] It is not much of a difficulty, there not being shells
with the coal, considering how unfavourable deep mud is for most
Mollusca, and that shells would probably decay from the humic acid, as
seems to take place in peat and in the BLACK moulds (as Lyell tells me)
of the Mississippi. So coal question settled--Q.E.D. Sneer away!

Many thanks for your welcome note from Cambridge, and I am glad you like
my alma mater, which I despise heartily as a place of education, but
love from many most pleasant recollections...

Thanks for your offer of the 'Phytologist;' I shall be very much obliged
for it, for I do not suppose I should be able to borrow it from any
other quarter. I will not be set up too much by your praise, but I do
not believe I ever lost a book or forgot to return it during a long
lapse of time. Your 'Webb' is well wrapped up, and with your name in

My new microscope is come home (a "splendid plaything," as old R.
Brown called it), and I am delighted with it; it really is a splendid
plaything. I have been in London for three days, and saw many of our
friends. I was extremely sorry to hear a not very good account of
Sir William. Farewell, my dear Hooker, and be a good boy, and make
Sigillaria a submarine sea-weed.

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [May 6th, 1847].

My dear Hooker,

You have made a savage onslaught, and I must try to defend myself.
But, first, let me say that I never write to you except for my own
good pleasure; now I fear that you answer me when busy and without
inclination (and I am sure I should have none if I was as busy as you).
Pray do not do so, and if I thought my writing entailed an answer from
you nolens volens, it would destroy all my pleasure in writing. Firstly,
I did not consider my letter as REASONING, or even as SPECULATION, but
simply as mental rioting; and as I was sending Binney's paper, I poured
out to you the result of reading it. Secondly, you are right, indeed, in
thinking me mad, if you suppose that I would class any ferns as marine
plants; but surely there is a wide distinction between the plants found
upright in the coal-beds and those not upright, and which might have
been drifted. Is it not possible that the same circumstances which have
preserved the vegetation in situ, should have preserved drifted plants?
I know Calamites is found upright; but I fancied its affinities were
very obscure, like Sigillaria. As for Lepidodendron, I forgot its
existence, as happens when one goes riot, and now know neither what
it is, or whether upright. If these plants, i.e. Calamites and
Lepidodendron, have VERY CLEAR RELATIONS to terrestrial vegetables, like
the ferns have, and are found upright in situ, of course I must give up
the ghost. But surely Sigillaria is the main upright plant, and on its
obscure affinities I have heard you enlarge.

Thirdly, it never entered my head to undervalue botanical relatively to
zoological evidence; except in so far as I thought it was admitted that
the vegetative structure seldom yielded any evidence of affinity nearer
than that of families, and not always so much. And is it not in plants,
as certainly it is in animals, dangerous to judge of habits without
very near affinity. Could a Botanist tell from structure alone that the
Mangrove family, almost or quite alone in Dicotyledons, could live in
the sea, and the Zostera family almost alone among the Monocotyledons?
Is it a safe argument, that because algae are almost the only, or the
only submerged sea-plants, that formerly other groups had not members
with such habits? With animals such an argument would not be conclusive,
as I could illustrate by many examples; but I am forgetting myself; I
want only to some degree to defend myself, and not burn my fingers by
attacking you. The foundation of my letter, and what is my deliberate
opinion, though I dare say you will think it absurd, is that I would
rather trust, caeteris paribus, pure geological evidence than either
zoological or botanical evidence. I do not say that I would sooner trust
POOR geological evidence than GOOD organic. I think the basis of pure
geological reasoning is simpler (consisting chiefly of the action of
water on the crust of the earth, and its up and down movements) than a
basis drawn from the difficult subject of affinities and of structure in
relation to habits. I can hardly analyze the facts on which I have come
to this conclusion; but I can illustrate it. Pallas's account would lead
any one to suppose that the Siberian strata, with the frozen carcasses,
had been quickly deposited, and hence that the embedded animals had
lived in the neighbourhood; but our zoological knowledge of thirty years
ago led every one falsely to reject this conclusion.

Tell me that an upright fern in situ occurs with Sigillaria and
Stigmaria, or that the affinities of Calamites and Lepidodendron
(supposing that they are found in situ with Sigillaria) are so CLEAR,
that they could not have been marine, like, but in a greater degree,
than the mangrove and sea-wrack, and I will humbly apologise to you
and all Botanists for having let my mind run riot on a subject on which
assuredly I know nothing. But till I hear this, I shall keep privately
to my own opinion with the same pertinacity and, as you will think,
with the same philosophical spirit with which Koenig maintains that
Cheirotherium-footsteps are fuci.

Whether this letter will sink me lower in your opinion, or put me a
little right, I know not, but hope the latter. Anyhow, I have revenged
myself with boring you with a very long epistle. Farewell, and be
forgiving. Ever yours,

C. DARWIN.

P.S.--When will you return to Kew? I have forgotten one main object of
my letter, to thank you MUCH for your offer of the 'Hort. Journal,' but
I have ordered the two numbers.


[The two following extracts [1847] give the continuation and conclusion
of the coal battle.

"By the way, as submarine coal made you so wrath, I thought I would
experimentise on Falconer and Bunbury (The late Sir C. Bunbury,
well-known as a palaeobotanist.) together, and it made [them] even more
savage; 'such infernal nonsense ought to be thrashed out of me.' Bunbury
was more polite and contemptuous. So I now know how to stir up and show
off any Botanist. I wonder whether Zoologists and Geologists have got
their tender points; I wish I could find out."

"I cannot resist thanking you for your most kind note. Pray do not
think that I was annoyed by your letter: I perceived that you had been
thinking with animation, and accordingly expressed yourself strongly,
and so I understood it. Forfend me from a man who weighs every
expression with Scotch prudence. I heartily wish you all success in your
noble problem, and I shall be very curious to have some talk with you
and hear your ultimatum."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. (Parts of two letters.) Down [October,
1847].

I congratulate you heartily on your arrangements being completed, with
some prospect for the future. It will be a noble voyage and journey,
but I wish it was over, I shall miss you selfishly and all ways to a
dreadful extent ...I am in great perplexity how we are to meet...I can
well understand how dreadfully busy you must be. If you CANNOT come
here, you MUST let me come to you for a night; for I must have one more
chat and one more quarrel with you over the coal.

By the way, I endeavoured to stir up Lyell (who has been staying
here some days with me) to theorise on the coal: his oolitic UPRIGHT
Equisetums are dreadful for my submarine flora. I should die much easier
if some one would solve me the coal question. I sometimes think it could
not have been formed at all. Old Sir Anthony Carlisle once said to me
gravely, that he supposed Megatherium and such cattle were just sent
down from heaven to see whether the earth would support them; and I
suppose the coal was rained down to puzzle mortals. You must work the
coal well in India.

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [November 6th, 1847.]

My dear Hooker,

I have just received your note with sincere grief: there is no help for
it. I shall always look at your intention of coming here, under such
circumstances, as the greatest proof of friendship I ever received from
mortal man. My conscience would have upbraided me in not having come
to you on Thursday, but, as it turned out, I could not, for I was quite
unable to leave Shrewsbury before that day, and I reached home only
last night, much knocked up. Without I hear to-morrow (which is hardly
possible), and if I am feeling pretty well, I will drive over to Kew on
Monday morning, just to say farewell. I will stay only an hour...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [November, 1847.]

My dear Hooker,

I am very unwell, and incapable of doing anything. I do hope I have not
inconvenienced you. I was so unwell all yesterday, that I was rejoicing
you were not here; for it would have been a bitter mortification to me
to have had you here and not enjoyed your last day. I shall not now see
you. Farewell, and God bless you.

Your affectionate friend, C. DARWIN.

I will write to you in India.


[In 1847 appeared a paper by Mr. D. Milne (Now Mr. Milne Home. The
essay was published in Transactions of the Edinburgh Royal Society, vol.
xvi.), in which my father's Glen Roy work is criticised, and which is
referred to in the following characteristic extract from a letter to Sir
J. Hooker:] "I have been bad enough for these few last days, having had
to think and write too much about Glen Roy...Mr. Milne having attacked
my theory, which made me horribly sick." I have not been able to find
any published reply to Mr. Milne, so that I imagine the "writing"
mentioned was confined to letters. Mr. Milne's paper was not destructive
to the Glen Roy paper, and this my father recognises in the following
extract from a letter to Lyell (March, 1847). The reference to Chambers
is explained by the fact that he accompanied Mr. Milne in his visit to
Glen Roy. "I got R. Chambers to give me a sketch of Milne's Glen Roy
views, and I have re-read my paper, and am, now that I have heard what
is to be said, not even staggered. It is provoking and humiliating to
find that Chambers not only had not read with any care my paper on
this subject, or even looked at the coloured map, so that the new shelf
described by me had not been searched for, and my arguments and facts of
detail not in the least attended to. I entirely gave up the ghost, and
was quite chicken-hearted at the Geological Society, till you reassured
and reminded me of the main facts in the whole case."


The two following letters to Lyell, though of later date (June, 1848),
bear on the same subject:--

"I was at the evening meeting [of the Geological Society], but did not
get within hail of you. What a fool (though I must say a very amusing
one) -- did make of himself. Your speech was refreshing after it,
and was well characterized by Fox (my cousin) in three words--'What a
contrast!' That struck me as a capital speculation about the Wealden
Continent going down. I did not hear what you settled at the Council; I
was quite wearied out and bewildered. I find Smith, of Jordan Hill, has
a much worse opinion of R. Chambers's book than even I have. Chambers
has piqued me a little ('Ancient Sea Margins, 1848.' The words quoted by
my father should be "the mobility of the land was an ascendant idea.");
he says I 'propound' and 'profess my belief' that Glen Roy is marine,
and that the idea was accepted because the 'mobility of the land was the
ascendant idea of the day.' He adds some very faint UPPER lines in Glen
Spean (seen, by the way, by Agassiz), and has shown that Milne and Kemp
are right in there being horizontal aqueous markings (NOT at coincident
levels with those of Glen Roy) in other parts of Scotland at great
heights, and he adds several other cases. This is the whole of his
addition to the data. He not only takes my line of argument from the
buttresses and terraces below the lower shelf and some other arguments
(without acknowledgment), but he sneers at all his predecessors
not having perceived the importance of the short portions of lines
intermediate between the chief ones in Glen Roy; whereas I commence the
description of them with saying, that 'perceiving their importance,
I examined them with scrupulous care,' and expatiate at considerable
length on them. I have indirectly told him I do not think he has quite
claims to consider that he alone (which he pretty directly asserts) has
solved the problem of Glen Roy. With respect to the terraces at lower
levels coincident in height all round Scotland and England, I am
inclined to believe he shows some little probability of there being some
leading ones coincident, but much more exact evidence is required. Would
you believe it credible? he advances as a probable solution to account
for the rise of Great Britain that in some great ocean one-twentieth
of the bottom of the whole aqueous surface of the globe has sunk in (he
does not say where he puts it) for a thickness of half a mile, and this
he has calculated would make an apparent rise of 130 feet."


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down [June, 1848].

My dear Lyell,

Out of justice to Chambers I must trouble you with one line to say, as
far as I am personally concerned in Glen Roy, he has made the amende
honorable, and pleads guilty through inadvertency of taking my two lines
of arguments and facts without acknowledgment. He concluded by saying he
"came to the same point by an independent course of inquiry, which in a
small degree excuses this inadvertency." His letter altogether shows a
very good disposition, and says he is "much gratified with the MEASURED
approbation which you bestow, etc." I am heartily glad I was able to
say in truth that I thought he had done good service in calling more
attention to the subject of the terraces. He protests it is unfair to
call the sinking of the sea his theory, for that he with care always
speaks of mere change of level, and this is quite true; but the one
section in which he shows how he conceives the sea might sink is so
astonishing, that I believe it will with others, as with me, more than
counterbalance his previous caution. I hope that you may think better of
the book than I do.

Yours most truly, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. October 6th, 1848.

...I have lately been trying to get up an agitation (but I shall not
succeed, and indeed doubt whether I have time and strength to go on with
it), against the practice of Naturalists appending for perpetuity the
name of the FIRST describer to species. I look at this as a direct
premium to hasty work, to NAMING instead of DESCRIBING. A species ought
to have a name so well known that the addition of the author's name
would be superfluous, and a [piece] of empty vanity. (His contempt for
the self-regarding spirit in a naturalist is illustrated by an anecdote,
for which I am indebted to Rev. L. Blomefield. After speaking of my
father's love of Entomology at Cambridge, Mr. Blomefield continues:--"He
occasionally came over from Cambridge to my Vicarage at Swaffham
Bulbeck, and we went out together to collect insects in the woods at
Bottisham Hall, close at hand, or made longer excursions in the Fens.
On one occasion he captured in a large bag net, with which he used
vigorously to sweep the weeds and long grass, a rare coleopterous
insect, one of the Lepturidae, which I myself had never taken in
Cambridgeshire. He was pleased with his capture, and of course carried
it home in triumph. Some years afterwards, the voyage of the 'Beagle'
having been made in the interim, talking over old times with him, I
reverted to this circumstance, and asked if he remembered it. 'Oh, yes,'
(he said,) 'I remember it well; and I was selfish enough to keep
the specimen, when you were collecting materials for a Fauna of
Cambridgeshire, and for a local museum in the Philosophical Society.' He
followed this up with some remarks on the pettiness of collectors, who
aimed at nothing beyond filling their cabinets with rare things.")
At present, it would not do to give mere specific names; but I think
Zoologists might open the road to the omission, by referring to good
systematic writers instead of to first describers. Botany, I fancy,
has not suffered so much as Zoology from mere NAMING; the characters,
fortunately, are more obscure. Have you ever thought on this point?
Why should Naturalists append their own names to new species, when
Mineralogists and Chemists do not do so to new substances? When you
write to Falconer pray remember me affectionately to him. I grieve most
sincerely to hear that he has been ill, my dear Hooker, God bless you,
and fare you well.

Your sincere friend, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO HUGH STRICKLAND. (Hugh Edwin Strickland, M.A., F.R.S.,
was born 2nd of March, 1811, and educated at Rugby, under Arnold, and at
Oriel College, Oxford. In 1835 and 1836 he travelled through Europe to
the Levant with W.J. Hamilton, the geologist, wintering in Asia Minor.
In 1841 he brought the subject of Natural History Nomenclature before
the British Association, and prepared the Code of Rules for Zoological
Nomenclature, now known by his name--the principles of which are very
generally adopted. In 1843 he was one of the founders (if not the
original projector) of the Ray Society. In 1845 he married the second
daughter of Sir William Jardine, Bart. In 1850 he was appointed, in
consequence of Buckland's illness, Deputy Reader in Geology at Oxford.
His promising career was suddenly cut short on September 14, 1853, when,
while geologizing in a railway cutting between Retford and Gainsborough,
he was run over by a train and instantly killed. A memoir of him and a
reprint of his principal contributions to journals was published by Sir
William Jardine in 1858; but he was also the author of 'The Dodo and its
Kindred' (1848); 'Bibliographia Zoologiae' (the latter in conjunction
with Louis Agassiz, and issued by the Ray Society); 'Ornithological
Synonyms' (one volume only published, and that posthumously). A
catalogue of his ornithological collection, given by his widow to the
University of Cambridge, was compiled by Mr. Salvin, and published in
1882. (I am indebted to Prof. Newton for the above note.)) Down, January
29th [1849].

...What a labour you have undertaken; I do HONOUR your devoted zeal in
the good cause of Natural Science. Do you happen to have a SPARE copy
of the Nomenclature rules published in the 'British Association
Transactions?' if you have, and would give it to me, I should be truly
obliged, for I grudge buying the volume for it. I have found the rules
very useful, it is quite a comfort to have something to rest on in the
turbulent ocean of nomenclature (and am accordingly grateful to you),
though I find it very difficult to obey always. Here is a case (and I
think it should have been noticed in the rules), Coronula, Cineras and
Otion, are names adopted by Cuvier, Lamarck, Owen, and almost EVERY
well-known writer, but I find that all three names were anticipated by
a German: now I believe if I were to follow the strict rule of priority,
more harm would be done than good, and more especially as I feel sure
that the newly fished-up names would not be adopted. I have almost made
up my mind to reject the rule of priority in this case; would you grudge
the trouble to send me your opinion? I have been led of late to reflect
much on the subject of naming, and I have come to a fixed opinion that
the plan of the first describer's name, being appended for perpetuity to
a species, had been the greatest curse to Natural History. Some months
since, I wrote out the enclosed badly drawn-up paper, thinking that
perhaps I would agitate the subject; but the fit has passed, and I do
not suppose I ever shall; I send it you for the CHANCE of your caring
to see my notions. I have been surprised to find in conversation that
several naturalists were of nearly my way of thinking. I feel sure as
long as species-mongers have their vanity tickled by seeing their own
names appended to a species, because they miserably described it in two
or three lines, we shall have the same VAST amount of bad work as at
present, and which is enough to dishearten any man who is willing to
work out any branch with care and time. I find every genus of Cirripedia
has half-a-dozen names, and not one careful description of any one
species in any one genus. I do not believe that this would have been the
case if each man knew that the memory of his own name depended on his
doing his work well, and not upon merely appending a name with a few
wretched lines indicating only a few prominent external characters. But
I will not weary you with any longer tirade. Read my paper or NOT, just
as you like, and return it whenever you please.

Yours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.


HUGH STRICKLAND TO CHARLES DARWIN. The Lodge, Tewkesbury, January 31st,
1849.

...I have next to notice your second objection--that retaining the name
of the FIRST describer in perpetuum along with that of the species, is
a premium on hasty and careless work. This is quite a different question
from that of the law of priority itself, and it never occurred to me
before, though it seems highly probable that the general recognition of
that law may produce such a result. We must try to counteract this evil
in some other way.

The object of appending the name of a man to the name of a species is
not to gratify the vanity of the man, but to indicate more precisely
the species. Sometimes two men will, by accident, give the same name
(independently) to two species of the same genus. More frequently a
later author will misapply the specific name of an older one. Thus the
Helix putris of Montagu is not H. putris of Linnaeus, though Montague
supposed it to be so. In such a case we cannot define the species by
Helix putris alone, but must append the name of the author whom we
quote. But when a species has never borne but one name (as Corvus
frugilegus), and no other species of Corvus has borne the same name,
it is, of course, unnecessary to add the author's name. Yet even here
I like the form Corvus frugilegus, Linn., as it reminds us that this
is one of the old species, long known, and to be found in the 'Systema
Naturae,' etc. I fear, therefore, that (at least until our nomenclature
is more definitely settled) it will be impossible to indicate species
with scientific accuracy, without adding the name of their first author.
You may, indeed, do it as you propose, by saying in Lam. An. Invert.,
etc., but then this would be incompatible with the law of priority, for
where Lamarck has violated that low, one cannot adopt his name. It is,
nevertheless, highly conducive to accurate indication to append to the
(oldest) specific name ONE good reference to a standard work, especially
to a FIGURE, with an accompanying synonym if necessary. This method may
be cumbrous, but cumbrousness is a far less evil than uncertainty.

It, moreover, seems hardly possible to carry out the PRIORITY principle,
without the historical aid afforded by appending the author's name
to the specific one. If I, a PRIORITY MAN, called a species C.D., it
implies that C.D. is the oldest name that I know of; but in order
that you and others may judge of the propriety of that name, you must
ascertain when, and by whom, the name was first coined. Now, if to the
specific name C.D., I append the name A.B., of its first describer, I at
once furnish you with the clue to the dates when, and the book in which,
this description was given, and I thus assist you in determining whether
C.D. be really the oldest, and therefore the correct, designation.

I do, however, admit that the priority principle (excellent as it is)
has a tendency, when the author's name is added, to encourage vanity and
slovenly work. I think, however, that much might be done to discourage
those obscure and unsatisfactory definitions of which you so justly
complain, by WRITING DOWN the practice. Let the better disposed
naturalists combine to make a formal protest against all vague, loose,
and inadequate definitions of (supposed) new species. Let a committee
(say of the British Association) be appointed to prepare a sort of CLASS
LIST of the various modern works in which new species are described,
arranged in order of merit. The lowest class would contain the worst
examples of the kind, and their authors would thus be exposed to
the obloquy which they deserve, and be gibbeted in terrorem for the
edification of those who may come after.

I have thus candidly stated my views (I hope intelligibly) of what
seems best to be done in the present transitional and dangerous state
of systematic zoology. Innumerable labourers, many of them crotchety and
half-educated, are rushing into the field, and it depends, I think, on
the present generation whether the science is to descend to posterity a
chaotic mass, or possessed of some traces of law and organisation. If we
could only get a congress of deputies from the chief scientific bodies
of Europe and America, something might be done, but, as the case stands,
I confess I do not clearly see my way, beyond humbly endeavouring to
reform NUMBER ONE.

Yours ever, H.E. STRICKLAND.


CHARLES DARWIN TO HUGH STRICKLAND. Down, Sunday [February 4th, 1849].

My dear Strickland,

I am, in truth, GREATLY obliged to you for your long, most interesting,
and clear letter, and the Report. I will consider your arguments, which
are of the greatest weight, but I confess I cannot yet bring myself to
reject very WELL-KNOWN names, not in ONE country, but over the world,
for obscure ones,--simply on the ground that I do not believe I should
be followed. Pray believe that I should break the law of priority only
in rare cases; will you read the enclosed (and return it), and tell me
whether it does not stagger you? (N.B. I PROMISE that I will not give
you any more trouble.) I want simple answers, and not for you to waste
your time in reasons; I am curious for your answer in regard to Balanus.
I put the case of Otion, etc., to W. Thompson, who is fierce for the
law of priority, and he gave it up in such well-known names. I am in
a perfect maze of doubt on nomenclature. In not one large genus of
Cirripedia has ANY ONE species been correctly defined; it is pure
guesswork (being guided by range and commonness and habits) to recognise
any species: thus I can make out, from plates or descriptions, hardly
any of the British sessile cirripedes. I cannot bear to give new names
to all the species, and yet I shall perhaps do wrong to attach old names
by little better than guess; I cannot at present tell the least which
of two species all writers have meant by the common Anatifera laevis;
I have, therefore, given that name to the one which is rather the
commonest. Literally, not one species is properly defined; not one
naturalist has ever taken the trouble to open the shell of any species
to describe it scientifically, and yet all the genera have half-a-dozen
synonyms. For ARGUMENT'S sake, suppose I do my work thoroughly well,
any one who happens to have the original specimens named, I will say by
Chenu, who has figured and named hundreds of species, will be able to
upset all my names according to the law of priority (for he may maintain
his descriptions are sufficient), do you think it advantageous to
science that this should be done: I think not, and that convenience and
high merit (here put as mere argument) had better come into some play.
The subject is heart-breaking.

I hope you will occasionally turn in your mind my argument of the evil
done by the "mihi" attached to specific names; I can most clearly see
the EXCESSIVE evil it has caused; in mineralogy I have myself found
there is no rage to merely name; a person does not take up the subject
without he intends to work it out, as he knows that his ONLY claim to
merit rests on his work being ably done, and has no relation whatever
to NAMING. I give up one point, and grant that reference to first
describer's name should be given in all systematic works, but I think
something would be gained if a reference was given without the author's
name being actually appended as part of the binomial name, and I think,
except in systematic works, a reference, such as I propose, would
damp vanity much. I think a very wrong spirit runs through all Natural
History, as if some merit was due to a man for merely naming and
defining a species; I think scarcely any, or none, is due; if he works
out MINUTELY and anatomically any one species, or systematically a whole
group, credit is due, but I must think the mere defining a species is
nothing, and that no INJUSTICE is done him if it be overlooked, though
a great inconvenience to Natural History is thus caused. I do not think
more credit is due to a man for defining a species, than to a carpenter
for making a box. But I am foolish and rabid against species-mongers, or
rather against their vanity; it is useful and necessary work which must
be done; but they act as if they had actually made the species, and it
was their own property.

I use Agassiz's nomenclator; at least two-thirds of the dates in the
Cirripedia are grossly wrong.

I shall do what I can in fossil Cirripedia, and should be very grateful
for specimens; but I do not believe that species (and hardly genera)
can be defined by single valves; as in every recent species yet examined
their forms vary greatly: to describe a species by valves alone, is the
same as to describe a crab from SMALL portions of its carapace alone,
these portions being highly variable, and not, as in Crustacea, modelled
over viscera. I sincerely apologise for the trouble which I have given
you, but indeed I will give no more.

Yours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--In conversation I found Owen and Andrew Smith much inclined to
throw over the practice of attaching authors' names; I believe if I
agitated I could get a large party to join. W. Thompson agreed some way
with me, but was not prepared to go nearly as far as I am.


CHARLES DARWIN TO HUGH STRICKLAND. Down, February 10th [1849].

My dear Strickland,

I have again to thank you cordially for your letter. Your remarks shall
fructify to some extent, and I will try to be more faithful to rigid
virtue and priority; but as for calling Balanus "Lepas" (which I did not
think of), I cannot do it, my pen won't write it--it is IMPOSSIBLE. I
have great hopes some of my difficulties will disappear, owing to wrong
dates in Agassiz, and to my having to run several genera into one, for I
have as yet gone, in but few cases, to original sources. With respect to
adopting my own notions in my Cirripedia book, I should not like to
do so without I found others approved, and in some public way,--nor,
indeed, is it well adapted, as I can never recognise a species without I
have the original specimen, which, fortunately, I have in many cases in
the British Museum. Thus far I mean to adopt my notion, as never putting
mihi or "Darwin" after my own species, and in the anatomical text giving
no authors' names at all, as the systematic Part will serve for those
who want to know the History of a species as far as I can imperfectly
work it out...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [The Lodge, Malvern, March 28th, 1849.]

My dear Hooker,

Your letter of the 13th of October has remained unanswered till this
day! What an ungrateful return for a letter which interested me so much,
and which contained so much and curious information. But I have had a
bad winter.

On the 13th of November, my poor dear father died, and no one who did
not know him would believe that a man above eighty-three years old could
have retained so tender and affectionate a disposition, with all his
sagacity unclouded to the last. I was at the time so unwell, that I was
unable to travel, which added to my misery. Indeed, all this winter I
have been bad enough...and my nervous system began to be affected, so
that my hands trembled, and head was often swimming. I was not able to
do anything one day out of three, and was altogether too dispirited to
write to you, or to do anything but what I was compelled. I thought I
was rapidly going the way of all flesh. Having heard, accidentally, of
two persons who had received much benefit from the water-cure, I got Dr.
Gully's book, and made further enquiries, and at last started here,
with wife, children, and all our servants. We have taken a house for
two months, and have been here a fortnight. I am already a little
stronger...Dr. Gully feels pretty sure he can do me good, which most
certainly the regular doctors could not...I feel certain that the
water-cure is no quackery.

How I shall enjoy getting back to Down with renovated health, if such
is to be my good fortune, and resuming the beloved Barnacles. Now I hope
that you will forgive me for my negligence in not having sooner answered
your letter. I was uncommonly interested by the sketch you give of
your intended grand expedition, from which I suppose you will soon
be returning. How earnestly I hope that it may prove in every way
successful...

[When my father was at the Water-cure Establishment at Malvern he
was brought into contact with clairvoyance, of which he writes in the
following extract from a letter to Fox, September, 1850.

"You speak about Homoeopathy, which is a subject which makes me more
wrath, even than does Clairvoyance. Clairvoyance so transcends belief,
that one's ordinary faculties are put out of the question, but in
homoeopathy common sense and common observation come into play, and both
these must go to the dogs, if the infinitesimal doses have any effect
whatever. How true is a remark I saw the other day by Quetelet, in
respect to evidence of curative processes, viz., that no one knows in
disease what is the simple result of nothing being done, as a standard
with which to compare homoeopathy, and all other such things. It is a
sad flaw, I cannot but think, in my beloved Dr. Gully, that he believes
in everything. When Miss -- was very ill, he had a clairvoyant girl
to report on internal changes, a mesmerist to put her to sleep--an
homoeopathist, viz. Dr. --, and himself as hydropathist! and the girl
recovered."

A passage out of an earlier letter to Fox (December, 1884) shows that
he was equally sceptical on the subject of mesmerism: "With respect to
mesmerism, the whole country resounds with wonderful facts or tales..I
have just heard of a child, three or four years old (whose parents and
self I well knew) mesmerised by his father, which is the first fact
which has staggered me. I shall not believe fully till I see or hear
from good evidence of animals (as has been stated is possible) not
drugged, being put to stupor; of course the impossibility would not
prove mesmerism false; but it is the only clear experimentum crucis, and
I am astonished it has not been systematically tried. If mesmerism was
investigated, like a science, this could not have been left till the
present day to be DONE SATISFACTORILY, as it has been I believe left.
Keep some cats yourself, and do get some mesmeriser to attempt it. One
man told me he had succeeded, but his experiments were most vague, and
as was likely from a man who said cats were more easily done than other
animals, because they were so electrical!"]


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, December 4th [1849].

My dear Lyell,

This letter requires no answer, and I write from exuberance of vanity.
Dana has sent me the Geology of the United States Expedition, and I have
just read the Coral part. To begin with a modest speech, I AM ASTONISHED
AT MY OWN ACCURACY!! If I were to rewrite now my Coral book there is
hardly a sentence I should have to alter, except that I ought to have
attributed more effect to recent volcanic action in checking growth of
coral. When I say all this I ought to add that the CONSEQUENCES of the
theory on areas of subsidence are treated in a separate chapter to which
I have not come, and in this, I suspect, we shall differ more. Dana
talks of agreeing with my theory IN MOST POINTS; I can find out not one
in which he differs. Considering how infinitely more he saw of Coral
Reefs than I did, this is wonderfully satisfactory to me. He treats me
most courteously. There now, my vanity is pretty well satisfied...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Malvern, April 9th, 1849.

My dear Hooker,

The very next morning after posting my last letter (I think on 23rd
of March), I received your two interesting gossipaceous and geological
letters; and the latter I have since exchanged with Lyell for his. I
will write higglety-pigglety just as subjects occur. I saw the Review in
the 'Athenaeum,' it was written in an ill-natured spirit; but the whole
virus consisted in saying that there was not novelty enough in your
remarks for publication. No one, nowadays, cares for reviews. I may
just mention that my Journal got some REAL GOOD abuse, "presumption,"
etc.,--ended with saying that the volume appeared "made up of the scraps
and rubbish of the author's portfolio." I most truly enter into what
you say, and quite believe you that you care only for the review with
respect to your father; and that this ALONE would make you like to
see extracts from your letters more properly noticed in this same
periodical. I have considered to the very best of my judgment whether
any portion of your present letters are adapted for the 'Athenaeum' (in
which I have no interest; the beasts not having even NOTICED my three
geological volumes which I had sent to them), and I have come to the
conclusion it is better not to send them. I feel sure, considering all
the circumstances, that without you took pains and wrote WITH CARE, a
condensed and finished sketch of some striking feature in your travels,
it is better not to send anything. These two letters are, moreover,
rather too geological for the 'Athenaeum,' and almost require woodcuts.
On the other hand, there are hardly enough details for a communication
to the Geological Society. I have not the SMALLEST DOUBT that your
facts are of the highest interest with regard to glacial action in the
Himalaya; but it struck both Lyell and myself that your evidence ought
to have been given more distinctly...

I have written so lately that I have nothing to say about myself; my
health prevented me going on with a crusade against "mihi" and "nobis,"
of which you warn me of the dangers. I showed my paper to three or
four Naturalists, and they all agreed with me to a certain extent: with
health and vigour, I would not have shown a white feather, [and] with
aid of half-a-dozen really good Naturalists, I believe something might
have been done against the miserable and degrading passion of mere
species naming. In your letter you wonder what "Ornamental Poultry" has
to do with Barnacles; but do not flatter yourself that I shall not yet
live to finish the Barnacles, and then make a fool of myself on the
subject of species, under which head ornamental Poultry are very
interesting...


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. The Lodge, Malvern [June, 1849].

...I have got your book ('A Second Visit to the United States.'), and
have read all the first and a small part of the second volume (reading
is the hardest work allowed here), and greatly I have been interested by
it. It makes me long to be a Yankee. E. desires me to say that she
quite "gloated" over the truth of your remarks on religious progress...I
delight to think how you will disgust some of the bigots and educational
dons. As yet there has not been MUCH Geology or Natural History, for
which I hope you feel a little ashamed. Your remarks on all social
subjects strike me as worthy of the author of the 'Principles.' And yet
(I know it is prejudice and pride) if I had written the Principles, I
never would have written any travels; but I believe I am more jealous
about the honour and glory of the Principles than you are yourself...


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. September 14th, 1849.

...I go on with my aqueous processes, and very steadily but slowly gain
health and strength. Against all rules, I dined at Chevening with Lord
Mahon, who did me the great honour of calling on me, and how he heard of
me I can't guess. I was charmed with Lady Mahon, and any one might have
been proud at the pieces of agreeableness which came from her beautiful
lips with respect to you. I like old Lord Stanhope very much; though he
abused Geology and Zoology heartily. "To suppose that the Omnipotent
God made a world, found it a failure, and broke it up, and then made
it again, and again broke it up, as the Geologists say, is all fiddle
faddle. Describing Species of birds and shells, etc., is all fiddle
faddle..."

I am heartily glad we shall meet at Birmingham, as I trust we shall, if
my health will but keep up. I work now every day at the Cirripedia for
2 1/2 hours, and so get on a little, but very slowly. I sometimes,
after being a whole week employed and having described perhaps only
two species, agree mentally with Lord Stanhope, that it is all fiddle
faddle; however, the other day I got a curious case of a unisexual,
instead of hermaphrodite cirripede, in which the female had the common
cirripedial character, and in two valves of her shell had two little
pockets, in EACH of which she kept a little husband; I do not know of
any other case where a female invariably has two husbands. I have one
still odder fact, common to several species, namely, that though they
are hermaphrodite, they have small additional, or as I shall call them,
complemental males, one specimen itself hermaphrodite had no less than
SEVEN, of these complemental males attached to it. Truly the schemes and
wonders of Nature are illimitable. But I am running on as badly about my
cirripedia as about Geology; it makes me groan to think that probably
I shall never again have the exquisite pleasure of making out some new
district, of evolving geological light out of some troubled dark region.
So I must make the best of my Cirripedia...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 12th, 1849.

...By the way, one of the pleasantest parts of the British Association
was my journey down to Birmingham with Mrs. Sabine, Mrs. Reeve, and
the Colonel; also Col. Sykes and Porter. Mrs. Sabine and myself agreed
wonderfully on many points, and in none more sincerely than about you.
We spoke about your letters from the Erebus; and she quite agreed
with me, that you and the AUTHOR (Sir J. Hooker wrote the spirited
description of cattle hunting in Sir J. Ross's 'Voyage of Discovery in
the Southern Regions,' 1847, vol. ii., page 245.), of the description
of the cattle hunting in the Falklands, would have made a capital book
together! A very nice woman she is, and so is her sharp and sagacious
mother...Birmingham was very flat compared to Oxford, though I had my
wife with me. We saw a good deal of the Lyells and Horners and Robinsons
(the President); but the place was dismal, and I was prevented, by being
unwell, from going to Warwick, though that, i.e., the party, by all
accounts, was wonderfully inferior to Blenheim, not to say anything of
that heavenly day at Dropmore. One gets weary of all the spouting...

You ask about my cold-water cure; I am going on very well, and am
certainly a little better every month, my nights mend much slower than
my days. I have built a douche, and am to go on through all the winter,
frost or no frost. My treatment now is lamp five times per week, and
shallow bath for five minutes afterwards; douche daily for five minutes,
and dripping sheet daily. The treatment is wonderfully tonic, and I
have had more better consecutive days this month than on any previous
ones...I am allowed to work now two and a half hours daily, and I find
it as much as I can do, for the cold-water cure, together with three
short walks, is curiously exhausting; and I am actually FORCED to go to
bed at eight o'clock completely tired. I steadily gain in weight, and
eat immensely, and am never oppressed with my food. I have lost the
involuntary twitching of the muscle, and all the fainting feelings,
etc--black spots before eyes, etc. Dr. Gully thinks he shall quite cure
me in six or nine months more.

The greatest bore, which I find in the water-cure, is the having been
compelled to give up all reading, except the newspapers; for my daily
two and a half hours at the Barnacles is fully as much as I can do of
anything which occupies the mind; I am consequently terribly behind
in all scientific books. I have of late been at work at mere species
describing, which is much more difficult than I expected, and has much
the same sort of interest as a puzzle has; but I confess I often feel
wearied with the work, and cannot help sometimes asking myself what is
the good of spending a week or fortnight in ascertaining that certain
just perceptible differences blend together and constitute varieties
and not species. As long as I am on anatomy I never feel myself in that
disgusting, horrid, cui bono, inquiring, humour. What miserable work,
again, it is searching for priority of names. I have just finished two
species, which possess seven generic, and twenty-four specific names! My
chief comfort is, that the work must be sometime done, and I may as well
do it, as any one else.

I have given up my agitation against mihi and nobis; my paper is too
long to send to you, so you must see it, if you care to do so, on your
return. By-the-way, you say in your letter that you care more for my
species work than for the Barnacles; now this is too bad of you, for I
declare your decided approval of my plain Barnacle work over theoretic
species work, had very great influence in deciding me to go on with the
former, and defer my species paper...


[The following letter refers to the death of his little daughter, which
took place at Malvern on April 24, 1851:]


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, April 29th [1851].

My dear Fox,

I do not suppose you will have heard of our bitter and cruel loss. Poor
dear little Annie, when going on very well at Malvern, was taken with a
vomiting attack, which was at first thought of the smallest importance;
but it rapidly assumed the form of a low and dreadful fever, which
carried her off in ten days. Thank God, she suffered hardly at all, and
expired as tranquilly as a little angel. Our only consolation is that
she passed a short, though joyous life. She was my favourite child; her
cordiality, openness, buoyant joyousness and strong affections made her
most lovable. Poor dear little soul. Well it is all over...


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, March 7th [1852].

My dear Fox,

It is indeed an age since we have had any communication, and very glad
I was to receive your note. Our long silence occurred to me a few weeks
since, and I had then thought of writing, but was idle. I congratulate
and condole with you on your TENTH child; but please to observe when I
have a tenth, send only condolences to me. We have now seven children,
all well, thank God, as well as their mother; of these seven, five are
boys; and my father used to say that it was certain that a boy gave
as much trouble as three girls; so that bona fide we have seventeen
children. It makes me sick whenever I think of professions; all seem
hopelessly bad, and as yet I cannot see a ray of light. I should
very much like to talk over this (by the way, my three bugbears are
Californian and Australian gold, beggaring me by making my money on
mortgage worth nothing; the French coming by the Westerham and Sevenoaks
roads, and therefore enclosing Down; and thirdly, professions for my
boys), and I should like to talk about education, on which you ask me
what we are doing. No one can more truly despise the old stereotyped
stupid classical education than I do; but yet I have not had courage
to break through the trammels. After many doubts we have just sent our
eldest boy to Rugby, where for his age he has been very well placed...I
honour, admire, and envy you for educating your boys at home. What on
earth shall you do with your boys? Towards the end of this month we
go to see W. at Rugby, and thence for five or six days to Susan (His
sister.) at Shrewsbury; I then return home to look after the babies,
and E. goes to F. Wedgwood's of Etruria for a week. Very many thanks
for your most kind and large invitation to Delamere, but I fear we can
hardly compass it. I dread going anywhere, on account of my stomach so
easily failing under any excitement. I rarely even now go to London;
not that I am at all worse, perhaps rather better, and lead a very
comfortable life with my three hours of daily work, but it is the
life of a hermit. My nights are ALWAYS bad, and that stops my becoming
vigorous. You ask about water-cure. I take at intervals of two or three
months, five or six weeks of MODERATELY severe treatment, and always
with good effect. Do you come here, I pray and beg whenever you can find
time; you cannot tell how much pleasure it would give me and E. I have
finished the 1st volume for the Ray Society of Pedunculated Cirripedes,
which, as I think you are a member, you will soon get. Read what I
describe on the sexes of Ibla and Scalpellum. I am now at work on the
Sessile Cirripedes, and am wonderfully tired of my job: a man to be a
systematic naturalist ought to work at least eight hours per day. You
saw through me, when you said that I must have wished to have seen the
effects of the [word illegible] Debacle, for I was saying a week ago to
E., that had I been as I was in old days, I would have been certainly
off that hour. You ask after Erasmus; he is much as usual, and
constantly more or less unwell. Susan (His sister.) is much better, and
very flourishing and happy. Catherine (Another sister.) is at Rome,
and has enjoyed it in a degree that is quite astonishing to my dry old
bones. And now I think I have told you enough, and more than enough
about the house of Darwin; so my dear old friend, farewell. What
pleasant times we had in drinking coffee in your rooms at Christ's
College, and think of the glories of Crux major. (The beetle Panagaeus
crux-major.) Ah, in those days there were no professions for sons, no
ill-health to fear for them, no Californian gold, no French invasions.
How paramount the future is to the present when one is surrounded by
children. My dread is hereditary ill-health. Even death is better for
them.

My dear Fox, your sincere friend, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--Susan has lately been working in a way which I think truly heroic
about the scandalous violation of the Act against children climbing
chimneys. We have set up a little Society in Shrewsbury to prosecute
those who break the law. It is all Susan's doing. She has had very nice
letters from Lord Shaftesbury and the Duke of Sutherland, but the brutal
Shropshire squires are as hard as stones to move. The Act out of London
seems most commonly violated. It makes one shudder to fancy one of
one's own children at seven years old being forced up a chimney--to say
nothing of the consequent loathsome disease and ulcerated limbs, and
utter moral degradation. If you think strongly on this subject, do make
some inquiries; add to your many good works, this other one, and try
to stir up the magistrates. There are several people making a stir in
different parts of England on this subject. It is not very likely
that you would wish for such, but I could send you some essays and
information if you so liked, either for yourself or to give away.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down [October 24th, 1852].

My dear Fox,

I received your long and most welcome letter this morning, and will
answer it this evening, as I shall be very busy with an artist, drawing
Cirripedia, and much overworked for the next fortnight. But first you
deserve to be well abused--and pray consider yourself well abused--for
thinking or writing that I could for one minute be bored by any amount
of detail about yourself and belongings. It is just what I like hearing;
believe me that I often think of old days spent with you, and sometimes
can hardly believe what a jolly careless individual one was in those
old days. A bright autumn evening often brings to mind some shooting
excursion from Osmaston. I do indeed regret that we live so far off each
other, and that I am so little locomotive. I have been unusually well
of late (no water-cure), but I do not find that I can stand any change
better than formerly...The other day I went to London and back, and
the fatigue, though so trifling, brought on my bad form of vomiting. I
grieve to hear that your chest has been ailing, and most sincerely do
I hope that it is only the muscles; how frequently the voice fails with
the clergy. I can well understand your reluctance to break up your large
and happy party and go abroad; but your life is very valuable, so you
ought to be very cautious in good time. You ask about all of us, now
five boys (oh! the professions; oh! the gold; and oh! the French--these
three oh's all rank as dreadful bugbears) and two girls...but another
and the worst of my bugbears is hereditary weakness. All my sisters are
well except Mrs. Parker, who is much out of health; and so is Erasmus
at his poor average: he has lately moved into Queen Anne Street. I had
heard of the intended marriage (To the Rev. J. Hughes.) of your sister
Frances. I believe I have seen her since, but my memory takes me back
some twenty-five years, when she was lying down. I remember well the
delightful expression of her countenance. I most sincerely wish her all
happiness.

I see I have not answered half your queries. We like very well all that
we have seen and heard of Rugby, and have never repented of sending [W.]
there. I feel sure schools have greatly improved since our days; but I
hate schools and the whole system of breaking through the affections of
the family by separating the boys so early in life; but I see no help,
and dare not run the risk of a youth being exposed to the temptations of
the world without having undergone the milder ordeal of a great school.

I see you even ask after our pears. We have lots of Beurrees d'Aremberg,
Winter Nelis, Marie Louise, and "Ne plus Ultra," but all off the wall;
the standard dwarfs have borne a few, but I have no room for more trees,
so their names would be useless to me. You really must make a holiday
and pay us a visit sometime; nowhere could you be more heartily welcome.
I am at work at the second volume of the Cirripedia, of which creatures
I am wonderfully tired. I hate a Barnacle as no man ever did before, not
even a sailor in a slow-sailing ship. My first volume is out; the only
part worth looking at is on the sexes of Ibla and Scalpellum. I hope
by next summer to have done with my tedious work. Farewell,--do come
whenever you can possibly manage it.

I cannot but hope that the carbuncle may possibly do you good: I have
heard of all sorts of weaknesses disappearing after a carbuncle. I
suppose the pain is dreadful. I agree most entirely, what a blessed
discovery is chloroform. When one thinks of one's children, it makes
quite a little difference in one's happiness. The other day I had five
grinders (two by the elevator) out at a sitting under this wonderful
substance, and felt hardly anything.

My dear old friend, yours very affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, January 29th [1853].

My dear Fox,

Your last account some months ago was so little satisfactory that I have
often been thinking of you, and should be really obliged if you would
give me a few lines, and tell me how your voice and chest are. I most
sincerely hope that your report will be good...Our second lad has a
strong mechanical turn, and we think of making him an engineer. I shall
try and find out for him some less classical school, perhaps Bruce
Castle. I certainly should like to see more diversity in education
than there is in any ordinary school--no exercising of the observing or
reasoning faculties, no general knowledge acquired--I must think it a
wretched system. On the other hand, a boy who has learnt to stick at
Latin and conquer its difficulties, ought to be able to stick at any
labour. I should always be glad to hear anything about schools or
education from you. I am at my old, never-ending subject, but trust
I shall really go to press in a few months with my second volume on
Cirripedes. I have been much pleased by finding some odd facts in my
first volume believed by Owen and a few others, whose good opinion I
regard as final...Do write pretty soon, and tell me all you can about
yourself and family; and I trust your report of yourself may be much
better than your last.

...I have been very little in London of late, and have not seen Lyell
since his return from America; how lucky he was to exhume with his
own hand parts of three skeletons of reptiles out of the CARBONIFEROUS
strata, and out of the inside of a fossil tree, which had been hollow
within.

Farewell, my dear Fox, yours affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. 13 Sea Houses, Eastbourne, [July 15th?
1853].

My dear Fox,

Here we are in a state of profound idleness, which to me is a luxury;
and we should all, I believe, have been in a state of high enjoyment,
had it not been for the detestable cold gales and much rain, which
always gives much ennui to children away from their homes. I received
your letter of 13th June, when working like a slave with Mr. Sowerby at
drawing for my second volume, and so put off answering it till when I
knew I should be at leisure. I was extremely glad to get your letter. I
had intended a couple of months ago sending you a savage or supplicating
jobation to know how you were, when I met Sir P. Egerton, who told me
you were well, and, as usual, expressed his admiration of your doings,
especially your farming, and the number of animals, including children,
which you kept on your land. Eleven children, ave Maria! it is a serious
look-out for you. Indeed, I look at my five boys as something awful, and
hate the very thoughts of professions, etc. If one could insure moderate
health for them it would not signify so much, for I cannot but hope,
with the enormous emigration, professions will somewhat improve. But my
bugbear is hereditary weakness. I particularly like to hear all that you
can say about education, and you deserve to be scolded for saying "you
did not mean to TORMENT me with a long yarn." You ask about Rugby.
I like it very well, on the same principle as my neighbour, Sir J.
Lubbock, likes Eton, viz., that it is not worse than any other school;
the expense, WITH ALL ETC., ETC., including some clothes, travelling
expenses, etc., is from 110 pounds to 120 pounds per annum. I do not
think schools are so wicked as they were, and far more industrious. The
boys, I think, live too secluded in their separate studies; and I doubt
whether they will get so much knowledge of character as boys used to do;
and this, in my opinion, is the ONE good of public schools over small
schools. I should think the only superiority of a small school over home
was forced regularity in their work, which your boys perhaps get at
your home, but which I do not believe my boys would get at my home.
Otherwise, it is quite lamentable sending boys so early in life from
their home.

...To return to schools. My main objection to them, as places of
education, is the enormous proportion of time spent over classics. I
fancy (though perhaps it is only fancy) that I can perceive the ill
and contracting effect on my eldest boy's mind, in checking interest in
anything in which reasoning and observation come into play. Mere memory
seems to be worked. I shall certainly look out for some school with more
diversified studies for my younger boys. I was talking lately to the
Dean of Hereford, who takes most strongly this view; and he tells me
that there is a school at Hereford commencing on this plan; and that
Dr. Kennedy at Shrewsbury is going to begin vigorously to modify that
school...

I am EXTREMELY glad to hear that you approved of my cirripedial volume.
I have spent an almost ridiculous amount of labour on the subject, and
certainly would never have undertaken it had I foreseen what a job it
was. I hope to have finished by the end of the year. Do write again
before a very long time; it is a real pleasure to me to hear from you.
Farewell, with my wife's kindest remembrances to yourself and Mrs. Fox.

My dear old friend, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, August 10th [1853].

My dear Fox,

I thank you sincerely for writing to me so soon after your most
heavy misfortune. Your letter affected me so much. We both most truly
sympathise with you and Mrs. Fox. We too lost, as you may remember, not
so very long ago, a most dear child, of whom I can hardly yet bear
to think tranquilly; yet, as you must know from your own most painful
experience, time softens and deadens, in a manner truly wonderful, one's
feelings and regrets. At first it is indeed bitter. I can only hope that
your health and that of poor Mrs. Fox may be preserved, and that time
may do its work softly, and bring you all together, once again, as the
happy family, which, as I can well believe, you so lately formed.

My dear Fox, your affectionate friend, CHARLES DARWIN.


[The following letter refers to the Royal Society's Medal, which was
awarded to him in November, 1853:]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 5th [1853].

My dear Hooker,

Amongst my letters received this morning, I opened first one from
Colonel Sabine; the contents certainly surprised me very much, but,
though the letter was a VERY KIND ONE, somehow, I cared very little
indeed for the announcement it contained. I then opened yours, and
such is the effect of warmth, friendship, and kindness from one that is
loved, that the very same fact, told as you told it, made me glow with
pleasure till my very heart throbbed. Believe me, I shall not soon
forget the pleasure of your letter. Such hearty, affectionate sympathy
is worth more than all the medals that ever were or will be coined.
Again, my dear Hooker, I thank you. I hope Lindley (John Lindley,
1799-1865, was the son of a nurseryman near Norwich, through whose
failure in business he was thrown at the age of twenty on his own
resources. He was befriended by Sir W. Hooker, and employed as assistant
librarian by Sir J. Banks. He seems to have had enormous capacity of
work, and is said to have translated Richard's 'Analyse du Fruit' at one
sitting of two days and three nights. He became Assistant-Secretary to
the Horticultural Society, and in 1829 was appointed Professor of Botany
at University College, a post which he held for upwards of thirty years.
His writings are numerous: the best known being perhaps his 'Vegetable
Kingdom,' published in 1846. His influence in helping to introduce the
natural system of classification was considerable, and he brought "all
the weight of his teaching and all the force of his controversial powers
to support it," as against the Linnean system universally taught in the
earlier part of his career. Sachs points out (Geschichte der Botanik,
1875, page 161), that though Lindley adopted in the main a sound
classification of plants, he only did so by abandoning his own
theoretical principle that the physiological importance of an organ is
a measure of its classificatory value.) will never hear that he was a
competitor against me; for really it is almost RIDICULOUS (of course you
would never repeat that I said this, for it would be thought by others,
though not, I believe, by you, to be affectation) his not having the
medal long before me; I must feel SURE that you did quite right to
propose him; and what a good, dear, kind fellow you are, nevertheless,
to rejoice in this honour being bestowed on me.

What PLEASURE I have felt on the occasion, I owe almost entirely to you.

Farewell, my dear Hooker, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--You may believe what a surprise it was, for I had never heard that
the medals could be given except for papers in the 'Transactions.' All
this will make me work with better heart at finishing the second volume.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, February 18th [1854].

My dear Lyell,

I should have written before, had it not seemed doubtful whether you
would go on to Teneriffe, but now I am extremely glad to hear your
further progress is certain; not that I have much of any sort to say, as
you may well believe when you hear that I have only once been in London
since you started. I was particularly glad to see, two days since, your
letter to Mr. Horner, with its geological news; how fortunate for you
that your knees are recovered. I am astonished at what you say of the
beauty, though I had fancied it great. It really makes me quite envious
to think of your clambering up and down those steep valleys. And what
a pleasant party on your return from your expeditions. I often think
of the delight which I felt when examining volcanic islands, and I can
remember even particular rocks which I struck, and the smell of the hot,
black, scoriaceous cliffs; but of those HOT smells you do not seem to
have had much. I do quite envy you. How I should like to be with you,
and speculate on the deep and narrow valleys.

How very singular the fact is which you mention about the inclination of
the strata being greater round the circumference than in the middle
of the island; do you suppose the elevation has had the form of a flat
dome? I remember in the Cordillera being OFTEN struck with the greater
abruptness of the strata in the LOW EXTREME outermost ranges, compared
with the great mass of inner mountains. I dare say you will have thought
of measuring exactly the width of any dikes at the top and bottom of any
great cliff (which was done by Mr. Searle [?] at St. Helena), for it
has often struck me as VERY ODD that the cracks did not die out OFTENER
upwards. I can think of hardly any news to tell you, as I have seen no
one since being in London, when I was delighted to see Forbes looking so
well, quite big and burly. I saw at the Museum some of the surprisingly
rich gold ore from North Wales. Ramsay also told me that he has lately
turned a good deal of New Red Sandstone into Permian, together with the
Labyrinthodon. No doubt you see newspapers, and know that E. de Beaumont
is perpetual Secretary, and will, I suppose, be more powerful than ever;
and Le Verrier has Arago's place in the Observatory. There was a meeting
lately at the Geological Society, at which Prestwich (judging from what
R. Jones told me) brought forward your exact theory, viz. that the whole
red clay and flints over the chalk plateau hereabouts is the residuum
from the slow dissolution of the chalk!

As regards ourselves, we have no news, and are all well. The Hookers,
sometime ago, stayed a fortnight with us, and, to our extreme delight,
Henslow came down, and was most quiet and comfortable here. It does one
good to see so composed, benevolent, and intellectual a countenance.
There have been great fears that his heart is affected; but, I hope
to God, without foundation. Hooker's book (Sir J. Hooker's 'Himalayan
Journal.') is out, and MOST BEAUTIFULLY got up. He has honoured me
beyond measure by dedicating it to me! As for myself, I am got to the
page 112 of the Barnacles, and that is the sum total of my history.
By-the-way, as you care so much about North America, I may mention that
I had a long letter from a shipmate in Australia, who says the Colony is
getting decidedly republican from the influx of Americans, and that
all the great and novel schemes for working the gold are planned and
executed by these men. What a go-a-head nation it is! Give my kindest
remembrances to Lady Lyell, and to Mrs. Bunbury, and to Bunbury. I
most heartily wish that the Canaries may be ten times as interesting as
Madeira, and that everything may go on most prosperously with your whole
party.

My dear Lyell, Yours most truly and affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 1st [1854].

My dear Hooker,

I finished yesterday evening the first volume, and I very sincerely
congratulate you on having produced a FIRST-CLASS book ('Himalayan
Journal.')--a book which certainly will last. I cannot doubt that it
will take its place as a standard, not so much because it contains real
solid matter, but that it gives a picture of the whole country. One can
feel that one has seen it (and desperately uncomfortable I felt in going
over some of the bridges and steep slopes), and one REALISES all the
great Physical features. You have in truth reason to be proud; consider
how few travellers there have been with a profound knowledge of one
subject, and who could in addition make a map (which, by-the-way, is one
of the most distinct ones I ever looked at, wherefore blessings alight
on your head), and study geology and meteorology! I thought I knew you
very well, but I had not the least idea that your Travels were your
hobby; but I am heartily glad of it, for I feel sure that the time will
never come when you and Mrs. Hooker will not be proud to look back at
the labour bestowed on these beautiful volumes.

Your letter, received this morning, has interested me EXTREMELY, and I
thank you sincerely for telling me your old thoughts and aspirations.
All that you say makes me even more deeply gratified by the Dedication;
but you, bad man, do you remember asking me how I thought Lyell
would like the work to be dedicated to him? I remember how strongly I
answered, and I presume you wanted to know what I should feel; whoever
would have dreamed of your being so crafty? I am glad you have shown a
little bit of ambition about your Journal, for you must know that I have
often abused you for not caring more about fame, though, at the same
time, I must confess, I have envied and honoured you for being so free
(too free, as I have always thought) of this "last infirmity of, etc."
Do not say, "there never was a past hitherto to me--the phantom was
always in view," for you will soon find other phantoms in view. How well
I know this feeling, and did formerly still more vividly; but I think
my stomach has much deadened my former pure enthusiasm for science and
knowledge.

I am writing an unconscionably long letter, but I must return to the
Journals, about which I have hardly said anything in detail. Imprimis,
the illustrations and maps appear to me the best I have ever seen; the
style seems to me everywhere perfectly clear (how rare a virtue), and
some passages really eloquent. How excellently you have described the
upper valleys, and how detestable their climate; I felt quite anxious on
the slopes of Kinchin that dreadful snowy night. Nothing has astonished
me more than your physical strength; and all those devilish bridges!
Well, thank goodness! It is not VERY likely that I shall ever go to
the Himalaya. Much in a scientific point of view has interested me,
especially all about those wonderful moraines. I certainly think I quite
realise the valleys, more vividly perhaps from having seen the valleys
of Tahiti. I cannot doubt that the Himalaya owe almost all their contour
to running water, and that they have been subjected to such action
longer than any mountains (as yet described) in the world. What a
contrast with the Andes!

Perhaps you would like to hear the very little that I can say per
contra, and this only applied to the beginning, in which (as it struck
me) there was not FLOW enough till you get to Mirzapore on the Ganges
(but the Thugs were MOST interesting), where the stream seemed to
carry you on more equably with longer sentences and longer facts and
discussions, etc. In another edition (and I am delighted to hear that
Murray has sold all off), I would consider whether this part could not
be condensed. Even if the meteorology was put in foot-notes, I think it
would be an improvement. All the world is against me, but it makes me
very unhappy to see the Latin names all in Italics, and all mingled with
English names in Roman type; but I must bear this burden, for all men of
Science seem to think it would corrupt the Latin to dress it up in the
same type as poor old English. Well, I am very proud of MY book; but
there is one bore, that I do not much like asking people whether they
have seen it, and how they like it, for I feel so much identified with
it, that such questions become rather personal. Hence, I cannot tell you
the opinion of others. You will have seen a fairly good review in the
'Athenaeum.'

What capital news from Tasmania: it really is a very remarkable and
creditable fact to the Colony. (This refers to an unsolicited grant by
the Colonial Government towards the expenses of Sir J. Hooker's 'Flora
of Tasmania.') I am always building veritable castles in the air about
emigrating, and Tasmania has been my head-quarters of late; so that I
feel very proud of my adopted country: is really a very singular and
delightful fact, contrasted with the slight appreciation of science in
the old country. I thank you heartily for your letter this morning, and
for all the gratification your Dedication has given me; I could not help
thinking how much -- would despise you for not having dedicated it to
some great man, who would have done you and it some good in the eyes
of the world. Ah, my dear Hooker, you were very soft on this head, and
justify what I say about not caring enough for your own fame. I wish
I was in every way more worthy of your good opinion. Farewell.
How pleasantly Mrs. Hooker and you must rest from one of your many
labours...

Again farewell: I have written a wonderfully long letter. Adios, and God
bless you.

My dear Hooker, ever yours, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--I have just looked over my rambling letter; I see that I have not
at all expressed my strong admiration at the amount of scientific work,
in so many branches, which you have effected. It is really grand. You
have a right to rest on your oars; or even to say, if it so pleases you,
that "your meridian is past;" but well assured do I feel that the day of
your reputation and general recognition has only just begun to dawn.


[In September, 1854, his Cirripede work was practically finished, and he
wrote to Dr. Hooker:

"I have been frittering away my time for the last several weeks in a
wearisome manner, partly idleness, and odds and ends, and sending ten
thousand Barnacles out of the house all over the world. But I shall now
in a day or two begin to look over my old notes on species. What a deal
I shall have to discuss with you; I shall have to look sharp that I do
not 'progress' into one of the greatest bores in life, to the few like
you with lots of knowledge."]




CHAPTER 1.X. -- THE GROWTH OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'

[The growth of the 'Origin of Species' has been briefly described in my
father's words (above). The letters given in the present and following
chapters will illustrate and amplify the history thus sketched out.]

It is clear that in the early part of the voyage of the "Beagle" he did
not feel it inconsistent with his views to express himself in thoroughly
orthodox language as to the genesis of new species. Thus in 1834 he
wrote (MS. Journals, page 468.) at Valparaiso: "I have already found
beds of recent shells yet retaining their colour at an elevation of 1300
feet, and beneath, the level country is strewn with them. It seems not a
very improbable conjecture that the want of animals may be owing to none
having been created since this country was raised from the sea."

This passage does not occur in the published 'Journal,' the last proof
of which was finished in 1837; and this fact harmonizes with the change
we know to have been proceeding in his views. But in the published
'Journal' we find passages which show a point of view more in accordance
with orthodox theological natural history than with his later views.
Thus, in speaking of the birds Synallaxis and Scytalopus (1st edition
page 353; 2nd edition page 289), he says: "When finding, as in this
case, any animal which seems to play so insignificant a part in the
great scheme of nature, one is apt to wonder why a distinct species
should have been created."

A comparison of the two editions of the 'Journal' is instructive, as
giving some idea of the development of his views on evolution. It does
not give us a true index of the mass of conjecture which was taking
shape in his mind, but it shows us that he felt sure enough of the truth
of his belief to allow a stronger tinge of evolution to appear in the
second edition. He has mentioned in the Autobiography that it was not
until he read Malthus that he got a clear view of the potency of natural
selection. This was in 1838--a year after he finished the first edition
(it was not published until 1839), and five years before the second
edition was written (1845). Thus the turning-point in the formation of
his theory took place between the writing of the two editions.

I will first give a few passages which are practically the same in
the two editions, and which are, therefore, chiefly of interest as
illustrating his frame of mind in 1837.

The case of the two species of Molothrus (1st edition page 61; 2nd
edition page 53) must have been one of the earliest instances noticed
by him of the existence of representative species--a phenomenon which we
know ('Autobiography,') struck him deeply. The discussion on introduced
animals (1st edition page 139; 2nd edition page 120) shows how much he
was impressed by the complicated interdependence of the inhabitants of a
given area.

An analogous point of view is given in the discussion (1st edition
page 98; 2nd edition page 85) of the mistaken belief that large animals
require, for their support, a luxuriant vegetation; the incorrectness of
this view is illustrated by the comparison of the fauna of South
Africa and South America, and the vegetation of the two continents.
The interest of the discussion is that it shows clearly our a priori
ignorance of the conditions of life suitable to any organism.

There is a passage which has been more than once quoted as bearing
on the origin of his views. It is where he discusses the striking
difference between the species of mice on the east and west of the Andes
(1st edition page 399): "Unless we suppose the same species to have been
created in two different countries, we ought not to expect any closer
similarity between the organic beings on the opposite sides of the
Andes than on shores separated by a broad strait of the sea." In the
2nd edition page 327, the passage is almost verbally identical, and is
practically the same.

There are other passages again which are more strongly evolutionary in
the 2nd edition, but otherwise are similar to the corresponding passages
in the 1st edition. Thus, in describing the blind Tuco-tuco (1st edition
page 60; 2nd edition page 52), in the first edition he makes no allusion
to what Lamarck might have thought, nor is the instance used as an
example of modification, as in the edition of 1845.

A striking passage occurs in the 2nd edition (page 173) on the
relationship between the "extinct edentata and the living sloths,
ant-eaters, and armadillos."

"This wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead
and the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw more light on the
appearance of organic beings on our earth, and their disappearance from
it, than any other class of facts."

This sentence does not occur in the 1st edition, but he was evidently
profoundly struck by the disappearance of the gigantic forerunners of
the present animals. The difference between the discussions in the two
editions is most instructive. In both, our ignorance of the conditions
of life is insisted on, but in the second edition, the discussion is
made to led up to a strong statement of the intensity of the struggle
for life. Then follows a comparison between rarity (In the second
edition, page 146, the destruction of Niata cattle by droughts is
given as a good example of our ignorance of the causes of rarity or
extinction. The passage does not occur in the first edition.) and
extinction, which introduces the idea that the preservation and
dominance of existing species depend on the degree in which they are
adapted to surrounding conditions. In the first edition, he is merely
"tempted to believe in such simple relations as variation of climate
and food, or introduction of enemies, or the increased number of other
species, as the cause of the succession of races." But finally (1st
edition) he ends the chapter by comparing the extinction of a species to
the exhaustion and disappearance of varieties of fruit-trees: as if he
thought that a mysterious term of life was impressed on each species at
its creation.

The difference of treatment of the Galapagos problem is of some
interest. In the earlier book, the American type of the productions
of the islands is noticed, as is the fact that the different islands
possess forms specially their own, but the importance of the whole
problem is not so strongly put forward. Thus, in the first edition, he
merely says:--

"This similarity of type between distant islands and continents, while
the species are distinct, has scarcely been sufficiently noticed. The
circumstance would be explained, according to the views of some authors,
by saying that the creative power had acted according to the same law
over a wide area."--(1st edition page 474.)

This passage is not given in the second edition, and the generalisations
on geographical distribution are much wider and fuller. Thus he asks:--

"Why were their aboriginal inhabitants, associated...in different
proportions both in kind and number from those on the Continent, and
therefore acting on each other in a different manner--why were they
created on American types of organisation?"--(2nd edition page 393.)

The same difference of treatment is shown elsewhere in this chapter.
Thus the gradation in the form of beak presented by the thirteen allied
species of finch is described in the first edition (page 461) without
comment. Whereas in the second edition (page 380) he concludes:--

"One might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this
Archipelago, one species has been taken and modified for different
ends."

On the whole it seems to me remarkable that the difference between the
two editions is not greater; it is another proof of the author's caution
and self-restraint in the treatment of his theory. After reading the
second edition of the 'Journal,' we find with a strong sense of surprise
how far developed were his views in 1837. We are enabled to form
an opinion on this point from the note-books in which he wrote down
detached thoughts and queries. I shall quote from the first note-book,
completed between July 1837 and February 1838: and this is the more
worth doing, as it gives us an insight into the condition of his
thoughts before the reading of Malthus. The notes are written in his
most hurried style, so many words being omitted, that it is often
difficult to arrive at the meaning. With a few exceptions (indicated by
square brackets) (In the extracts from the note-book ordinary brackets
represent my father's parentheses.) I have printed the extracts as
written; the punctuation, however, has been altered, and a few obvious
slips corrected where it seemed necessary. The extracts are not
printed in order, but are roughly classified. (On the first page of the
note-book, is written "Zoonomia"; this seems to refer to the first few
pages in which reproduction by gemmation is discussed, and where the
"Zoonomia" is mentioned. Many pages have been cut out of the note-book,
probably for use in writing the Sketch of 1844, and these would have no
doubt contained the most interesting extracts.)

"Propagation explains why modern animals same type as extinct, which is
law, almost proved."

"We can see why structure is common in certain countries when we can
hardly believe necessary, but if it was necessary to one forefather,
the result would be as it is. Hence antelopes at Cape of Good Hope;
marsupials at Australia."

"Countries longest separated greatest differences--if separated
from immersage, possibly two distinct types, but each having its
representatives--as in Australia."

"Will this apply to whole organic kingdom when our planet first cooled?"

The two following extracts show that he applied the theory of evolution
to the "whole organic kingdom" from plants to man.

"If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow
brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine--our slaves in
the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements--they may
partake [of?] our origin in one common ancestor--we may be all melted
together."

"The different intellects of man and animals not so great as between
living things without thought (plants), and living things with thought
(animals)."

The following extracts are again concerned with an a priori view of
the probability of the origin of species by descent ["propagation," he
called it.].

"The tree of life should perhaps be called the coral of life, base of
branches dead; so that passages cannot be seen."

"There never may have been grade between pig and tapir, yet from some
common progenitor. Now if the intermediate ranks had produced infinite
species, probably the series would have been more perfect."

At another place, speaking of intermediate forms he says:--

"Cuvier objects to propagation of species by saying, why have not some
intermediate forms been discovered between Palaeotherium, Megalonyx,
Mastodon, and the species now living? Now according to my view (in
S. America) parent of all Armadilloes might be brother to
Megatherium--uncle now dead."

Speaking elsewhere of intermediate forms, he remarks:--

"Opponents will say--'show them me.' I will answer yes, if you will show
me every step between bulldog and greyhound."

Here we see that the case of domestic animals was already present in his
mind as bearing on the production of natural species. The disappearance
of intermediate forms naturally leads up to the subject of extinction,
with which the next extract begins.

"It is a wonderful fact, horse, elephant, and mastodon, dying out about
same time in such different quarters.

"Will Mr. Lyell say that some [same?] circumstance killed it over a
tract from Spain to South America?--(Never).

"They die, without they change, like golden pippins; it is a GENERATION
OF SPECIES like generation OF INDIVIDUALS.

"Why does individual die? To perpetuate certain peculiarities (therefore
adaptation), and obliterate accidental varieties, and to accommodate
itself to change (for, of course, change, even in varieties, is
accommodation). Now this argument applies to species.

"If individual cannot propagate he has no issue--so with species.

"If SPECIES generate other SPECIES, their race is not utterly cut off:--
like golden pippins, if produced by seed, go on--otherwise all die.

"The fossil horse generated, in South Africa, zebra--and
continued--perished in America.

"All animals of same species are bound together just like buds of
plants, which die at one time, though produced either sooner or later.
Prove animals like plants--trace gradation between associated and
non-associated animals--and the story will be complete."

Here we have the view already alluded to of a term of life impressed on
a species.

But in the following note we get extinction connected with unfavourable
variation, and thus a hint is given of natural selection:

"With respect to extinction, we can easily see that [a] variety of [the]
ostrich (Petise), may not be well adapted, and thus perish out; or, on
the other hand, like Orpheus [a Galapagos bird], being favourable, many
might be produced. This requires [the] principle that the permanent
variations produced by confined breeding and changing circumstances are
continued and produced according to the adaptation of such circumstance,
and therefore that death of species is a consequence (contrary to what
would appear from America) of non-adaptation of circumstances."

The first part of the next extract has a similar bearing. The end of the
passage is of much interest, as showing that he had at this early date
visions of the far-reaching character of the theory of evolution:--

"With belief of transmutation and geographical grouping, we are lead to
endeavour to discover CAUSES of change; the manner of adaptation (wish
of parents??), instinct and structure becomes full of speculation and
lines of observation. View of generation being condensation (I imagine
him to mean that each generation is "condensed" to a small number of
the best organized individuals.) test of highest organisation
intelligible...My theory would give zest to recent and fossil
comparative anatomy; it would lead to the study of instincts, heredity,
and mind-heredity, whole [of] metaphysics.

"It would lead to closest examination of hybridity and generation,
causes of change in order to know what we have come from and to what we
tend--to what circumstances favour crossing and what prevents it--this,
and direct examination of direct passages of structure in species, might
lead to laws of change, which would then be [the] main object of study,
to guide our speculations."

The following two extracts have a similar interest; the second is
especially interesting, as it contains the germ of concluding sentence
of the 'Origin of Species': ('Origin of Species' (1st edition), page
490:-- "There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several
powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one;
and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed
law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful
and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.")--

"Before the attraction of gravity discovered it might have been said it
was as great a difficulty to account for the movement of all [planets]
by one law, as to account for each separate one; so to say that all
mammalia were born from one stock, and since distributed by such means
as we can recognise, may be thought to explain nothing.

"Astronomers might formerly have said that God fore-ordered each planet
to move in its particular destiny. In the same manner God orders each
animal created with certain forms in certain countries, but how much
more simple and sublime [a] power--let attraction act according to
certain law, such are inevitable consequences--let animals be created,
then by the fixed laws of generation, such will be their successors.

"Let the powers of transportal be such, and so will be the forms of one
country to another--let geological changes go at such a rate, so will be
the number and distribution of the species!!"

The three next extracts are of miscellaneous interest:--

"When one sees nipple on man's breast, one does not say some use, but
sex not having been determined--so with useless wings under elytra of
beetles--born from beetles with wings, and modified--if simple creation
merely, would have been born without them."

"In a decreasing population at any one moment fewer closely related
(few species of genera); ultimately few genera (for otherwise the
relationship would converge sooner), and lastly, perhaps, some one
single one. Will not this account for the odd genera with few species
which stand between great groups, which we are bound to consider the
increasing ones?"

The last extract which I shall quote gives the germ of his theory of
the relation between alpine plants in various parts of the world, in the
publication of which he was forestalled by E. Forbes (see volume i.
page 72). He says, in the 1837 note-book, that alpine plants, "formerly
descended lower, therefore [they are] species of lower genera altered,
or northern plants."

When we turn to the Sketch of his theory, written in 1844 (still
therefore before the second edition of the 'Journal' was completed), we
find an enormous advance made on the note-book of 1837. The Sketch is
an fact a surprisingly complete presentation of the argument afterwards
familiar to us in the 'Origin of Species.' There is some obscurity as to
the date of the short Sketch which formed the basis of the 1844 Essay.
We know from his own words (volume i., page 68), that it was in June
1842 that he first wrote out a short sketch of his views. (This version
I cannot find, and it was probably destroyed, like so much of his MS.,
after it had been enlarged and re-copied in 1844.) This statement is
given with so much circumstance that it is almost impossible to suppose
that it contains an error of date. It agrees also with the following
extract from his Diary.

1842. May 18th. Went to Maer.

"June 15th to Shrewsbury, and on 18th to Capel Curig. During my stay at
Maer and Shrewsbury (five years after commencement) wrote pencil-sketch
of species theory."

Again in the introduction to the 'Origin,' page 1, he writes, "after
an interval of five years' work" [from 1837, i.e. in 1842], "I allowed
myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes."

Nevertheless in the letter signed by Sir C. Lyell and Sir J.D. Hooker,
which serves as an introduction to the joint paper of Messrs. C. Darwin
and A. Wallace on the 'Tendency of Species to form Varieties,' ('Linn.
Soc. Journal,' 1858, page 45.) the essay of 1844 (extracts from which
form part of the paper) is said to have been "sketched in 1839, and
copied in 1844." This statement is obviously made on the authority of
a note written in my father's hand across the Table of Contents of the
1844 Essay. It is to the following effect: "This was sketched in 1839,
and copied out in full, as here written and read by you in 1844." I
conclude that this note was added in 1858, when the MS. was sent to Sir
J.D. Hooker (see Letter of June 29, 1858, page 476). There is also some
further evidence on this side of the question. Writing to Mr. Wallace
(January 25, 1859) my father says:-- "Every one whom I have seen
has thought your paper very well written and interesting. It puts my
extracts (written in 1839, now just twenty years ago!), which I must say
in apology were never for an instant intended for publication; into the
shade." The statement that the earliest sketch was written in 1839 has
been frequently made in biographical notices of my father, no doubt
on the authority of the 'Linnean Journal,' but it must, I think, be
considered as erroneous. The error may possibly have arisen in this way.
In writing on the Table of Contents of the 1844 MS. that it was sketched
in 1839, I think my father may have intended to imply that the framework
of the theory was clearly thought out by him at that date. In the
Autobiography he speaks of the time, "about 1839, when the theory was
clearly conceived," meaning, no doubt, the end of 1838 and beginning of
1839, when the reading of Malthus had given him the key to the idea of
natural selection. But this explanation does not apply to the letter to
Mr. Wallace; and with regard to the passage (My father certainly saw the
proofs of the paper, for he added a foot-note apologising for the style
of the extracts, on the ground that the "work was never intended for
publication.") in the 'Linnean Journal' it is difficult to understand
how it should have been allowed to remain as it now stands, conveying,
as it clearly does, the impression that 1839 was the date of his
earliest written sketch.

The sketch of 1844 is written in a clerk's hand, in two hundred and
thirty-one pages folio, blank leaves being alternated with the MS.
with a view to amplification. The text has been revised and corrected,
criticisms being pencilled by himself on the margin. It is divided into
two parts: I. "On the variation of Organic Beings under Domestication
and in their Natural State." II. "On the Evidence favourable and opposed
to the view that Species are naturally formed races descended from
common Stocks." The first part contains the main argument of the 'Origin
of Species.' It is founded, as is the argument of that work, on the
study of domestic animals, and both the Sketch and the 'Origin' open
with a chapter on variation under domestication and on artificial
selection. This is followed, in both essays, by discussions on variation
under nature, on natural selection, and on the struggle for life. Here,
any close resemblance between the two essays with regard to arrangement
ceases. Chapter III. of the Sketch, which concludes the first part,
treats of the variations which occur in the instincts and habits of
animals, and thus corresponds to some extent with Chapter VII. of the
'Origin' (1st edition). It thus forms a complement to the chapters which
deal with variation in structure. It seems to have been placed thus
early in the Essay to prevent the hasty rejection of the whole theory by
a reader to whom the idea of natural selection acting on instincts might
seem impossible. This is the more probable, as the Chapter on Instinct
in the 'Origin' is specially mentioned (Introduction, page 5) as one of
the "most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory." Moreover the
chapter in the Sketch ends with a discussion, "whether any particular
corporeal structures...are so wonderful as to justify the rejection
prima facie of our theory." Under this heading comes the discussion
of the eye, which in the 'Origin' finds its place in Chapter VI. under
"Difficulties of the Theory." The second part seems to have been planned
in accordance with his favourite point of view with regard to his
theory. This is briefly given in a letter to Dr. Asa Gray, November
11th, 1859: "I cannot possibly believe that a false theory would explain
so many classes of facts, as I think it certainly does explain. On these
grounds I drop my anchor, and believe that the difficulties will slowly
disappear." On this principle, having stated the theory in the first
part, he proceeds to show to what extent various wide series of facts
can be explained by its means.

Thus the second part of the Sketch corresponds roughly to the nine
concluding Chapters of the First Edition of the 'Origin.' But we must
exclude Chapter VII. ('Origin') on Instinct, which forms a chapter in
the first part of the Sketch, and Chapter VIII. ('Origin') on Hybridism,
a subject treated in the Sketch with 'Variation under Nature' in the
first part.

The following list of the chapters of the second part of the Sketch will
illustrate their correspondence with the final chapters of the 'Origin.'

Chapter I. "On the kind of intermediateness necessary, and the number
of such intermediate forms." This includes a geological discussion, and
corresponds to parts of Chapters VI. and IX. of the 'Origin.'

Chapter II. "The gradual appearance and disappearance of organic
beings." Corresponds to Chapter X. of the 'Origin.'

Chapter III. "Geographical Distribution." Corresponds to Chapters XI.
and XII. of the 'Origin.'

Chapter IV. "Affinities and Classification of Organic beings."

Chapter V. "Unity of Type," Morphology, Embryology.

Chapter VI. Rudimentary Organs.

These three chapters correspond to Chapter XII. of the 'Origin.'

Chapter VII. Recapitulation and Conclusion. The final sentence of the
Sketch, which we saw in its first rough form in the Note Book of 1837,
closely resembles the final sentence of the 'Origin,' much of it being
identical. The 'Origin' is not divided into two "Parts," but we see
traces of such a division having been present in the writer's mind, in
this resemblance between the second part of the Sketch and the final
chapters of the 'Origin.' That he should speak ('Origin,' Introduction,
page 5.) of the chapters on transition, on instinct, on hybridism, and
on the geological record, as forming a group, may be due to the division
of his early MS. into two parts.

Mr. Huxley, who was good enough to read the Sketch at my request, while
remarking that the "main lines of argument," and the illustrations
employed are the same, points out that in the 1844 Essay, "much more
weight is attached to the influence of external conditions in producing
variation, and to the inheritance of acquired habits than in the
Origin.'"

It is extremely interesting to find in the Sketch the first mention of
principles familiar to us in the 'Origin of Species.' Foremost among
these may be mentioned the principle of Sexual Selection, which
is clearly enunciated. The important form of selection known as
"unconscious," is also given. Here also occurs a statement of the
law that peculiarities tend to appear in the offspring at an age
corresponding to that at which they occurred in the parent.

Professor Newton, who was so kind as to look through the 1844
Sketch, tells me that my father's remarks on the migration of
birds, incidentally given in more than one passage, show that he had
anticipated the views of some later writers.

With regard to the general style of the Sketch, it is not to be expected
that it should have all the characteristics of the 'Origin,' and we
do not, in fact, find that balance and control, that concentration and
grasp, which are so striking in the work of 1859.

In the Autobiography (page 68, volume 1) my father has stated what
seemed to him the chief flaw of the 1844 Sketch; he had overlooked
"one problem of great importance," the problem of the divergence of
character. This point is discussed in the 'Origin of Species,' but, as
it may not be familiar to all readers, I will give a short account
of the difficulty and its solution. The author begins by stating that
varieties differ from each other less than species, and then goes on:
"Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in process of
formation...How then does the lesser difference between varieties become
augmented into the greater difference between species?" ('Origin,' 1st
edition, page 111.) He shows how an analogous divergence takes place
under domestication where an originally uniform stock of horses has
been split up into race-horses, dray-horses, etc., and then goes on to
explain how the same principle applies to natural species. "From the
simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any
one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much
will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified
places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in
numbers."

The principle is exemplified by the fact that if on one plot of ground
a single variety of wheat be sown, and on to another a mixture of
varieties, in the latter case the produce is greater. More individuals
have been able to exist because they were not all of the same variety.
An organism becomes more perfect and more fitted to survive when by
division of labour the different functions of life are performed by
different organs. In the same way a species becomes more efficient
and more able to survive when different sections of the species become
differentiated so as to fill different stations.

In reading the Sketch of 1844, I have found it difficult to recognise
the absence of any definite statement of the principle of divergence as
a flaw in the Essay. Descent with modification implies divergence,
and we become so habituated to a belief in descent, and therefore in
divergence, that we do not notice the absence of proof that divergence
is in itself an advantage. As shown in the Autobiography, my father in
1876 found it hardly credible that he should have overlooked the problem
and its solution.

The following letter will be more in place here than its chronological
position, since it shows what was my father's feeling as to the value of
the Sketch at the time of its completion.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO MRS. DARWIN. Down, July 5, 1844.

I have just finished my sketch of my species theory. If, as I believe,
my theory in time be accepted even by one competent judge, it will be a
considerable step in science.

I therefore write this in case of my sudden death, as my most solemn and
last request, which I am sure you will consider the same as if legally
entered in my will, that you will devote 400 pounds to its publication,
and further, will yourself, or through Hensleigh (Mr. H. Wedgwood.),
take trouble in promoting it. I wish that my sketch be given to some
competent person, with this sum to induce him to take trouble in its
improvement and enlargement. I give to him all my books on Natural
History, which are either scored or have references at the end to the
pages, begging him carefully to look over and consider such passages as
actually bearing, or by possibility bearing, on this subject. I wish you
to make a list of all such books as some temptation to an editor. I
also request that you will hand over [to] him all those scraps roughly
divided in eight or ten brown paper portfolios. The scraps, with copied
quotations from various works, are those which may aid my editor. I also
request that you, or some amanuensis, will aid in deciphering any of
the scraps which the editor may think possibly of use. I leave to the
editor's judgment whether to interpolate these facts in the text, or
as notes, or under appendices. As the looking over the references and
scraps will be a long labour, and as the CORRECTING and enlarging and
altering my sketch will also take considerable time, I leave this sum
of 400 pounds as some remuneration, and any profits from the work. I
consider that for this the editor is bound to get the sketch published
either at a publisher's or his own risk. Many of the scrap in the
portfolios contains mere rude suggestions and early views, now useless,
and many of the facts will probably turn out as having no bearing on my
theory.

With respect to editors, Mr. Lyell would be the best if he would
undertake it; I believe he would find the work pleasant, and he would
learn some facts new to him. As the editor must be a geologist as well
as a naturalist, the next best editor would be Professor Forbes of
London. The next best (and quite best in many respects) would be
Professor Henslow. Dr. Hooker would be VERY good. The next, Mr.
Strickland. (After Mr. Strickland's name comes the following sentence,
which has been erased but remained legible. "Professor Owen would be
very good; but I presume he would not undertake such a work." If none of
these would undertake it, I would request you to consult with Mr. Lyell,
or some other capable man for some editor, a geologist and naturalist.
Should one other hundred pounds make the difference of procuring a good
editor, request earnestly that you will raise 500 pounds.)

My remaining collections in Natural History may be given to any one or
any museum where it would be accepted...

[The following note seems to have formed part of the original letter,
but may have been of later date:

"Lyell, especially with the aid of Hooker (and of any good zoological
aid), would be best of all. Without an editor will pledge himself to
give up time to it, it would be of no use paying such a sum.

"If there should be any difficulty in getting an editor who would go
thoroughly into the subject, and think of the bearing of the passages
marked in the books and copied out of scraps of paper, then let my
sketch be published as it is, stating that it was done several years ago
(The words "several years ago and," seem to have been added at a
later date.) and from memory without consulting any works, and with no
intention of publication in its present form."

The idea that the Sketch of 1844 might remain, in the event of his
death, as the only record of his work, seems to have been long in his
mind, for in August 1854, when he had finished with the Cirripedes, and
was thinking of beginning his "species work," he added on the back of
the above letter, "Hooker by far best man to edit my species volume.
August 1854."]




CHAPTER 1.XI. -- THE GROWTH OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'

LETTERS, 1843-1856.


[The history of my father's life is told more completely in his
correspondence with Sir J.D. Hooker than in any other series of letters;
and this is especially true of the history of the growth of the 'Origin
of Species.' This, therefore, seems an appropriate place for the
following notes, which Sir Joseph Hooker has kindly given me. They
give, moreover, an interesting picture of his early friendship with my
father:--

"My first meeting with Mr. Darwin was in 1839, in Trafalgar Square. I
was walking with an officer who had been his shipmate for a short time
in the "Beagle" seven years before, but who had not, I believe, since
met him. I was introduced; the interview was of course brief, and the
memory of him that I carried away and still retain was that of a rather
tall and rather broad-shouldered man, with a slight stoop, an agreeable
and animated expression when talking, beetle brows, and a hollow
but mellow voice; and that his greeting of his old acquaintance was
sailor-like--that is, delightfully frank and cordial. I observed him
well, for I was already aware of his attainments and labours, derived
from having read various proof-sheets of his then unpublished 'Journal.'
These had been submitted to Mr. (afterwards Sir Charles) Lyell by Mr.
Darwin, and by him sent to his father, Ch. Lyell, Esq., of Kinnordy, who
(being a very old friend of my father and taking a kind interest in my
projected career as a naturalist) had allowed me to peruse them. At
this time I was hurrying on my studies, so as to take my degree before
volunteering to accompany Sir James Ross in the Antarctic Expedition,
which had just been determined on by the Admiralty; and so pressed for
time was I, that I used to sleep with the sheets of the 'Journal'
under my pillow, that I might read them between waking and rising. They
impressed me profoundly, I might say despairingly, with the variety of
acquirements, mental and physical, required in a naturalist who should
follow in Darwin's footsteps, whilst they stimulated me to enthusiasm in
the desire to travel and observe.

"It has been a permanent source of happiness to me that I knew so much
of Mr. Darwin's scientific work so many years before that intimacy began
which ripened into feelings as near to those of reverence for his life,
works, and character as is reasonable and proper. It only remains to
add to this little episode that I received a copy of the 'Journal'
complete,--a gift from Mr. Lyell,--a few days before leaving England.

"Very soon after the return of the Antarctic Expedition my
correspondence with Mr. Darwin began (December, 1843) by his sending me
a long letter, warmly congratulating me on my return to my family
and friends, and expressing a wish to hear more of the results of the
expedition, of which he had derived some knowledge from private letters
of my own (written to or communicated through Mr. Lyell). Then, plunging
at once into scientific matters, he directed my attention to the
importance of correlating the Fuegian Flora with that of the Cordillera
and of Europe, and invited me to study the botanical collections which
he had made in the Galapagos Islands, as well as his Patagonian and
Fuegian plants.

"This led to me sending him an outline of the conclusions I had formed
regarding the distribution of plants in the southern regions, and the
necessity of assuming the destruction of considerable areas of land
to account for the relations of the flora of the so-called Antarctic
Islands. I do not suppose that any of these ideas were new to him, but
they led to an animated and lengthy correspondence full of instruction."

Here follows the letter (1843) to Sir J.D. Hooker above referred to.]


My dear Sir,

I had hoped before this time to have had the pleasure of seeing you
and congratulating you on your safe return from your long and glorious
voyage. But as I seldom go to London, we may not yet meet for some
time--without you are led to attend the Geological Meetings.

I am anxious to know what you intend doing with all your materials--I
had so much pleasure in reading parts of some of your letters, that I
shall be very sorry if I, as one of the public, have no opportunity of
reading a good deal more. I suppose you are very busy now and full of
enjoyment: how well I remember the happiness of my first few months of
England--it was worth all the discomforts of many a gale! But I have run
from the subject, which made me write, of expressing my pleasure that
Henslow (as he informed me a few days since by letter) has sent to you
my small collection of plants. You cannot think how much pleased I am,
as I feared they would have been all lost, and few as they are, they
cost me a good deal of trouble. There are a very few notes, which I
believe Henslow has got, describing the habitats, etc., of some few of
the more remarkable plants. I paid particular attention to the Alpine
flowers of Tierra del Fuego, and I am sure I got every plant which was
in flower in Patagonia at the seasons when we were there. I have long
thought that some general sketch of the Flora of the point of land,
stretching so far into the southern seas, would be very curious. Do make
comparative remarks on the species allied to the European species, for
the advantage of botanical ignoramuses like myself. It has often struck
me as a curious point to find out, whether there are many European
genera in Tierra del Fuego which are not found along the ridge of the
Cordillera; the separation in such case would be so enormous. Do
point out in any sketch you draw up, what genera are American and what
European, and how great the differences of the species are, when the
genera are European, for the sake of the ignoramuses.

I hope Henslow will send you my Galapagos plants (about which Humboldt
even expressed to me considerable curiosity)--I took much pains in
collecting all I could. A Flora of this archipelago would, I suspect,
offer a nearly parallel case to that of St. Helena, which has so long
excited interest. Pray excuse this long rambling note, and believe me,
my dear sir, yours very sincerely,

C. DARWIN.

Will you be so good as to present my respectful compliments to Sir W.
Hooker.


[Referring to Sir J.D. Hooker's work on the Galapagos Flora, my father
wrote in 1846:

"I cannot tell you how delighted and astonished I am at the results
of your examination; how wonderfully they support my assertion on the
differences in the animals of the different islands, about which I have
always been fearful."


Again he wrote (1849):--

"I received a few weeks ago your Galapagos papers (These papers include
the results of Sir J.D. Hooker's examination of my father's Galapagos
plants, and were published by the Linnean Society in 1849.), and I have
read them since being here. I really cannot express too strongly my
admiration of the geographical discussion: to my judgment it is a
perfect model of what such a paper should be; it took me four days to
read and think over. How interesting the Flora of the Sandwich Islands
appears to be, how I wish there were materials for you to treat its
flora as you have done the Galapagos. In the Systematic paper I was
rather disappointed in not finding general remarks on affinities,
structures, etc., such as you often give in conversation, and such as
De Candolle and St. Hilaire introduced in almost all their papers, and
which make them interesting even to a non-Botanist."

"Very soon afterwards [continues Sir J.D. Hooker] in a letter dated
January 1844, the subject of the 'Origin of Species' was brought forward
by him, and I believe that I was the first to whom he communicated
his then new ideas on the subject, and which being of interest as
a contribution to the history of Evolution, I here copy from his
letter":--]

CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [January 11th, 1844.]

Besides a general interest about the southern lands, I have been now
ever since my return engaged in a very presumptuous work, and I know
no one individual who would not say a very foolish one. I was so struck
with the distribution of the Galapagos organisms, etc. etc., and with
the character of the American fossil mammifers, etc. etc., that I
determined to collect blindly every sort of fact, which could bear
any way on what are species. I have read heaps of agricultural and
horticultural books, and have never ceased collecting facts. At last
gleams of light have come, and I am almost convinced (quite contrary to
the opinion I started with) that species are not (it is like confessing
a murder) immutable. Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a
"tendency to progression," "adaptations from the slow willing of
animals," etc.! But the conclusions I am led to are not widely different
from his; though the means of change are wholly so. I think I have
found out (here's presumption!) the simple way by which species become
exquisitely adapted to various ends. You will now groan, and think to
yourself, "on what a man have I been wasting my time and writing to." I
should, five years ago, have thought so...


[The following letter written on February 23, 1844, shows that the
acquaintanceship with Sir J.D. Hooker was then fast ripening into
friendship. The letter is chiefly of interest as showing the sort of
problems then occupying my father's mind:]

Dear Hooker,

I hope you will excuse the freedom of my address, but I feel that as
co-circum-wanderers and as fellow labourers (though myself a very weak
one) we may throw aside some of the old-world formality...I have just
finished a little volume on the volcanic islands which we visited. I do
not know how far you care for dry simple geology, but I hope you will
let me send you a copy. I suppose I can send it from London by common
coach conveyance.

...I am going to ask you some MORE questions, though I daresay, without
asking them, I shall see answers in your work, when published, which
will be quite time enough for my purposes. First for the Galapagos, you
will see in my Journal, that the Birds, though peculiar species, have a
most obvious S. American aspect: I have just ascertained the same thing
holds good with the sea-shells. It is so with those plants which are
peculiar to this archipelago; you state that their numerical proportions
are continental (is not this a very curious fact?) but are they related
in forms to S. America. Do you know of any other case of an archipelago,
with the separate islands possessing distinct representative species?
I have always intended (but have not yet done so) to examine Webb
and Berthelot on the Canary Islands for this object. Talking with
Mr. Bentham, he told me that the separate islands of the Sandwich
Archipelago possessed distinct representative species of the same genera
of Labiatae: would not this be worth your enquiry? How is it with the
Azores; to be sure the heavy western gales would tend to diffuse the
same species over that group.

I hope you will (I dare say my hope is quite superfluous) attend to this
general kind of affinity in isolated islands, though I suppose it is
more difficult to perceive this sort of relation in plants, than in
birds or quadrupeds, the groups of which are, I fancy, rather more
confined. Can St. Helena be classed, though remotely, either with Africa
or S. America? From some facts, which I have collected, I have been led
to conclude that the fauna of mountains are EITHER remarkably similar
(sometimes in the presence of the same species and at other times
of same genera), OR that they are remarkably dissimilar; and it has
occurred to me that possibly part of this peculiarity of the St. Helena
and Galapagos floras may be attributed to a great part of these two
Floras being mountain Floras. I fear my notes will hardly serve to
distinguish much of the habitats of the Galapagos plants, but they may
in some cases; most, if not all, of the green, leafy plants come from
the summits of the islands, and the thin brown leafless plants come from
the lower arid parts: would you be so kind as to bear this remark in
mind, when examining my collection.

I will trouble you with only one other question. In discussion with Mr.
Gould, I found that in most of the genera of birds which range over the
whole or greater part of the world, the individual species have wider
ranges, thus the Owl is mundane, and many of the species have very wide
ranges. So I believe it is with land and fresh-water shells--and I might
adduce other cases. Is it not so with Cryptogamic plants; have not most
of the species wide ranges, in those genera which are mundane? I do not
suppose that the converse holds, viz.--that when a species has a
wide range, its genus also ranges wide. Will you so far oblige me by
occasionally thinking over this? It would cost me vast trouble to get a
list of mundane phanerogamic genera and then search how far the species
of these genera are apt to range wide in their several countries; but
you might occasionally, in the course of your pursuits, just bear this
in mind, though perhaps the point may long since have occurred to you
or other Botanists. Geology is bringing to light interesting facts,
concerning the ranges of shells; I think it is pretty well established,
that according as the geographical range of a species is wide, so is
its persistence and duration in time. I hope you will try to grudge as
little as you can the trouble of my letters, and pray believe me very
truly yours,

C. DARWIN.

P.S. I should feel extremely obliged for your kind offer of the sketch
of Humboldt; I venerate him, and after having had the pleasure of
conversing with him in London, I shall still more like to have any
portrait of him.


[What follows is quoted from Sir J. Hooker's notes. "The next act in the
drama of our lives opens with personal intercourse. This began with an
invitation to breakfast with him at his brother's (Erasmus Darwin's)
house in Park Street; which was shortly afterwards followed by an
invitation to Down to meet a few brother Naturalists. In the short
intervals of good health that followed the long illnesses which
oftentimes rendered life a burthen to him, between 1844 and 1847, I had
many such invitations, and delightful they were. A more hospitable and
more attractive home under every point of view could not be imagined--of
Society there were most often Dr. Falconer, Edward Forbes, Professor
Bell, and Mr. Waterhouse--there were long walks, romps with the children
on hands and knees, music that haunts me still. Darwin's own hearty
manner, hollow laugh, and thorough enjoyment of home life with friends;
strolls with him all together, and interviews with us one by one in
his study, to discuss questions in any branch of biological or physical
knowledge that we had followed; and which I at any rate always left with
the feeling that I had imparted nothing and carried away more than
I could stagger under. Latterly, as his health became more seriously
affected, I was for days and weeks the only visitor, bringing my work
with me and enjoying his society as opportunity offered. It was an
established rule that he every day pumped me, as he called it, for half
an hour or so after breakfast in his study, when he first brought out
a heap of slips with questions botanical, geographical, etc., for me to
answer, and concluded by telling me of the progress he had made in his
own work, asking my opinion on various points. I saw no more of him till
about noon, when I heard his mellow ringing voice calling my name under
my window--this was to join him in his daily forenoon walk round the
sand-walk. On joining him I found him in a rough grey shooting-coat in
summer, and thick cape over his shoulders in winter, and a stout staff
in his hand; away we trudged through the garden, where there was always
some experiment to visit, and on to the sand-walk, round which a fixed
number of turns were taken, during which our conversation usually ran
on foreign lands and seas, old friends, old books, and things far off to
both mind and eye.

"In the afternoon there was another such walk, after which he again
retired till dinner if well enough to join the family; if not, he
generally managed to appear in the drawing-room, where seated in his
high chair, with his feet in enormous carpet shoes, supported on a high
stool--he enjoyed the music or conversation of his family."


Here follows a series of letters illustrating the growth of my father's
views, and the nature of his work during this period.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1844].

...The conclusion, which I have come at is, that those areas, in which
species are most numerous, have oftenest been divided and isolated from
other areas, united and again divided; a process implying antiquity and
some changes in the external conditions. This will justly sound very
hypothetical. I cannot give my reasons in detail; but the most general
conclusion, which the geographical distribution of all organic beings,
appears to me to indicate, is that isolation is the chief concomitant or
cause of the appearance of NEW forms (I well know there are some staring
exceptions). Secondly, from seeing how often the plants and animals
swarm in a country, when introduced into it, and from seeing what a vast
number of plants will live, for instance in England, if kept FREE FROM
WEEDS, AND NATIVE PLANTS, I have been led to consider that the spreading
and number of the organic beings of any country depend less on its
external features, than on the number of forms, which have been there
originally created or produced. I much doubt whether you will find it
possible to explain the number of forms by proportional differences of
exposure; and I cannot doubt if half the species in any country were
destroyed or had not been created, yet that country would appear to us
fully peopled. With respect to original creation or production of new
forms, I have said that isolation appears the chief element. Hence,
with respect to terrestrial productions, a tract of country, which had
oftenest within the late geological periods subsided and been converted
into islands, and reunited, I should expect to contain most forms.

But such speculations are amusing only to one self, and in this case
useless, as they do not show any direct line of observation: if I had
seen how hypothetical [is] the little, which I have unclearly written, I
would not have troubled you with the reading of it. Believe me,--at last
not hypothetically,

Yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 1844.

...I forget my last letter, but it must have been a very silly one, as
it seems I gave my notion of the number of species being in great degree
governed by the degree to which the area had been often isolated and
divided; I must have been cracked to have written it, for I have no
evidence, without a person be willing to admit all my views, and then
it does follow; but in my most sanguine moments, all I expect, is that
I shall be able to show even to sound Naturalists, that there are two
sides to the question of the immutability of species;--that facts can be
viewed and grouped under the notion of allied species having descended
from common stocks. With respect to books on this subject, I do not know
of any systematical ones, except Lamarck's, which is veritable rubbish;
but there are plenty, as Lyell, Pritchard, etc., on the view of the
immutability. Agassiz lately has brought the strongest argument in
favour of immutability. Isidore G. St. Hilaire has written some good
Essays, tending towards the mutability-side, in the 'Suites a Buffon,'
entitled "Zoolog. Generale." Is it not strange that the author, of
such a book as the 'Animaux sans Vertebres,' should have written that
insects, which never see their eggs, should WILL (and plants, their
seeds) to be of particular forms, so as to become attached to particular
objects. The other, common (specially Germanic) notion is hardly less
absurd, viz. that climate, food, etc., should make a Pediculus formed to
climb hair, or wood-pecker, to climb trees. I believe all these absurd
views arise, from no one having, as far as I know, approached the
subject on the side of variation under domestication, and having studied
all that is known about domestication. I was very glad to hear your
criticism on island-floras and on non-diffusion of plants: the subject
is too long for a letter: I could defend myself to some considerable
extent, but I doubt whether successfully in your eyes, or indeed in my
own...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [July, 1844].

...I am now reading a wonderful book for facts on variation--Bronn,
'Geschichte der Natur.' It is stiff German: it forestalls me, sometimes
I think delightfully, and sometimes cruelly. You will be ten times
hereafter more horrified at me than at H. Watson. I hate arguments from
results, but on my views of descent, really Natural History becomes
a sublimely grand result-giving subject (now you may quiz me for so
foolish an escape of mouth)...I must leave this letter till to-morrow,
for I am tired; but I so enjoy writing to you, that I must inflict a
little more on you.

Have you any good evidence for absence of insects in small islands? I
found thirteen species in Keeling Atoll. Flies are good fertilizers,
and I have seen a microscopic Thrips and a Cecidomya take flight from
a flower in the direction of another with pollen adhering to them. In
Arctic countries a bee seems to go as far N. as any flower...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Shrewsbury [September, 1845].

My dear Hooker,

I write a line to say that Cosmos (A translation of Humboldt's
'Kosmos.') arrived quite safely [N.B. One sheet came loose in Part I.],
and to thank you for your nice note. I have just begun the introduction,
and groan over the style, which in such parts is full half the battle.
How true many of the remarks are (i.e. as far as I can understand the
wretched English) on the scenery; it is an exact expression of one's own
thoughts.

I wish I ever had any books to lend you in return for the many you have
lent me...

All of what you kindly say about my species work does not alter one
iota my long self-acknowledged presumption in accumulating facts and
speculating on the subject of variation, without having worked out my
due share of species. But now for nine years it has been anyhow the
greatest amusement to me.

Farewell, my dear Hooker, I grieve more than you can well believe, over
our prospect of so seldom meeting.

I have never perceived but one fault in you, and that you have
grievously, viz. modesty; you form an exception to Sydney Smith's
aphorism, that merit and modesty have no other connection, except in
their first letter.

Farewell, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS (BLOMEFIELD). Down, October 12th, [1845].

My dear Jenyns,

Thanks for your note. I am sorry to say I have not even the tail-end
of a fact in English Zoology to communicate. I have found that even
trifling observations require, in my case, some leisure and energy, both
of which ingredients I have had none to spare, as writing my Geology
thoroughly expends both. I had always thought that I would keep a
journal and record everything, but in the way I now live I find I
observe nothing to record. Looking after my garden and trees, and
occasionally a very little walk in an idle frame of mind, fills up every
afternoon in the same manner. I am surprised that with all your parish
affairs, you have had time to do all that which you have done. I shall
be very glad to see your little work (Mr. Jenyns' 'Observations in
Natural History.' It is prefaced by an Introduction on "Habits of
observing as connected with the study of Natural History," and followed
by a "Calendar of Periodic Phenomena in Natural History," with "Remarks
on the importance of such Registers." My father seems to be alluding to
this Register in the P.S. to the letter dated October 17, 1846.) (and
proud should I have been if I could have added a single fact to it).
My work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with
the importance of all such works as your intended one, containing what
people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts
which make one understand the working or economy of nature. There is
one subject, on which I am very curious, and which perhaps you may throw
some light on, if you have ever thought on it; namely, what are the
checks and what the periods of life,--by which the increase of any given
species is limited. Just calculate the increase of any bird, if you
assume that only half the young are reared, and these breed: within the
NATURAL (i.e., if free from accidents) life of the parents the number
of individuals will become enormous, and I have been much surprised to
think how great destruction MUST annually or occasionally be falling on
every species, yet the means and period of such destruction is scarcely
perceived by us.

I have continued steadily reading and collecting facts on variation of
domestic animals and plants, and on the question of what are species.
I have a grand body of facts, and I think I can draw some sound
conclusions. The general conclusions at which I have slowly been driven
from a directly opposite conviction, is that species are mutable, and
that allied species are co-descendants from common stocks. I know how
much I open myself to reproach for such a conclusion, but I have at
least honestly and deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on
this subject for several years. At present I am on the Geology of
South America. I hope to pick up from your book some facts on
slight variations in structure or instincts in the animals of your
acquaintance.

Believe me, ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS (REV. L. BLOMEFIELD). Down, [1845?].

My dear Jenyns,

I am very much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken in having
written me so long a note. The question of where, when, and how
the check to the increase of a given species falls appears to me
particularly interesting, and our difficulty in answering it shows how
really ignorant we are of the lives and habits of our most familiar
species. I was aware of the bare fact of old birds driving away their
young, but had never thought of the effect you so clearly point out, of
local gaps in number being thus immediately filled up. But the original
difficulty remains; for if your farmers had not killed your sparrows
and rooks, what would have become of those which now immigrate into your
parish? in the middle of England one is too far distant from the natural
limits of the rook and sparrow to suppose that the young are thus far
expelled from Cambridgeshire. The check must fall heavily at some time
of each species' life; for, if one calculates that only half the progeny
are reared and bred, how enormous is the increase! One has, however, no
business to feel so much surprise at one's ignorance, when one knows how
impossible it is without statistics to conjecture the duration of life
and percentage of deaths to births in mankind. If it could be shown that
apparently the birds of passage WHICH BREED HERE and increase, return in
the succeeding years in about the same number, whereas those that come
here for their winter and non-breeding season annually, come here with
the same numbers, but return with greatly decreased numbers, one
would know (as indeed seems probable) that the check fell chiefly on
full-grown birds in the winter season, and not on the eggs and very
young birds, which has appeared to me often the most probable period. If
at any time any remarks on this subject should occur to you, I should be
most grateful for the benefit of them.

With respect to my far distant work on species, I must have expressed
myself with singular inaccuracy if I led you to suppose that I meant
to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after
years of weighing puzzles, to myself ALONE; but in my wildest day-dream,
I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides to
the question of the immutability of species, i.e. whether species are
DIRECTLY created or by intermediate laws (as with the life and death
of individuals). I did not approach the subject on the side of the
difficulty in determining what are species and what are varieties, but
(though, why I should give you such a history of my doings it would be
hard to say) from such facts as the relationship between the living
and extinct mammifers in South America, and between those living on the
Continent and on adjoining islands, such as the Galapagos. It occured
to me that a collection of all such analogous facts would throw light
either for or against the view of related species being co-descendants
from a common stock. A long searching amongst agricultural and
horticultural books and people makes me believe (I well know how
absurdly presumptuous this must appear) that I see the way in which new
varieties become exquisitely adapted to the external conditions of life
and to other surrounding beings. I am a bold man to lay myself open
to being thought a complete fool, and a most deliberate one. From the
nature of the grounds which make me believe that species are mutable in
form, these grounds cannot be restricted to the closest-allied species;
but how far they extend I cannot tell, as my reasons fall away by
degrees, when applied to species more and more remote from each other.
Pray do not think that I am so blind as not to see that there are
numerous immense difficulties in my notions, but they appear to me less
than on the common view. I have drawn up a sketch and had it copied (in
200 pages) of my conclusions; and if I thought at some future time that
you would think it worth reading, I should, of course, be most thankful
to have the criticism of so competent a critic. Excuse this very long
and egotistical and ill-written letter, which by your remarks you had
led me into, and believe me,

Yours very truly, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS (BLOMEFIELD). Down, October 17th, 1846.

Dear Jenyns,

I have taken a most ungrateful length of time in thanking you for your
very kind present of your 'Observations.' But I happened to have had in
hand several other books, and have finished yours only a few days ago.
I found it very pleasant reading, and many of your facts interested me
much. I think I was more interested, which is odd, with your notes on
some of the lower animals than on the higher ones. The introduction
struck me as very good; but this is what I expected, for I well remember
being quite delighted with a preliminary essay to the first number of
the 'Annals of Natural History.' I missed one discussion, and think
myself ill-used, for I remember your saying you would make some remarks
on the weather and barometer, as a guide for the ignorant in prediction.
I had also hoped to have perhaps met with some remarks on the amount of
variation in our common species. Andrew Smith once declared he would get
some hundreds of specimens of larks and sparrows from all parts of Great
Britain, and see whether, with finest measurements, he could detect any
proportional variations in beaks or limbs, etc. This point interests me
from having lately been skimming over the absurdly opposite conclusions
of Gloger and Brehm; the one making half-a-dozen species out of every
common bird, and the other turning so many reputed species into one.
Have you ever done anything of this kind, or have you ever studied
Gloger's or Brehm's works? I was interested in your account of the
martins, for I had just before been utterly perplexed by noticing just
such a proceeding as you describe: I counted seven, one day lately,
visiting a single nest and sticking dirt on the adjoining wall. I may
mention that I once saw some squirrels eagerly splitting those little
semi-transparent spherical galls on the back of oak-leaves for the
maggot within; so that they are insectivorous. A Cychrus rostratus once
squirted into my eyes and gave me extreme pain; and I must tell you what
happened to me on the banks of the Cam, in my early entomological days:
under a piece of bark I found two Carabi (I forget which), and caught
one in each hand, when lo and behold I saw a sacred Panagaeus crux
major! I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, and to lose
Panagaeus was out of the question; so that in despair I gently seized
one of the Carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust and
pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat,
and I lost both Carabi and Panagaeus! I was quite astonished to hear of
a terrestrial Planaria; for about a year or two ago I described in the
'Annals of Natural History' several beautifully coloured terrestrial
species of the Southern Hemisphere, and thought it quite a new fact.
By the way, you speak of a sheep with a broken leg not having flukes:
I have heard my father aver that a fever, or any SERIOUS ACCIDENT, as
a broken limb, will cause in a man all the intestinal worms to be
evacuated. Might not this possibly have been the case with the flukes in
their early state?

I hope you were none the worse for Southampton (The meeting of the
British Association.); I wish I had seen you looking rather fatter. I
enjoyed my week extremely, and it did me good. I missed you the last few
days, and we never managed to see much of each other; but there were so
many people there, that I for one hardly saw anything of any one. Once
again I thank you very cordially for your kind present, and the pleasure
it has given me, and believe me,

Ever most truly yours, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--I have quite forgotten to say how greatly interested I was with
your discussion on the statistics of animals: when will Natural History
be so perfect that such points as you discuss will be perfectly known
about any one animal?


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Malvern, June 13 [1849].

...At last I am going to press with a small poor first-fruit of my
confounded Cirripedia, viz. the fossil pedunculate cirripedia. You ask
what effect studying species has had on my variation theories; I do not
think much--I have felt some difficulties more. On the other hand,
I have been struck (and probably unfairly from the class) with the
variability of every part in some slight degree of every species. When
the same organ is RIGOROUSLY compared in many individuals, I always find
some slight variability, and consequently that the diagnosis of species
from minute differences is always dangerous. I had thought the same
parts of the same species more resemble (than they do anyhow in
Cirripedia) objects cast in the same mould. Systematic work would be
easy were it not for this confounded variation, which, however, is
pleasant to me as a speculatist, though odious to me as a systematist.
Your remarks on the distinctness (so unpleasant to me) of the Himalayan
Rubi, willows, etc., compared with those of northern [Europe?], etc.,
are very interesting; if my rude species-sketch had any SMALL share in
leading you to these observations, it has already done good and ample
service, and may lay its bones in the earth in peace. I never heard
anything so strange as Falconer's neglect of your letters; I am
extremely glad you are cordial with him again, though it must have cost
you an effort. Falconer is a man one must love...May you prosper in
every way, my dear Hooker.

Your affectionate friend, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Wednesday [September, n.d.].

...Many thanks for your letter received yesterday, which, as always,
set me thinking: I laughed at your attack at my stinginess in changes of
level towards Forbes (Edward Forbes, 1815-1854, born in the Isle of Man.
His best known work was his Report on the distribution of marine animals
at different depths in the Mediterranean. An important memoir of his
is referred to in my father's 'Autobiography.' He held successively the
posts of Curator to the Geological Society's Museum, and Professor of
Natural History in the Museum of Practical Geology; shortly before he
died he was appointed Professor of Natural History in the University
of Edinburgh. He seems to have impressed his contemporaries as a man of
strikingly versatile and vigorous mind. The above allusion to changes of
level refers to Forbes's tendency to explain the facts of geographical
distribution by means of an active geological imagination.), being so
liberal towards myself; but I must maintain, that I have never let down
or upheaved our mother-earth's surface, for the sake of explaining any
one phenomenon, and I trust I have very seldom done so without some
distinct evidence. So I must still think it a bold step (perhaps a
very true one) to sink into the depths of ocean, within the period of
existing species, so large a tract of surface. But there is no amount or
extent of change of level, which I am not fully prepared to admit, but
I must say I should like better evidence, than the identity of a few
plants, which POSSIBLY (I do not say probably) might have been otherwise
transported. Particular thanks for your attempt to get me a copy of
'L'Espece' (Probably Godron's essay, published by the Academy of Nancy
in 1848-49, and afterwards as a separate book in 1859.), and almost
equal thanks for your criticisms on him: I rather misdoubted him, and
felt not much inclined to take as gospel his facts. I find this one of
my greatest difficulties with foreign authors, viz. judging of their
credibility. How painfully (to me) true is your remark, that no one has
hardly a right to examine the question of species who has not minutely
described many. I was, however, pleased to hear from Owen (who is
vehemently opposed to any mutability in species), that he thought it was
a very fair subject, and that there was a mass of facts to be brought to
bear on the question, not hitherto collected. My only comfort is (as I
mean to attempt the subject), that I have dabbled in several branches
of Natural History, and seen good specific men work out my species, and
know something of geology (an indispensable union); and though I shall
get more kicks than half-pennies, I will, life serving, attempt my
work. Lamarck is the only exception, that I can think of, of an accurate
describer of species at least in the Invertebrate Kingdom, who has
disbelieved in permanent species, but he in his absurd though clever
work has done the subject harm, as has Mr. Vestiges, and, as (some
future loose naturalist attempting the same speculations will perhaps
say) has Mr. D...

C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 25th [1853].

My dear Hooker,

I have read your paper with great interest; it seems all very clear, and
will form an admirable introduction to the New Zealand Flora, or to any
Flora in the world. How few generalizers there are among systematists;
I really suspect there is something absolutely opposed to each other
and hostile in the two frames of mind required for systematising and
reasoning on large collections of facts. Many of your arguments appear
to me very well put, and, as far as my experience goes, the candid
way in which you discuss the subject is unique. The whole will be very
useful to me whenever I undertake my volume, though parts take the wind
very completely out of my sails; it will be all nuts to me...for I have
for some time determined to give the arguments on BOTH sides (as far as
I could), instead of arguing on the mutability side alone.

In my own Cirripedial work (by the way, thank you for the dose of soft
solder; it does one--or at least me--a great deal of good)--in my own
work I have not felt conscious that disbelieving in the mere PERMANENCE
of species has made much difference one way or the other; in some few
cases (if publishing avowedly on doctrine of non-permanence), I should
NOT have affixed names, and in some few cases should have affixed
names to remarkable varieties. Certainly I have felt it humiliating,
discussing and doubting, and examining over and over again, when in
my own mind the only doubt has been whether the form varied TO-DAY OR
YESTERDAY (not to put too fine a point on it, as Snagsby (In 'Bleak
House.') would say). After describing a set of forms as distinct
species, tearing up my MS., and making them one species, tearing that
up and making them separate, and then making them one again (which has
happened to me), I have gnashed my teeth, cursed species, and asked what
sin I had committed to be so punished. But I must confess that perhaps
nearly the same thing would have happened to me on any scheme of work.

I am heartily glad to hear your Journal (Sir J.D. Hooker's 'Himalayan
Journal.') is so much advanced; how magnificently it seems to be
illustrated! An "Oriental Naturalist," with lots of imagination and not
too much regard to facts, is just the man to discuss species! I think
your title of 'A Journal of a Naturalist in the East' very good; but
whether "in the Himalaya" would not be better, I have doubted, for the
East sounds rather vague...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [1853].

My dear Hooker,

I have no remarks at all worth sending you, nor, indeed, was it likely
that I should, considering how perfect and elaborated an essay it is.
('New Zealand Flora,' 1853.) As far as my judgment goes, it is the most
important discussion on the points in question ever published. I can say
no more. I agree with almost everything you say; but I require much time
to digest an essay of such quality. It almost made me gloomy, partly
from feeling I could not answer some points which theoretically I should
have liked to have been different, and partly from seeing SO FAR BETTER
DONE than I COULD have done, discussions on some points which I had
intended to have taken up...

I much enjoyed the slaps you have given to the provincial
species-mongers. I wish I could have been of the slightest use: I have
been deeply interested by the whole essay, and congratulate you on
having produced a memoir which I believe will be memorable. I was deep
in it when your most considerate note arrived, begging me not to hurry.
I thank Mrs. Hooker and yourself most sincerely for your wish to see me.
I will not let another summer pass without seeing you at Kew, for indeed
I should enjoy it much...

You do me really more honour than I have any claim to, putting me in
after Lyell on ups and downs. In a year or two's time, when I shall be
at my species book (if I do not break down), I shall gnash my teeth and
abuse you for having put so many hostile facts so confoundedly well.

Ever yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 26th [1854].

My dear Hooker,

I had hoped that you would have had a little breathing-time after your
Journal, but this seems to be very far from the case; and I am the
more obliged (and somewhat contrite) for the long letter received this
morning, MOST juicy with news and MOST interesting to me in many ways. I
am very glad indeed to hear of the reforms, etc., in the Royal Society.
With respect to the Club (The Philosophical Club, to which my father was
elected (as Professor Bonney is good enough to inform me) on April 24,
1854. He resigned his membership in 1864. The Club was founded in 1847.
The number of members being limited to 47, it was proposed to christen
it "the Club of 47," but the name was never adopted. The nature of the
Club may be gathered from its first rule: "The purpose of the Club is to
promote as much as possible the scientific objects of the Royal Society;
to facilitate intercourse between those Fellows who are actively engaged
in cultivating the various branches of Natural Science, and who have
contributed to its progress; to increase the attendance at the evening
meetings, and to encourage the contribution and discussion of papers."
The Club met for dinner (at first) at 6, and the chair was to be quitted
at 8.15, it being expected that members would go to the Royal Society.
Of late years the dinner has been at 6.30, the Society meeting in the
afternoon.), I am deeply interested; only two or three days ago, I
was regretting to my wife, how I was letting drop and being dropped by
nearly all my acquaintances, and that I would endeavour to go oftener
to London; I was not then thinking of the Club, which, as far as any one
thing goes, would answer my exact object in keeping up old and making
some new acquaintances. I will therefore come up to London for every
(with rare exceptions) Club-day, and then my head, I think, will allow
me on an average to go to every other meeting. But it is grievous how
often any change knocks me up. I will further pledge myself, as I told
Lyell, to resign after a year, if I did not attend pretty often, so
that I should AT WORST encumber the Club temporarily. If you can get me
elected, I certainly shall be very much pleased. Very many thanks for
answers about Glaciers. I am very glad to hear of the second Edition (Of
the Himalayan Journal.) so very soon; but am not surprised, for I
have heard of several, in our small circle, reading it with very much
pleasure. I shall be curious to hear what Humboldt will say: it will, I
should think, delight him, and meet with more praise from him than any
other book of Travels, for I cannot remember one, which has so many
subjects in common with him. What a wonderful old fellow he is...By the
way, I hope, when you go to Hitcham, towards the end of May, you will be
forced to have some rest. I am grieved to hear that all the bad symptoms
have not left Henslow; it is so strange and new to feel any uneasiness
about his health. I am particularly obliged to you for sending me
Asa Gray's letter; how very pleasantly he writes. To see his and your
caution on the species-question ought to overwhelm me in confusion and
shame; it does make me feel deuced uncomfortable...It is delightful
to hear all that he says on Agassiz: how very singular it is that so
EMINENTLY clever a man, with such IMMENSE knowledge on many branches of
Natural History, should write as he does. Lyell told me that he was so
delighted with one of his (Agassiz) lectures on progressive development,
etc., etc., that he went to him afterwards and told him, "that it was so
delightful, that he could not help all the time wishing it was true." I
seldom see a Zoological paper from North America, without observing the
impress of Agassiz's doctrines--another proof, by the way, of how great
a man he is. I was pleased and surprised to see A. Gray's remarks on
crossing, obliterating varieties, on which, as you know, I have been
collecting facts for these dozen years. How awfully flat I shall feel,
if when I get my notes together on species, etc., etc., the whole thing
explodes like an empty puff-ball. Do not work yourself to death.

Ever yours most truly, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 5th [1854].

My dear Hooker,

I was delighted to get your note yesterday. I congratulate you very
heartily (On the award to him of the Royal Society's Medal.), and
whether you care much or little, I rejoice to see the highest scientific
judgment-court in Great Britain recognise your claims. I do hope Mrs.
Hooker is pleased, and E. desires me particularly to send her cordial
congratulations ...I pity you from the very bottom of my heart about
your after-dinner speech, which I fear I shall not hear. Without you
have a very much greater soul than I have (and I believe that you have),
you will find the medal a pleasant little stimulus, when work goes
badly, and one ruminates that all is vanity, it is pleasant to have some
tangible proof, that others have thought something of one's labours.

Good-bye my dear Hooker, I can assure [you] that we both most truly
enjoyed your and Mrs. Hooker's visit here. Farewell.

My dear Hooker, your sincere friend, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. March 7 [1855].

...I have just finished working well at Wollaston's (Thomas Vernon
Wollaston died (in his fifty-seventh year, as I believe) on January 4,
1878. His health forcing him in early manhood to winter in the south,
he devoted himself to a study of the Coleoptera of Madeira, the Cape
de Verdes, and St. Helena, whence he deduced evidence in support of the
belief in the submerged continent of 'Atlantis.' In an obituary notice
by Mr. Rye ('Nature,' 1878) he is described as working persistently
"upon a broad conception of the science to which he was devoted," while
being at the same time "accurate, elaborate, and precise ad punctum, and
naturally of a minutely critical habit." His first scientific paper was
written when he was an undergraduate at Jesus College, Cambridge. While
at the University, he was an Associate and afterwards a Member of the
Ray Club: this is a small society which still meets once a week, and
where the undergraduate members, or Associates, receive much kindly
encouragement from their elders.) 'Insecta Maderensia': it is an
ADMIRABLE work. There is a very curious point in the astounding
proportion of Coleoptera that are apterous; and I think I have guessed
the reason, viz., that powers of flight would be injurious to insects
inhabiting a confined locality, and expose them to be blown to the sea:
to test this, I find that the insects inhabiting the Dezerte Grande, a
quite small islet, would be still more exposed to this danger, and here
the proportion of apterous insects is even considerably greater than on
Madeira Proper. Wollaston speaks of Madeira and the other Archipelagoes
as being "sure and certain witnesses of Forbes' old continent," and of
course the Entomological world implicitly follows this view. But to my
eyes it would be difficult to imagine facts more opposed to such a
view. It is really disgusting and humiliating to see directly opposite
conclusions drawn from the same facts.

I have had some correspondence with Wollaston on this and other
subjects, and I find that he coolly assumes, (1) that formerly insects
possessed greater migratory powers than now, (2) that the old land was
SPECIALLY rich in centres of creation, (3) that the uniting land was
destroyed before the special creations had time to diffuse, and (4) that
the land was broken down before certain families and genera had time
to reach from Europe or Africa the points of land in question. Are not
these a jolly lot of assumptions? and yet I shall see for the next dozen
or score of years Wollaston quoted as proving the former existence of
poor Forbes' Atlantis.

I hope I have not wearied you, but I thought you would like to hear
about this book, which strikes me as EXCELLENT in its facts, and the
author a most nice and modest man.

Most truly yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, March 19th [1855].

My dear Fox,

How long it is since we have had any communication, and I really want to
hear how the world goes with you; but my immediate object is to ask you
to observe a point for me, and as I know now you are a very busy man
with too much to do, I shall have a good chance of your doing what I
want, as it would be hopeless to ask a quite idle man. As you have a
Noah's Ark, I do not doubt that you have pigeons. (How I wish by any
chance they were fantails!) Now what I want to know is, at what age
nestling pigeons have their tail feathers sufficiently developed to be
counted. I do not think I ever saw a young pigeon. I am hard at work at
my notes collecting and comparing them, in order in some two or three
years to write a book with all the facts and arguments, which I can
collect, FOR AND VERSUS the immutability of species. I want to get the
young of our domestic breeds, to see how young, and to what degree the
differences appear. I must either breed myself (which is no amusement
but a horrid bore to me) the pigeons or buy their young; and before I go
to a seller, whom I have heard of from Yarrell, I am really anxious
to know something about their development, not to expose my excessive
ignorance, and therefore be excessively liable to be cheated and gulled.
With respect to the ONE point of the tail feathers, it is of course
in relation to the wonderful development of tail feathers in the adult
fantail. If you had any breed of poultry pure, I would beg a chicken
with exact age stated, about a week or fortnight old! To be sent in
a box by post, if you could have the heart to kill one; and secondly,
would let me pay postage...Indeed, I should be very glad to have a
nestling common pigeon sent, for I mean to make skeletons, and have
already just begun comparing wild and tame ducks. And I think the
results rather curious ("I have just been testing practically what
disuse does in reducing parts; I have made skeleton of wild and
tame duck (oh, the smell of well-boiled, high duck!!) and I find the
tame-duck wing ought, according to scale of wild prototype, to have its
two wings 360 grains in weight, but it has it only 317."--A letter to
Sir J. Hooker, 1855.), for on weighing the several bones very carefully,
when perfectly cleaned the proportional weights of the two have greatly
varied, the foot of the tame having largely increased. How I wish I
could get a little wild duck of a week old, but that I know is almost
impossible.

With respect to ourselves, I have not much to say; we have now a
terribly noisy house with the whooping cough, but otherwise are all
well. Far the greatest fact about myself is that I have at last quite
done with the everlasting barnacles. At the end of the year we had two
of our little boys very ill with fever and bronchitis, and all sorts of
ailments. Partly for amusement, and partly for change of air, we went to
London and took a house for a month, but it turned out a great failure,
for that dreadful frost just set in when we went, and all our children
got unwell, and E. and I had coughs and colds and rheumatism nearly all
the time. We had put down first on our list of things to do, to go and
see Mrs. Fox, but literally after waiting some time to see whether the
weather would not improve, we had not a day when we both could go out.

I do hope before very long you will be able to manage to pay us a visit.
Time is slipping away, and we are getting oldish. Do tell us about
yourself and all your large family.

I know you will help me IF YOU CAN with information about the young
pigeons; and anyhow do write before very long.

My dear Fox, your sincere old friend, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--Amongst all sorts of odds and ends, with which I am amusing
myself, I am comparing the seeds of the variations of plants. I had
formerly some wild cabbage seeds, which I gave to some one, was it to
you? It is a THOUSAND to one it was thrown away, if not I should be very
glad of a pinch of it.


[The following extract from a letter to Mr. Fox (March 27th, 1855)
refers to the same subject as the last letter, and gives some account
of the "species work:" "The way I shall kill young things will be to put
them under a tumbler glass with a teaspoon of ether or chloroform, the
glass being pressed down on some yielding surface, and leave them for an
hour or two, young have such power of revivication. (I have thus killed
moths and butterflies.) The best way would be to send them as you
procure them, in pasteboard chip-box by post, on which you could write
and just tie up with string; and you will REALLY make me happier by
allowing me to keep an account of postage, etc. Upon my word I can
hardly believe that ANY ONE could be so good-natured as to take such
trouble and do such a very disagreeable thing as kill babies; and I am
very sure I do not know one soul who, except yourself, would do so. I am
going to ask one thing more; should old hens of any above poultry (not
duck) die or become so old as to be USELESS, I wish you would send her
to me per rail, addressed to C. Darwin, care of Mr. Acton, Post-office,
Bromley, Kent." Will you keep this address? as shortest way for parcels.
But I do not care so much for this, as I could buy the old birds dead at
Baily to make skeletons. I should have written at once even if I had
not heard from you, to beg you not to take trouble about pigeons, for
Yarrell has persuaded me to attempt it, and I am now fitting up a place,
and have written to Baily about prices, etc., etc. SOMETIME (when you
are better) I should like very much to hear a little about your
"Little Call Duck"; why so-called? And where you got it? and what it is
like?... I was so ignorant I do not even know there were three varieties
of Dorking fowl: how do they differ?...

I forget whether I ever told you what the object of my present work
is,--it is to view all facts that I can master (eheu, eheu, how ignorant
I find I am) in Natural History (as on geographical distribution,
palaeontology, classification, hybridism, domestic animals and plants,
etc., etc., etc.) to see how far they favour or are opposed to the
notion that wild species are mutable or immutable: I mean with my utmost
power to give all arguments and facts on both sides. I have a NUMBER of
people helping me in every way, and giving me most valuable assistance;
but I often doubt whether the subject will not quite overpower me.

So much for the quasi-business part of my letter. I am very very sorry
to hear so indifferent account of your health: with your large family
your life is very precious, and I am sure with all your activity and
goodness it ought to be a happy one, or as happy as can reasonably be
expected with all the cares of futurity on one.

One cannot expect the present to be like the old Crux-major days at the
foot of those noble willow stumps, the memory of which I revere. I
now find my little entomology which I wholly owe to you, comes in very
useful. I am very glad to hear that you have given yourself a rest from
Sunday duties. How much illness you have had in your life! Farewell
my dear Fox. I assure you I thank you heartily for your proffered
assistance.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, May 7th [1855].

My dear Fox,

My correspondence has cost you a deal of trouble, though this note will
not. I found yours on my return home on Saturday after a week's work
in London. Whilst there I saw Yarrell, who told me he had carefully
examined all points in the Call Duck, and did not feel any doubt about
it being specifically identical, and that it had crossed freely with
common varieties in St. James's Park. I should therefore be very glad
for a seven-days' duckling and for one of the old birds, should one ever
die a natural death. Yarrell told me that Sabine had collected forty
varieties of the common duck!...Well, to return to business; nobody,
I am sure, could fix better for me than you the characteristic age of
little chickens; with respect to skeletons, I have feared it would be
impossible to make them, but I suppose I shall be able to measure limbs,
etc., by feeling the joints. What you say about old cocks just confirms
what I thought, and I will make my skeletons of old cocks. Should an
old wild turkey ever die, please remember me; I do not care for a baby
turkey, nor for a mastiff. Very many thanks for your offer. I have
puppies of bull-dogs and greyhound in salt, and I have had cart-horse
and race-horse young colts carefully measured. Whether I shall do any
good I doubt. I am getting out of my depth.

Most truly yours, C. DARWIN.


[An extract from a letter to Mr. Fox may find a place here, though of a
later date, viz. July, 1855]:

"Many thanks for the seven days' old white Dorking, and for the other
promised ones. I am getting quite a 'chamber of horrors,' I appreciate
your kindness even more than before; for I have done the black deed and
murdered an angelic little fantail and pouter at ten days old. I tried
chloroform and ether for the first, and though evidently a perfectly
easy death, it was prolonged; and for the second I tried putting lumps
of cyanide of potassium in a very large damp bottle, half an hour before
putting in the pigeon, and the prussic acid gas thus generated was very
quickly fatal."

A letter to Mr. Fox (May 23rd, 1855) gives the first mention of my
father's laborious piece of work on the breeding of pigeons:

"I write now to say that I have been looking at some of our mongrel
chickens, and I should say ONE WEEK OLD would do very well. The chief
points which I am, and have been for years, very curious about, is to
ascertain whether the YOUNG of our domestic breeds differ as much from
each other as do their parents, and I have no faith in anything short
of actual measurement and the Rule of Three. I hope and believe I am not
giving so much trouble without a motive of sufficient worth. I have got
my fantails and pouters (choice birds, I hope, as I paid 20 shillings
for each pair from Baily) in a grand cage and pigeon-house, and they are
a decided amusement to me, and delight to H."

In the course of my father's pigeon-fancying enterprise he necessarily
became acquainted with breeders, and was fond of relating his
experiences as a member of the Columbarian and Philoperistera Clubs,
where he met the purest enthusiasts of the "fancy," and learnt much
of the mysteries of their art. In writing to Mr. Huxley some years
afterwards, he quotes from a book on 'Pigeons' by Mr. J. Eaton, in
illustration of the "extreme attention and close observation" necessary
to be a good fancier.

"In his [Mr. Eaton's] treatise, devoted to the Almond Tumbler ALONE,
which is a sub-variety of the short-faced variety, which is a variety of
the Tumbler, as that is of the Rock-pigeon, Mr. Eaton says: 'There are
some of the young fanciers who are over-covetous, who go for all the
five properties at once [i.e., the five characteristic points which are
mainly attended to,--C.D.], they have their reward by getting nothing.'
In short, it is almost beyond the human intellect to attend to ALL the
excellencies of the Almond Tumbler!

"To be a good breeder, and to succeed in improving any breed, beyond
everything enthusiasm is required. Mr. Eaton has gained lots of prizes,
listen to him.

"'If it was possible for noblemen and gentlemen to know the amazing
amount of solace and pleasure derived from the Almond Tumbler, when they
begin to understand their (i.e., the tumbler's) properties, I should
think that scarce any nobleman or gentleman would be without their
aviaries of Almond Tumblers.'"

My father was fond of quoting this passage, and always with a tone of
fellow-feeling for the author, though, no doubt, he had forgotten
his own wonderings as a child that "every gentleman did not become an
ornithologist."--('Autobiography,' page 32.)

To Mr. W.B. Tegetmeier, the well-known writer on poultry, etc., he was
indebted for constant advice and co-operation. Their correspondence
began in 1855, and lasted to 1881, when my father wrote: "I can assure
you that I often look back with pleasure to the old days when I attended
to pigeons, fowls, etc., and when you gave me such valuable assistance.
I not rarely regret that I have had so little strength that I have not
been able to keep up old acquaintances and friendships." My father's
letters to Mr. Tegetmeier consist almost entirely of series of questions
relating to the different breeds of fowls, pigeons, etc., and are not,
therefore interesting. In reading through the pile of letters, one is
much struck by the diligence of the writer's search for facts, and it is
made clear that Mr. Tegetmeier's knowledge and judgment were completely
trusted and highly valued by him. Numerous phrases, such as "your note
is a mine of wealth to me," occur, expressing his sense of the value of
Mr. Tegetmeier's help, as well as words expressing his warm appreciation
of Mr. Tegetmeier's unstinting zeal and kindness, or his "pure and
disinterested love of science." On the subject of hive-bees and their
combs, Mr. Tegetmeier's help was also valued by my father, who wrote,
"your paper on 'Bees-cells,' read before the British Association, was
highly useful and suggestive to me."

To work out the problems on the Geographical Distributions of animals
and plants on evolutionary principles, he had to study the means by
which seeds, eggs, etc., can be transported across wide spaces of ocean.
It was this need which gave an interest to the class of experiment to
which the following letters allude.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, May 17th [1855].

My dear Fox,

You will hate the very sight of my hand-writing; but after this time I
promise I will ask for nothing more, at least for a long time. As you
live on sandy soil, have you lizards at all common? If you have, should
you think it too ridiculous to offer a reward for me for lizard's eggs
to the boys in your school; a shilling for every half-dozen, or more if
rare, till you got two or three dozen and send them to me? If snake's
eggs were brought in mistake it would be very well, for I want such
also; and we have neither lizards nor snakes about here. My object is
to see whether such eggs will float on sea water, and whether they will
keep alive thus floating for a month or two in my cellar. I am trying
experiments on transportation of all organic beings that I can; and
lizards are found on every island, and therefore I am very anxious to
see whether their eggs stand sea water. Of course this note need not be
answered, without, by a strange and favourable chance, you can some day
answer it with the eggs.

Your most troublesome friend, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. April 13th [1855].

...I have had one experiment some little time in progress, which will, I
think, be interesting, namely, seeds in salt water immersed in water of
32-33 degrees, which I have and shall long have, as I filled a great
tank with snow. When I wrote last I was going to triumph over you, for
my experiment had in a slight degree succeeded; but this, with infinite
baseness, I did not tell, in hopes that you would say that you would
eat all the plants which I could raise after immersion. It is very
aggravating that I cannot in the least remember what you did formerly
say that made me think you scoffed at the experiments vastly; for you
now seem to view the experiment like a good Christian. I have in small
bottles out of doors, exposed to variation of temperature, cress,
radish, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, and celery, and onion seed--four
great families. These, after immersion for exactly one week, have all
germinated, which I did not in the least expect (and thought how you
would sneer at me); for the water of nearly all, and of the cress
especially, smelt very badly, and the cress seed emitted a wonderful
quantity of mucus (the 'Vestiges' would have expected them to turn into
tadpoles), so as to adhere in a mass; but these seeds germinated and
grew splendidly. The germination of all (especially cress and lettuces)
has been accelerated, except the cabbages, which have come up very
irregularly, and a good many, I think, dead. One would have thought,
from their native habitat, that the cabbage would have stood well. The
Umbelliferae and onions seem to stand the salt well. I wash the seed
before planting them. I have written to the "Gardeners' Chronicle" (A
few words asking for information. The results were published in the
'Gardeners' Chronicle,' May 26, November 24, 1855. In the same year
(page 789) he sent a P.S. to his former paper, correcting a misprint and
adding a few words on the seeds of the Leguminosae. A fuller paper on
the germination of seeds after treatment in salt water, appeared in the
'Linnaean Soc. Journal,' 1857, page 130.), though I doubt whether it was
worth while. If my success seems to make it worth while, I will send a
seed list, to get you to mark some different classes of seeds. To-day I
replant the same seeds as above after fourteen days' immersion. As many
sea-currents go a mile an hour, even in a week they might be transported
168 miles; the Gulf Stream is said to go fifty and sixty miles a day. So
much and too much on this head; but my geese are always swans...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [April 14th, 1855.]

...You are a good man to confess that you expected the cress would be
killed in a week, for this gives me a nice little triumph. The children
at first were tremendously eager, and asked me often, "whether I should
beat Dr. Hooker!" The cress and lettuce have just vegetated well after
twenty-one days' immersion. But I will write no more, which is a
great virtue in me; for it is to me a very great pleasure telling you
everything I do.

...If you knew some of the experiments (if they may be so-called) which
I am trying, you would have a good right to sneer, for they are so
ABSURD even in MY opinion that I dare not tell you.

Have not some men a nice notion of experimentising? I have had a letter
telling me that seeds MUST have GREAT power of resisting salt water, for
otherwise how could they get to islands? This is the true way to solve a
problem!


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1855].

My dear Hooker,

You have been a very good man to exhale some of your satisfaction in
writing two notes to me; you could not have taken a better line in
my opinion; but as for showing your satisfaction in confounding my
experiments, I assure you I am quite enough confounded--those horrid
seeds, which, as you truly observe, if they sink they won't float.

I have written to Scoresby and have had a rather dry answer, but very
much to the purpose, and giving me no hopes of any law unknown to me
which might arrest their everlasting descent into the deepest depths of
the ocean. By the way it was very odd, but I talked to Col. Sabine for
half an hour on the subject, and could not make him see with respect to
transportal the difficulty of the sinking question! The bore is, if
the confounded seeds will sink, I have been taking all this trouble in
salting the ungrateful rascals for nothing.

Everything has been going wrong with me lately; the fish at the
Zoological Society ate up lots of soaked seeds, and in imagination
they had in my mind been swallowed, fish and all, by a heron, had been
carried a hundred miles, been voided on the banks of some other lake and
germinated splendidly, when lo and behold, the fish ejected vehemently,
and with disgust equal to my own, ALL the seeds from their mouths. (In
describing these troubles to Mr. Fox, my father wrote:--"All nature is
perverse and will not do as I wish it; and just at present I wish I had
my old barnacles to work at, and nothing new." The experiment ultimately
succeeded, and he wrote to Sir J. Hooker:--"I find fish will greedily
eat seeds of aquatic grasses, and that millet-seed put into fish and
given to a stork, and then voided, will germinate. So this is the
nursery rhyme of 'this is the stick that beats the pig,' etc., etc.,")

But I am not going to give up the floating yet: in first place I must
try fresh seeds, though of course it seems far more probable that they
will sink; and secondly, as a last resource, I must believe in the pod
or even whole plant or branch being washed into the sea; with floods and
slips and earthquakes; this must continually be happening, and if kept
wet, I fancy the pods, etc. etc., would not open and shed their seeds.
Do try your Mimosa seed at Kew.

I had intended to have asked you whether the Mimosa scandens and
Guilandina bonduc grows at Kew, to try fresh seeds. R. Brown tells me
he believes four W. Indian seeds have been washed on shores of Europe.
I was assured at Keeling Island that seeds were not rarely washed
on shore: so float they must and shall! What a long yarn I have been
spinning.

If you have several of the Loffoden seeds, do soak some in tepid water,
and get planted with the utmost care: this is an experiment after my own
heart, with chances 1000 to 1 against its success.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 11th [1855].

My dear Hooker,--I have just received your note. I am most sincerely
and heartily glad at the news (The appointment of Sir J.D. Hooker as
Assistant Director of the Royal Gardens at Kew.) it contains, and so is
my wife. Though the income is but a poor one, yet the certainty, I hope,
is satisfactory to yourself and Mrs. Hooker. As it must lead in future
years to the Directorship, I do hope you look at it, as a piece of good
fortune. For my own taste I cannot fancy a pleasanter position, than
the Head of such a noble and splendid place; far better, I should
think, than a Professorship in a great town. The more I think of it, the
gladder I am. But I will say no more; except that I hope Mrs. Hooker is
pretty well pleased...

As the "Gardeners' Chronicle" put in my question, and took notice of it,
I think I am bound to send, which I had thought of doing next week, my
first report to Lindley to give him the option of inserting it; but I
think it likely that he may not think it fit for a Gardening periodical.
When my experiments are ended (should the results appear worthy) and
should the 'Linnean Journal' not object to the previous publication of
imperfect and provisional reports, I should be DELIGHTED to insert the
final report there; for it has cost me so much trouble, that I should
think that probably the result was worthy of more permanent record than
a newspaper; but I think I am bound to send it first to Lindley.

I begin to think the floating question more serious than the germinating
one; and am making all the inquiries which I can on the subject, and
hope to get some little light on it...

I hope you managed a good meeting at the Club. The Treasurership must be
a plague to you, and I hope you will not be Treasurer for long: I know I
would much sooner give up the Club than be its Treasurer.

Farewell, Mr. Assistant Director and dear friend, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. June 5th, 1855.

...Miss Thorley (A lady who was for many years a governess in the
family.) and I are doing A LITTLE BOTANICAL WORK! for our amusement, and
it does amuse me very much, viz., making a collection of all the plants,
which grow in a field, which has been allowed to run waste for fifteen
years, but which before was cultivated from time immemorial; and we
are also collecting all the plants in an adjoining and SIMILAR but
cultivated field; just for the fun of seeing what plants have survived
or died out. Hereafter we shall want a bit of help in naming puzzlers.
How dreadfully difficult it is to name plants.

What a REMARKABLY nice and kind letter Dr. A. Gray has sent me in answer
to my troublesome queries; I retained your copy of his 'Manual' till I
heard from him, and when I have answered his letter, I will return it to
you.

I thank you much for Hedysarum: I do hope it is not very precious,
for as I told you it is for probably a MOST foolish purpose. I read
somewhere that no plant closes its leaves so promptly in darkness, and I
want to cover it up daily for half an hour, and see if I can teach it
to close by itself, or more easily than at first in darkness...I cannot
make out why you would prefer a continental transmission, as I think
you do, to carriage by sea. I should have thought you would have been
pleased at as many means of transmission as possible. For my own pet
theoretic notions, it is quite indifferent whether they are transmitted
by sea or land, as long as some tolerably probable way is shown. But it
shocks my philosophy to create land, without some other and independent
evidence. Whenever we meet, by a very few words I should, I think, more
clearly understand your views...

I have just made out my first grass, hurrah! hurrah! I must confess that
fortune favours the bold, for, as good luck would have it, it was the
easy Anthoxanthum odoratum: nevertheless it is a great discovery; I
never expected to make out a grass in all my life, so hurrah! It has
done my stomach surprising good...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [June?] 15th, [1855].

My dear Hooker,

I just write one line to say that the Hedysarum is come QUITE SAFELY,
and thank you for it.

You cannot imagine what amusement you have given me by naming those
three grasses: I have just got paper to dry and collect all grasses. If
ever you catch quite a beginner, and want to give him a taste of Botany,
tell him to make a perfect list of some little field or wood. Both Miss
Thorley and I agree that it gives a really uncommon interest to the
work, having a nice little definite world to work on, instead of the
awful abyss and immensity of all British Plants.

Adios. I was really consummately impudent to express my opinion "on the
retrograde step" ("To imagine such enormous geological changes within
the period of the existence of now living beings, on no other ground but
to account for their distribution, seems to me, in our present state
of ignorance on the means of transportal, an almost retrograde step
in science."--Extract from the paper on 'Salt Water and Seeds' in
"Gardeners' Chronicle", May 26, 1855.), and I deserved a good snub,
and upon reflection I am very glad you did not answer me in "Gardeners'
Chronicle".

I have been VERY MUCH interested with the Florula. (Godron's 'Florula
Juvenalis,' which gives an interesting account of plants introduced in
imported wool.)


[Writing on June 5th to Sir J.D. Hooker, my father mentions a letter
from Dr. Asa Gray. The letter referred to was an answer to the
following:]


CHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. (The well-known American Botanist. My
father's friendship with Dr. Gray began with the correspondence of which
the present is the first letter. An extract from a letter to Sir J.
Hooker, 1857, shows that my father's strong personal regard for Dr. Gray
had an early origin: "I have been glad to see A. Gray's letters; there
is always something in them that shows that he is a very lovable man.")
Down, April 25th [1855].

My dear Sir,

I hope that you will remember that I had the pleasure of being
introduced to you at Kew. I want to beg a great favour of you, for which
I well know I can offer no apology. But the favour will not, I think,
cause you much trouble, and will greatly oblige me. As I am no botanist,
it will seem so absurd to you my asking botanical questions; that I
may premise that I have for several years been collecting facts on
"variation," and when I find that any general remark seems to hold good
amongst animals, I try to test it in Plants. [Here follows a request for
information on American Alpine plants, and a suggestion as to publishing
on the subject.] I can assure you that I perceive how presumptuous it is
in me, not a botanist, to make even the most trifling suggestion to such
a botanist as yourself; but from what I saw and have heard of you from
our dear and kind friend Hooker, I hope and think you will forgive me,
and believe me, with much respect,

Dear sir, yours very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, June 8th [1855].

My dear Sir,

I thank you cordially for your remarkably kind letter of the 22d. ult.,
and for the extremely pleasant and obliging manner in which you have
taken my rather troublesome questions. I can hardly tell you how much
your list of Alpine plants has interested me, and I can now in some
degree picture to myself the plants of your Alpine summits. The new
edition of your Manual is CAPITAL news for me. I know from your preface
how pressed you are for room, but it would take no space to append (Eu)
in brackets to any European plant, and, as far as I am concerned,
this would answer every purpose. (This suggestion Dr. Gray adopted in
subsequent editions.) From my own experience, whilst making out English
plants in our manuals, it has often struck me how much interest it would
give if some notion of their range had been given; and so, I cannot
doubt, your American inquirers and beginners would much like to know
which of their plants were indigenous and which European. Would it not
be well in the Alpine plants to append the very same addition which you
have now sent me in MS.? though here, owing to your kindness, I do not
speak selfishly, but merely pro bono Americano publico. I presume it
would be too troublesome to give in your manual the habitats of those
plants found west of the Rocky Mountains, and likewise those found
in Eastern Asia, taking the Yenesei (?),--which, if I remember right,
according to Gmelin, is the main partition line of Siberia. Perhaps
Siberia more concerns the northern Flora of North America. The ranges of
plants to the east and west, viz., whether most found are in Greenland
and Western Europe, or in E. Asia, appears to me a very interesting
point as tending to show whether the migration has been eastward or
westward. Pray believe me that I am most entirely conscious that
the ONLY USE of these remarks is to show a botanist what points a
non-botanist is curious to learn; for I think every one who studies
profoundly a subject often becomes unaware [on] what points the ignorant
require information. I am so very glad that you think of drawing up
some notice on your geographical distribution, for the air of the Manual
strikes me as in some points better adapted for comparison with Europe
than that of the whole of North America. You ask me to state definitely
some of the points on which I much wish for information; but I really
hardly can, for they are so vague; and I rather wish to see what results
will come out from comparisons, than have as yet defined objects. I
presume that, like other botanists, you would give, for your area, the
proportion (leaving out introduced plants) to the whole of the great
leading families: this is one point I had intended (and, indeed, have
done roughly) to tabulate from your book, but of course I could
have done it only VERY IMPERFECTLY. I should also, of course, have
ascertained the proportion, to the whole Flora, of the European plants
(leaving out introduced) AND OF THE SEPARATE GREAT FAMILIES, in order to
speculate on means of transportal. By the way, I ventured to send a few
days ago a copy of the "Gardeners' Chronicle" with a short report by me
of some trifling experiments which I have been trying on the power of
seeds to withstand sea water. I do not know whether it has struck you,
but it has me, that it would be advisable for botanists to give in WHOLE
NUMBERS, as well as in the lowest fraction, the proportional numbers of
the families, thus I make out from your Manual that of the INDIGENOUS
plants the proportion of the Umbelliferae are 36/1798 = 1/49; for,
without one knows the WHOLE numbers, one cannot judge how really
close the numbers of the plants of the same family are in two distant
countries; but very likely you may think this superfluous. Mentioning
these proportional numbers, I may give you an instance of the sort of
points, and how vague and futile they often are, which I ATTEMPT to work
out...; reflecting on R. Brown's and Hooker's remark, that near identity
of proportional numbers of the great families in two countries, shows
probably that they were once continuously united, I thought I would
calculate the proportions of, for instance, the INTRODUCED Compositae in
Great Britain to all the introduced plants, and the result was, 10/92 =
1/9.2. In our ABORIGINAL or indigenous flora the proportion is 1/10; and
in many other cases I found an equally striking correspondence. I then
took your Manual, and worked out the same question; here I find in the
Compositae an almost equally striking correspondence, viz. 24/206 = 1/8
in the introduced plants, and 223/1798 = 1/8 in the indigenous; but when
I came to the other families I found the proportion entirely different,
showing that the coincidences in the British Flora were probably
accidental!

You will, I presume, give the proportion of the species to the genera,
i.e., show on an average how many species each genus contains; though I
have done this for myself.

If it would not be too troublesome, do you not think it would be very
interesting, and give a very good idea of your Flora, to divide the
species into three groups, viz., (a) species common to the old world,
stating numbers common to Europe and Asia; (b) indigenous species, but
belonging to genera found in the old world; and (c) species belonging
to genera confined to America or the New World. To make (according to my
ideas) perfection perfect, one ought to be told whether there are other
cases, like Erica, of genera common in Europe or in Old World not found
in your area. But honestly I feel that it is quite ridiculous my writing
to you at such length on the subject; but, as you have asked me, I do it
gratefully, and write to you as I should to Hooker, who often laughs at
me unmercifully, and I am sure you have better reason to do so.

There is one point on which I am MOST anxious for information, and I
mention it with the greatest hesitation, and only in the FULL BELIEF
that you will believe me that I have not the folly and presumption
to hope for a second that you will give it, without you can with very
little trouble. The point can at present interest no one but myself,
which makes the case wholly different from geographical distribution.
The only way in which, I think, you possibly could do it with little
trouble would be to bear in mind, whilst correcting your proof-sheets
of the Manual, my question and put a cross or mark to the species, and
whenever sending a parcel to Hooker to let me have such old sheets. But
this would give you the trouble of remembering my question, and I can
hardly hope or expect that you will do it. But I will just mention what
I want; it is to have marked the "close species" in a Flora, so as
to compare in DIFFERENT Floras whether the same genera have "close
species," and for other purposes too vague to enumerate. I have
attempted, by Hooker's help, to ascertain in a similar way whether the
different species of the same genera in distant quarters of the globe
are variable or present varieties. The definition I should give of a
"CLOSE SPECIES" was one that YOU thought specifically distinct, but
which you could conceive some other GOOD botanist might think only
a race or variety; or, again, a species that you had trouble, though
having opportunities of knowing it well, in discriminating from some
other species. Supposing that you were inclined to be so very kind as
to do this, and could (which I do not expect) spare the time, as I have
said, a mere cross to each such species in any useless proof-sheets
would give me the information desired, which, I may add, I know must be
vague.

How can I apologise enough for all my presumption and the extreme length
of this letter? The great good nature of your letter to me has been
partly the cause, so that, as is too often the case in this world, you
are punished for your good deeds. With hearty thanks, believe me,

Yours very truly and gratefully, CH. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 18th [July, 1855].

...I think I am getting a MILD case about Charlock seed (In the
"Gardeners' Chronicle", 1855, page 758, appeared a notice (half a column
in length) by my father on the "Vitality of Seeds." The facts related
refer to the "Sand-walk"; the wood was planted in 1846 on a piece of
pasture land laid down as grass in 1840. In 1855, on the soil being dug
in several places, Charlock (Brassica sinapistrum) sprang up freely.
The subject continued to interest him, and I find a note dated July
2nd, 1874, in which my father recorded that forty-six plants of Charlock
sprang up in that year over a space (14 x 7 feet) which had been dug
to a considerable depth.); but just as about salting, ill-luck to it, I
cannot remember how many years you would allow that Charlock seed might
live in the ground. Next time you write, show a bold face, and say in
how many years, you think, Charlock seed would probably all be dead. A
man told me the other day of, as I thought, a splendid instance,--and
SPLENDID it was, for according to his evidence the seed came up alive
out of the LOWER PART of the LONDON CLAY!! I disgusted him by telling
him that Palms ought to have come up.

You ask how far I go in attributing organisms to a common descent; I
answer I know not; the way in which I intend treating the subject, is
to show (AS FAR AS I CAN) the facts and arguments for and against the
common descent of the species of the same genus; and then show how
far the same arguments tell for or against forms, more and more widely
different: and when we come to forms of different orders and classes,
there remain only some such arguments as those which can perhaps be
deduced from similar rudimentary structures, and very soon not an
argument is left.


[The following extract from a letter to Mr. Fox [October, 1855 (In this
year he published ('Phil. Mag.' x.) a paper 'On the power of icebergs
to make rectilinear uniformly-directed grooves across a submarine
undulatory surface.'") gives a brief mention of the last meeting of the
British Association which he attended:] "I really have no news: the
only thing we have done for a long time, was to go to Glasgow; but the
fatigue was to me more than it was worth, and E. caught a bad cold. On
our return we stayed a single day at Shrewsbury, and enjoyed seeing the
old place. I saw a little of Sir Philip (Sir P. Egerton was a neighbour
of Mr. Fox.) (whom I liked much), and he asked me "why on earth I
instigated you to rob his poultry-yard?' The meeting was a good one, and
the Duke of Argyll spoke excellently."]




CHAPTER 1.XII. -- THE UNFINISHED BOOK.

MAY 1856 TO JUNE 1858.

[In the Autobiographical chapter (page 69,) my father wrote:--"Early in
1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and I began at
once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as that which
was afterwards followed in my 'Origin of Species;' yet it was only an
abstract of the materials which I had collected." The letters in the
present chapter are chiefly concerned with the preparation of this
unfinished book.

The work was begun on May 14th, and steadily continued up to June 1858,
when it was interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Wallace's MS. During the
two years which we are now considering he wrote ten chapters (that is
about one-half) of the projected book. He remained for the most part at
home, but paid several visits to Dr. Lane's Water-Cure Establishment
at Moor Park, during one of which he made a pilgrimage to the shrine of
Gilbert White at Selborne.]


LETTERS.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL May 3 [1856].

...With respect to your suggestion of a sketch of my views, I hardly
know what to think, but will reflect on it, but it goes against my
prejudices. To give a fair sketch would be absolutely impossible, for
every proposition requires such an array of facts. If I were
to do anything, it could only refer to the main agency of
change--selection--and perhaps point out a very few of the leading
features, which countenance such a view, and some few of the main
difficulties. But I do not know what to think; I rather hate the idea of
writing for priority, yet I certainly should be vexed if any one were
to publish my doctrines before me. Anyhow, I thank you heartily for
your sympathy. I shall be in London next week, and I will call on you on
Thursday morning for one hour precisely, so as not to lose much of
your time and my own; but will you let me this time come as early as 9
o'clock, for I have much which I must do in the morning in my strongest
time? Farewell, my dear old patron.

Yours, C. DARWIN.

By the way, THREE plants have come up out of the earth, perfectly
enclosed in the roots of the trees. And twenty-nine plants in the
table-spoonful of mud, out of the little pond; Hooker was surprised at
this, and struck with it, when I showed him how much mud I had scraped
off one duck's feet.

If I did publish a short sketch, where on earth should I publish it?

If I do NOT hear, I shall understand that I may come from 9 to 10 on
Thursday.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. May 9th, [1856].

...I very much want advice and TRUTHFUL consolation if you can give
it. I had a good talk with Lyell about my species work, and he urges
me strongly to publish something. I am fixed against any periodical
or Journal, as I positively will NOT expose myself to an Editor or a
Council, allowing a publication for which they might be abused. If I
publish anything it must be a VERY THIN and little volume, giving
a sketch of my views and difficulties; but it is really dreadfully
unphilosophical to give a resume, without exact references, of an
unpublished work. But Lyell seemed to think I might do this, at the
suggestion of friends, and on the ground, which I might state, that I
had been at work for eighteen (The interval of eighteen years, from 1837
when he began to collect facts, would bring the date of this letter to
1855, not 1856, nevertheless the latter seems the more probable date.)
years, and yet could not publish for several years, and especially as
I could point out difficulties which seemed to me to require especial
investigation. Now what think you? I should be really grateful for
advice. I thought of giving up a couple of months and writing such a
sketch, and trying to keep my judgment open whether or no to publish
it when completed. It will be simply impossible for me to give exact
references; anything important I should state on the authority of the
author generally; and instead of giving all the facts on which I ground
my opinion, I could give by memory only one or two. In the Preface I
would state that the work could not be considered strictly scientific,
but a mere sketch or outline of a future work in which full references,
etc. should be given. Eheu, eheu, I believe I should sneer at any one
else doing this, and my only comfort is, that I TRULY never dreamed
of it, till Lyell suggested it, and seems deliberately to think it
advisable.

I am in a peck of troubles and do pray forgive me for troubling you.

Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. May 11th [1856].

...Now for a MORE IMPORTANT! subject, viz., my own self: I am extremely
glad you think well of a separate "Preliminary Essay" (i.e., if anything
whatever is published; for Lyell seemed rather to doubt on this head)
(The meaning of the sentence in parentheses is obscure.); but I cannot
bear the idea of BEGGING some Editor and Council to publish, and then
perhaps to have to APOLOGISE humbly for having led them into a scrape.
In this one respect I am in the state which, according to a very wise
saying of my father's, is the only fit state for asking advice, viz.,
with my mind firmly made up, and then, as my father used to say, GOOD
advice was very comfortable, and it was easy to reject BAD advice. But
Heaven knows I am not in this state with respect to publishing at all
any preliminary essay. It yet strikes me as quite unphilosophical
to publish results without the full details which have lead to such
results.

It is a melancholy, and I hope not quite true view of yours that facts
will prove anything, and are therefore superfluous! But I have rather
exaggerated, I see, your doctrine. I do not fear being tied down
to error, i.e., I feel pretty sure I should give up anything false
published in the preliminary essay, in my larger work; but I may thus,
it is very true, do mischief by spreading error, which as I have often
heard you say is much easier spread than corrected. I confess I lean
more and more to at least making the attempt and drawing up a sketch
and trying to keep my judgment, whether to publish, open. But I always
return to my fixed idea that it is dreadfully unphilosophical to publish
without full details. I certainly think my future work in full would
profit by hearing what my friends or critics (if reviewed) thought of
the outline.

To any one but you I should apologise for such long discussion on so
personal an affair; but I believe, and indeed you have proved it by the
trouble you have taken, that this would be superfluous.

Yours truly obliged, CH. DARWIN.

P.S. What you say (for I have just re-read your letter) that the Essay
might supersede and take away all novelty and value from any future
larger Book, is very true; and that would grieve me beyond everything.
On the other hand (again from Lyell's urgent advice), I published a
preliminary sketch of the Coral Theory, and this did neither good nor
harm. I begin MOST HEARTILY to wish that Lyell had never put this idea
of an Essay into my head.


FROM A LETTER TO SIR C. LYELL [July, 1856].

"I am delighted that I may say (with absolute truth) that my essay
is published at your suggestion, but I hope it will not need so much
apology as I at first thought; for I have resolved to make it nearly as
complete as my present materials allow. I cannot put in all which you
suggest, for it would appear too conceited."


FROM A LETTER TO W.D. FOX. Down, June 14th [1856].

"...What you say about my Essay, I dare say is very true; and it gave me
another fit of the wibber-gibbers: I hope that I shall succeed in making
it modest. One great motive is to get information on the many points
on which I want it. But I tremble about it, which I should not do, if
I allowed some three or four more years to elapse before publishing
anything..."


[The following extracts from letters to Mr. Fox are worth giving, as
showing how great was the accumulation of material which now had to be
dealt with.

June 14th [1856].

"Very many thanks for the capital information on cats; I see I had
blundered greatly, but I know I had somewhere your original notes; but
my notes are so numerous during nineteen years' collection, that it
would take me at least a year to go over and classify them."

November 1856.

"Sometimes I fear I shall break down, for my subject gets bigger and
bigger with each month's work."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL Down, 16th [June, 1856].

My dear Lyell,

I am going to do the most impudent thing in the world. But my blood gets
hot with passion and turns cold alternately at the geological strides,
which many of your disciples are taking.

Here, poor Forbes made a continent to [i.e., extending to] North America
and another (or the same) to the Gulf weed; Hooker makes one from New
Zealand to South America and round the World to Kerguelen Land. Here
is Wollaston speaking of Madeira and P. Santo "as the sure and certain
witnesses of a former continent." Here is Woodward writes to me, if you
grant a continent over 200 or 300 miles of ocean depths (as if that was
nothing), why not extend a continent to every island in the Pacific and
Atlantic Oceans? And all this within the existence of recent species! If
you do not stop this, if there be a lower region for the punishment of
geologists, I believe, my great master, you will go there. Why, your
disciples in a slow and creeping manner beat all the old Catastrophists
who ever lived. You will live to be the great chief of the
Catastrophists.

There, I have done myself a great deal of good, and have exploded my
passion.

So my master, forgive me, and believe me, ever yours, C. DARWIN.

P.S. Don't answer this, I did it to ease myself.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [June] 17th, 1856.

...I have been very deeply interested by Wollaston's book ('The
Variation of Species,' 1856.), though I differ GREATLY from many of his
doctrines. Did you ever read anything so rich, considering how very
far he goes, as his denunciations against those who go further: "Most
mischievous," "absurd," "unsound." Theology is at the bottom of some
of this. I told him he was like Calvin burning a heretic. It is a very
valuable and clever book in my opinion. He has evidently read very
little out of his own line. I urged him to read the New Zealand essay.
His Geology also is rather eocene, as I told him. In fact I wrote most
frankly; he says he is sure that ultra-honesty is my characteristic:
I do not know whether he meant it as a sneer; I hope not. Talking
of eocene geology, I got so wrath about the Atlantic continent, more
especially from a note from Woodward (who has published a capital book
on shells), who does not seem to doubt that every island in the Pacific
and Atlantic are the remains of continents, submerged within period of
existing species, that I fairly exploded, and wrote to Lyell to protest,
and summed up all the continents created of late years by Forbes (the
head sinner!) YOURSELF, Wollaston, and Woodward, and a pretty nice
little extension of land they make altogether! I am fairly rabid on the
question and therefore, if not wrong already, am pretty sure to become
so...

I have enjoyed your note much. Adios, C. DARWIN.

P.S. [June] 18th. Lyell has written me a CAPITAL letter on your side,
which ought to upset me entirely, but I cannot say it does quite.

Though I must try and cease being rabid and try to feel humble, and
allow you all to make continents, as easily as a cook does pancakes.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, June 25th [1856].

My dear Lyell,

I will have the following tremendous letter copied to make the reading
easier, and as I want to keep a copy.

As you say you would like to hear my reasons for being most unwilling
to believe in the continental extensions of late authors, I gladly write
them, as, without I am convinced of my error, I shall have to give them
condensed in my essay, when I discuss single and multiple creation; I
shall therefore be particularly glad to have your general opinion on
them. I may QUITE LIKELY have persuaded myself in my wrath that there
is more in them than there is. If there was much more reason to admit a
continental extension in any one or two instances (as in Madeira) than
in other cases, I should feel no difficulty whatever. But if on account
of European plants, and littoral sea shells, it is thought necessary to
join Madeira to the mainland, Hooker is quite right to join New Holland
to New Zealand, and Auckland Island (and Raoul Island to N.E.), and
these to S. America and the Falklands, and these to Tristan d'Acunha,
and these to Kerguelen Land; thus making, either strictly at the same
time, or at different periods, but all within the life of recent
beings, an almost circumpolar belt of land. So again Galapagos and Juan
Fernandez must be joined to America; and if we trust to littoral see
shells, the Galapagos must have been joined to the Pacific Islands (2400
miles distant) as well as to America, and as Woodward seems to think
all the islands in the Pacific into a magnificent continent; also
the islands in the Southern Indian Ocean into another continent, with
Madagascar and Africa, and perhaps India. In the North Atlantic, Europe
will stretch half-way across the ocean to the Azores, and further north
right across. In short, we must suppose probably, half the present ocean
was land within the period of living organisms. The Globe within this
period must have had a quite different aspect. Now the only way to
test this, that I can see, is to consider whether the continents have
undergone within this same period such wonderful permutations. In all
North and South and Central America, we have both recent and miocene (or
eocene) shells, quite distinct on the opposite sides, and hence I cannot
doubt that FUNDAMENTALLY America has held its place since at least, the
miocene period. In Africa almost all the living shells are distinct on
the opposite sides of the inter-tropical regions, short as the distance
is compared to the range of marine mollusca, in uninterrupted seas;
hence I infer that Africa has existed since our present species were
created. Even the isthmus of Suez and the Aralo-Caspian basin have had a
great antiquity. So I imagine, from the tertiary deposits, has India.
In Australia the great fauna of extinct marsupials shows that before the
present mammals appeared, Australia was a separate continent. I do not
for one second doubt that very large portions of all these continents
have undergone GREAT changes of level within this period, but yet I
conclude that fundamentally they stood as barriers in the sea, where
they now stand; and therefore I should require the weightiest evidence
to make me believe in such immense changes within the period of living
organisms in our oceans, where, moreover, from the great depths, the
changes must have been vaster in a vertical sense.

SECONDLY.

Submerge our present continents, leaving a few mountain peaks as
islands, and what will the character of the islands be,--Consider
that the Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada, Apennines, Alps, Carpathians, are
non-volcanic, Etna and Caucasus, volcanic. In Asia, Altai and Himalaya,
I believe non-volcanic. In North Africa the non-volcanic, as I imagine,
Alps of Abyssinia and of the Atlas. In South Africa, the Snow Mountains.
In Australia, the non-volcanic Alps. In North America, the White
Mountains, Alleghanies and Rocky Mountains--some of the latter alone,
I believe, volcanic. In South America to the east, the non-volcanic
[Silla?] of Caracas, and Itacolumi of Brazil, further south the Sierra
Ventanas, and in the Cordilleras, many volcanic but not all. Now compare
these peaks with the oceanic islands; as far as known all are volcanic,
except St. Paul's (a strange bedevilled rock), and the Seychelles,
if this latter can be called oceanic, in the line of Madagascar; the
Falklands, only 500 miles off, are only a shallow bank; New Caledonia,
hardly oceanic, is another exception. This argument has to me great
weight. Compare on a Geographical map, islands which, we have SEVERAL
reasons to suppose, were connected with mainland, as Sardinia, and how
different it appears. Believing, as I am inclined, that continents as
continents, and oceans as oceans, are of immense antiquity--I should
say that if any of the existing oceanic islands have any relation of any
kind to continents, they are forming continents; and that by the time
they could form a continent, the volcanoes would be denuded to their
cores, leaving peaks of syenite, diorite, or porphyry. But have we
nowhere any last wreck of a continent, in the midst of the ocean? St.
Paul's Rock, and such old battered volcanic islands, as St. Helena, may
be; but I think we can see some reason why we should have less evidence
of sinking than of rising continents (if my view in my Coral volume has
any truth in it, viz.: that volcanic outbursts accompany rising areas),
for during subsidence there will be no compensating agent at work, in
rising areas there will be the ADDITIONAL element of outpoured volcanic
matter.

THIRDLY.

Considering the depth of the ocean, I was, before I got your letter,
inclined vehemently to dispute the vast amount of subsidence, but I
must strike my colours. With respect to coral reefs, I carefully guarded
against its being supposed that a continent was indicated by the groups
of atolls. It is difficult to guess, as it seems to me, the amount of
subsidence indicated by coral reefs; but in such large areas as the Lowe
Archipelago, the Marshall Archipelago, and Laccadive group, it would,
judging, from the heights of existing oceanic archipelagoes, be odd, if
some peaks of from 8000 to 10,000 feet had not been buried. Even after
your letter a suspicion crossed me whether it would be fair to argue
from subsidences in the middle of the greatest oceans to continents; but
refreshing my memory by talking with Ramsay in regard to the probable
thickness in one vertical line of the Silurian and carboniferous
formation, it seems there must have been AT LEAST 10,000 feet of
subsidence during these formations in Europe and North America, and
therefore during the continuance of nearly the same set of organic
beings. But even 12,000 feet would not be enough for the Azores, or
for Hooker's continent; I believe Hooker does not infer a continuous
continent, but approximate groups of islands, with, if we may judge
from existing continents, not PROFOUNDLY deep sea between them; but
the argument from the volcanic nature of nearly every existing oceanic
island tell against such supposed groups of islands,--for I presume he
does not suppose a mere chain of volcanic islands belting the southern
hemisphere.

FOURTHLY.

The supposed continental extensions do not seem to me, perfectly to
account for all the phenomena of distribution on islands; as the absence
of mammals and Batrachians; the absence of certain great groups of
insects on Madeira, and of Acaciae and Banksias, etc., in New Zealand;
the paucity of plants in some cases, etc. Not that those who believe in
various accidental means of dispersal, can explain most of these cases;
but they may at least say that these facts seem hardly compatible with
former continuous land.

FINALLY.

For these several reasons, and especially considering it certain
(in which you will agree) that we are extremely ignorant of means of
dispersal, I cannot avoid thinking that Forbes' 'Atlantis,' was
an ill-service to science, as checking a close study of means of
dissemination. I shall be really grateful to hear, as briefly as you
like, whether these arguments have any weight with you, putting yourself
in the position of an honest judge. I told Hooker that I was going to
write to you on this subject; and I should like him to read this; but
whether he or you will think it worth time and postage remains to be
proved.

Yours most truly, CHARLES DARWIN.


[On July 8th he wrote to Sir Charles Lyell.

"I am sorry you cannot give any verdict on Continental extensions; and
I infer that you think my argument of not much weight against such
extensions. I know I wish I could believe so."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, July 20th [1856].

...It is not a little egotistical, but I should like to tell you (and
I do not THINK I have) how I view my work. Nineteen years (!) ago it
occurred to me that whilst otherwise employed on Natural History,
I might perhaps do good if I noted any sort of facts bearing on the
question of the origin of species, and this I have since been doing.
Either species have been independently created, or they have descended
from other species, like varieties from one species. I think it can
be shown to be probable that man gets his most distinct varieties by
preserving such as arise best worth keeping and destroying the others,
but I should fill a quire if I were to go on. To be brief, I ASSUME that
species arise like our domestic varieties with MUCH extinction; and
then test this hypothesis by comparison with as many general and pretty
well-established propositions as I can find made out,--in geographical
distribution, geological history, affinities, etc., etc. And it seems
to me that, SUPPOSING that such hypothesis were to explain such general
propositions, we ought, in accordance with the common way of following
all sciences, to admit it till some better hypothesis be found out. For
to my mind to say that species were created so and so is no scientific
explanation, only a reverent way of saying it is so and so. But it is
nonsensical trying to show how I try to proceed in the compass of a
note. But as an honest man, I must tell you that I have come to the
heterodox conclusion that there are no such things as independently
created species--that species are only strongly defined varieties. I
know that this will make you despise me. I do not much underrate the
many HUGE difficulties on this view, but yet it seems to me to explain
too much, otherwise inexplicable, to be false. Just to allude to one
point in your last note, viz., about species of the same genus
GENERALLY having a common or continuous area; if they are actual lineal
descendants of one species, this of course would be the case; and the
sadly too many exceptions (for me) have to be explained by climatal
and geological changes. A fortiori on this view (but on exactly
same grounds), all the individuals of the same species should have a
continuous distribution. On this latter branch of the subject I have
put a chapter together, and Hooker kindly read it over. I thought the
exceptions and difficulties were so great that on the whole the balance
weighed against my notions, but I was much pleased to find that it
seemed to have considerable weight with Hooker, who said he had never
been so much staggered about the permanence of species.

I must say one word more in justification (for I feel sure that your
tendency will be to despise me and my crotchets), that all my notions
about HOW species change are derived from long continued study of the
works of (and converse with) agriculturists and horticulturists; and
I believe I see my way pretty clearly on the means used by nature
to change her species and ADAPT them to the wondrous and exquisitely
beautiful contingencies to which every living being is exposed...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 30th 1856.

My dear Hooker,

Your letter is of MUCH value to me. I was not able to get a definite
answer from Lyell (On the continental extensions of Forbes and others.),
as you will see in the enclosed letters, though I inferred that
he thought nothing of my arguments. Had it not been for this
correspondence, I should have written sadly too strongly. You may
rely on it I shall put my doubts moderately. There never was such a
predicament as mine: here you continental extensionists would remove
enormous difficulties opposed to me, and yet I cannot honestly admit the
doctrine, and must therefore say so. I cannot get over the fact that not
a fragment of secondary or palaeozoic rock has been found on any island
above 500 or 600 miles from a mainland. You rather misunderstand me
when you think I doubt the POSSIBILITY of subsidence of 20,000 or 30,000
feet; it is only probability, considering such evidence as we have
independently of distribution. I have not yet worked out in full detail
the distribution of mammalia, both IDENTICAL and allied, with respect
to the ONE ELEMENT OF DEPTH OF THE SEA; but as far as I have gone, the
results are to me surprisingly accordant with my very most troublesome
belief in not such great geographical changes as you believe; and in
mammalia we certainly know more of MEANS of distribution than in any
other class. Nothing is so vexatious to me, as so constantly finding
myself drawing different conclusions from better judges than myself,
from the same facts.

I fancy I have lately removed many (not geographical) great difficulties
opposed to my notions, but God knows it may be all hallucination.

Please return Lyell's letters.

What a capital letter of Lyell's that to you is, and what a wonderful
man he is. I differ from him greatly in thinking that those who believe
that species are NOT fixed will multiply specific names: I know in my
own case my most frequent source of doubt was whether others would not
think this or that was a God-created Barnacle, and surely deserved
a name. Otherwise I should only have thought whether the amount of
difference and permanence was sufficient to justify a name: I am, also,
surprised at his thinking it immaterial whether species are absolute or
not: whenever it is proved that all species are produced by generation,
by laws of change, what good evidence we shall have of the gaps in
formations. And what a science Natural History will be, when we are
in our graves, when all the laws of change are thought one of the most
important parts of Natural History.

I cannot conceive why Lyell thinks such notions as mine or of
'Vestiges,' will invalidate specific centres. But I must not run on
and take up your time. My MS. will not, I fear, be copied before you go
abroad. With hearty thanks.

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--After giving much condensed, my argument versus continental
extensions, I shall append some such sentence, as that two better judges
than myself have considered these arguments, and attach no weight to
them.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 5th [1856].

...I quite agree about Lyell's letters to me, which, though to me
interesting, have afforded me no new light. Your letters, under the
GEOLOGICAL point of view, have been more valuable to me. You cannot
imagine how earnestly I wish I could swallow continental extension,
but I cannot; the more I think (and I cannot get the subject out of my
head), the more difficult I find it. If there were only some half-dozen
cases, I should not feel the least difficulty; but the generality of the
facts of all islands (except one or two) having a considerable part of
their productions in common with one or more mainlands utterly staggers
me. What a wonderful case of the Epacridae! It is most vexatious, also
humiliating, to me that I cannot follow and subscribe to the way in
which you strikingly put your view of the case. I look at your facts
(about Eucalyptus, etc.) as DAMNING against continental extension, and
if you like also damning against migration, or at least of ENORMOUS
difficulty. I see the ground of our difference (in a letter I must put
myself on an equality in arguing) lies, in my opinion, that scarcely
anything is known of means of distribution. I quite agree with A. De
Candolle's (and I dare say your) opinion that it is poor work putting
together the merely POSSIBLE means of distribution; but I see no
other way in which the subject can be attacked, for I think that A. De
Candolle's argument, that no plants have been introduced into England
except by man's agency, [is] of no weight. I cannot but think that the
theory of continental extension does do some little harm as stopping
investigation of the means of dispersal, which, whether NEGATIVE or
positive, seems to me of value; when negatived, then every one who
believes in single centres will have to admit continental extensions.

...I see from your remarks that you do not understand my notions
(whether or no worth anything) about modification; I attribute very
little to the direct action of climate, etc. I suppose, in regard to
specific centres, we are at cross purposes; I should call the kitchen
garden in which the red cabbage was produced, or the farm in which
Bakewell made the Shorthorn cattle, the specific centre of these
SPECIES! And surely this is centralisation enough!

I thank you most sincerely for all your assistance; and whether or no my
book may be wretched, you have done your best to make it less wretched.
Sometimes I am in very good spirits and sometimes very low about it. My
own mind is decided on the question of the origin of species; but, good
heavens, how little that is worth!...

[With regard to "specific centres," a passage from a letter dated July
25, 1856, by Sir Charles Lyell to Sir J.D. Hooker ('Life' ii. page 216)
is of interest:

"I fear much that if Darwin argues that species are phantoms, he will
also have to admit that single centres of dispersion are phantoms also,
and that would deprive me of much of the value which I ascribe to the
present provinces of animals and plants, as illustrating modern and
tertiary changes in physical geography."

He seems to have recognised, however, that the phantom doctrine would
soon have to be faced, for he wrote in the same letter: "Whether Darwin
persuades you and me to renounce our faith in species (when geological
epochs are considered) or not, I foresee that many will go over to the
indefinite modifiability doctrine."


In the autumn my father was still working at geographical distribution,
and again sought the aid of Sir J.D. Hooker.

A LETTER TO SIR J.D. HOOKER [September, 1856].

"In the course of some weeks, you unfortunate wretch, you will have my
MS. on one point of Geographical Distribution. I will however, never ask
such a favour again; but in regard to this one piece of MS., it is of
infinite importance to me for you to see it; for never in my life have
I felt such difficulty what to do, and I heartily wish I could slur the
whole subject over."

In a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker (June, 1856), the following
characteristic passage occurs, suggested, no doubt, by the kind of work
which his chapter on Geographical Distribution entailed:

"There is wonderful ill logic in his [E. Forbes'] famous and admirable
memoir on distribution, as it appears to me, now that I have got it up
so as to give the heads in a page. Depend on it, my saying is a true
one, viz., that a compiler is a GREAT man, and an original man a
commonplace man. Any fool can generalise and speculate; but, oh, my
heavens! To get up AT SECOND HAND a New Zealand Flora, that is work."


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. October 3 [1856].

...I remember you protested against Lyell's advice of writing a
SKETCH of my species doctrines. Well, when I began I found it such
unsatisfactory work that I have desisted, and am now drawing up my work
as perfect as my materials of nineteen years' collecting suffice, but do
not intend to stop to perfect any line of investigation beyond current
work. Thus far and no farther I shall follow Lyell's urgent advice. Your
remarks weighed with me considerably. I find to my sorrow it will run
to quite a big book. I have found my careful work at pigeons really
invaluable, as enlightening me on many points on variation under
domestication. The copious old literature, by which I can trace the
gradual changes in the breeds of pigeons has been extraordinarily useful
to me. I have just had pigeons and fowls ALIVE from the Gambia! Rabbits
and ducks I am attending to pretty carefully, but less so than pigeons.
I find most remarkable differences in the skeletons of rabbits. Have you
ever kept any odd breeds of rabbits, and can you give me any details?
One other question: You used to keep hawks; do you at all know, after
eating a bird, how soon after they throw up the pellet?

No subject gives me so much trouble and doubt and difficulty as the
means of dispersal of the same species of terrestrial productions on
the oceanic islands. Land mollusca drive me mad, and I cannot anyhow get
their eggs to experimentise their power of floating and resistance to
the injurious action of salt water. I will not apologise for writing
so much about my own doings, as I believe you will like to hear. Do
sometime, I beg you, let me hear how you get on in health; and IF SO
INCLINED, let me have some words on call-ducks.

My dear Fox, yours affectionately, CH. DARWIN.


[With regard to his book he wrote (November 10th) to Sir Charles Lyell]:

"I am working very steadily at my big book; I have found it quite
impossible to publish any preliminary essay or sketch; but am doing
my work as completely as my present materials allow without waiting to
perfect them. And this much acceleration I owe to you."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Sunday [October 1856].

My dear Hooker,

The seeds are come all safe, many thanks for them. I was very sorry to
run away so soon and miss any part of my MOST pleasant evening; and I
ran away like a Goth and Vandal without wishing Mrs. Hooker good-bye;
but I was only just in time, as I got on the platform the train had
arrived.

I was particularly glad of our discussion after dinner, fighting a
battle with you always clears my mind wonderfully. I groan to hear that
A. Gray agrees with you about the condition of Botanical Geography.
All I know is that if you had had to search for light in Zoological
Geography you would by contrast, respect your own subject a vast deal
more than you now do. The hawks have behaved like gentlemen, and have
cast up pellets with lots of seeds in them; and I have just had a parcel
of partridge's feet well caked with mud!!! (The mud in such cases often
contains seeds, so that plants are thus transported.) Adios.

Your insane and perverse friend, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 4th [1856].

My dear Hooker,

I thank you more CORDIALLY than you will think probable, for your note.
Your verdict (On the MS. relating to geographical distribution.) has
been a great relief. On my honour I had no idea whether or not you would
say it was (and I knew you would say it very kindly) so bad, that you
would have begged me to have burnt the whole. To my own mind my MS.
relieved me of some few difficulties, and the difficulties seemed to me
pretty fairly stated, but I had become so bewildered with conflicting
facts, evidence, reasoning and opinions, that I felt to myself that
I had lost all judgment. Your general verdict is INCOMPARABLY more
favourable than I had anticipated...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 23rd [1856].

My dear Hooker,

I fear I shall weary you with letters, but do not answer this, for in
truth and without flattery, I so value your letters, that after a heavy
batch, as of late, I feel that I have been extravagant and have drawn
too much money, and shall therefore have to stint myself on another
occasion.

When I sent my MS. I felt strongly that some preliminary questions on
the causes of variation ought to have been sent you. Whether I am
right or wrong in these points is quite a separate question, but the
conclusion which I have come to, quite independently of geographical
distribution, is that external conditions (to which naturalists so often
appeal) do by themselves VERY LITTLE. How much they do is the point of
all others on which I feel myself very weak. I judge from the facts
of variation under domestication, and I may yet get more light. But at
present, after drawing up a rough copy on this subject, my conclusion
is that external conditions do EXTREMELY little, except in causing mere
variability. This mere variability (causing the child NOT closely to
resemble its parent) I look at as VERY different from the formation of a
marked variety or new species. (No doubt the variability is governed
by laws, some of which I am endeavouring very obscurely to trace.) The
formation of a strong variety or species I look a as almost wholly due
to the selection of what may be incorrectly called CHANCE variations or
variability. This power of selection stands in the most direct relation
to time, and in the state of nature can be only excessively slow. Again,
the slight differences selected, by which a race or species is at last
formed, stands, as I think can be shown (even with plants, and obviously
with animals), in a far more important relation to its associates than
to external conditions. Therefore, according to my principles, whether
right or wrong, I cannot agree with your proposition that time, and
altered conditions, and altered associates, are 'convertible terms.'
I look at the first and the last as FAR more important: time being
important only so far as giving scope to selection. God knows whether
you will perceive at what I am driving. I shall have to discuss and
think more about your difficulty of the temperate and sub-arctic forms
in the S. hemisphere than I have yet done. But I am inclined to think
that I am right (if my general principles are right), that there would
be little tendency to the formation of a new species, during the period
of migration, whether shorter or longer, though considerable variability
may have supervened...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. December 24th [1856].

...How I do wish I lived near you to discuss matters with. I have
just been comparing definitions of species, and stating briefly how
systematic naturalists work out their subjects. Aquilegia in the Flora
Indica was a capital example for me. It is really laughable to see what
different ideas are prominent in various naturalists' minds, when they
speak of "species;" in some, resemblance is everything and descent
of little weight--in some, resemblance seems to go for nothing, and
Creation the reigning idea--in some, descent is the key,--in some,
sterility an unfailing test, with others it is not worth a farthing. It
all comes, I believe, from trying to define the undefinable. I
suppose you have lost the odd black seed from the birds' dung, which
germinated,--anyhow, it is not worth taking trouble over. I have now got
about a dozen seeds out of small birds' dung. Adios,

My dear Hooker, ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, January 1st [1857?].

My dear Dr Gray,

I have received the second part of your paper ('Statistics of the Flora
of the Northern United States.' "Silliman's Journal", 1857.), and though
I have nothing particular to say, I must send you my thanks and hearty
admiration. The whole paper strikes me as quite exhausting the subject,
and I quite fancy and flatter myself I now appreciate the character
of your Flora. What a difference in regard to Europe your remark in
relation to the genera makes! I have been eminently glad to see your
conclusion in regard to the species of large genera widely ranging; it
is in strict conformity with the results I have worked out in several
ways. It is of great importance to my notions. By the way you have
paid me a GREAT compliment ("From some investigations of his own, this
sagacious naturalist inclines to think that [the species of] large
genera range over a larger area than the species of small genera
do."--Asa Gray, loc. cit.): to be SIMPLY mentioned even in such a paper
I consider a very great honour. One of your conclusions makes me groan,
viz., that the line of connection of the strictly alpine plants is
through Greenland. I should EXTREMELY like to see your reasons published
in detail, for it "riles" me (this is a proper expression, is it not?)
dreadfully. Lyell told me, that Agassiz having a theory about when
Saurians were first created, on hearing some careful observations
opposed to this, said he did not believe it, "for Nature never lied."
I am just in this predicament, and repeat to you that, "Nature never
lies," ergo, theorisers are always right...

Overworked as you are, I dare say you will say that I am an odious
plague; but here is another suggestion! I was led by one of my wild
speculations to conclude (though it has nothing to do with geographical
distribution, yet it has with your statistics) that trees would have a
strong tendency to have flowers with dioecious, monoecious or polygamous
structure. Seeing that this seemed so in Persoon, I took one little
British Flora, and discriminating trees from bushes according to Loudon,
I have found that the result was in species, genera and families, as I
anticipated. So I sent my notions to Hooker to ask him to tabulate the
New Zealand Flora for this end, and he thought my result sufficiently
curious, to do so; and the accordance with Britain is very striking, and
the more so, as he made three classes of trees, bushes, and herbaceous
plants. (He says further he shall work the Tasmanian Flora on the same
principle.) The bushes hold an intermediate position between the other
two classes. It seems to me a curious relation in itself, and is very
much so, if my theory and explanation are correct. (See 'Origin,'
Edition i., page 100.)

With hearty thanks, your most troublesome friend, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 12th [1857].

My dear Hooker,

Your letter has pleased me much, for I never can get it out of my head,
that I take unfair advantage of your kindness, as I receive all and give
nothing. What a splendid discussion you could write on the whole subject
of variation! The cases discussed in your last note are valuable to me
(though odious and damnable), as showing how profoundly ignorant we are
on the causes of variation. I shall just allude to these cases, as a
sort of sub-division of polymorphism a little more definite, I fancy,
than the variation of, for instance, the Rubi, and equally or more
perplexing.

I have just been putting my notes together on variations APPARENTLY due
to the immediate and direct action of external causes; and I have been
struck with one result. The most firm sticklers for independent creation
admit, that the fur of the SAME species is thinner towards the south of
the range of the same species than to the north--that the SAME shells
are brighter-coloured to the south than north; that the same [shell]
is paler-coloured in deep water--that insects are smaller and darker on
mountains--more livid and testaceous near sea--that plants are smaller
and more hairy and with brighter flowers on mountains: now in all such,
and other cases, distinct species in the two zones follow the same rule,
which seems to me to be most simply explained by species, being only
strongly marked varieties, and therefore following the same laws as
recognised and admitted varieties. I mention all this on account of the
variation of plants in ascending mountains; I have quoted the foregoing
remark only generally with no examples, for I add, there is so much
doubt and dispute what to call varieties; but yet I have stumbled on
so many casual remarks on VARIETIES of plants on mountains being so
characterised, that I presume there is some truth in it. What think
you? Do you believe there is ANY tendency in VARIETIES, as GENERALLY
so-called, of plants to become more hairy and with proportionally larger
and brighter-coloured flowers in ascending a mountain?

I have been interested in my "weed garden," of 3 x 2 feet square: I mark
each seedling as it appears, and I am astonished at the number that come
up, and still more at the number killed by slugs, etc. Already 59 have
been so killed; I expected a good many, but I had fancied that this
was a less potent check than it seems to be, and I attributed almost
exclusively to mere choking, the destruction of the seedlings.
Grass-seedlings seem to suffer much less than exogens...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Moor Park, Farnham [April (?) 1857].

My dear Hooker,

Your letter has been forwarded to me here, where I am undergoing
hydropathy for a fortnight, having been here a week, and having already
received an amount of good which is quite incredible to myself and quite
unaccountable. I can walk and eat like a hearty Christian, and even my
nights are good. I cannot in the least understand how hydropathy can act
as it certainly does on me. It dulls one's brain splendidly; I have not
thought about a single species of any kind since leaving home. Your note
has taken me aback; I thought the hairiness, etc., of Alpine SPECIES
was generally admitted; I am sure I have seen it alluded to a score of
times. Falconer was haranguing on it the other day to me. Meyen or Gay,
or some such fellow (whom you would despise), I remember, makes some
remark on Chilian Cordillera plants. Wimmer has written a little book on
the same lines, and on VARIETIES being so characterised in the Alps.
But after writing to you, I confess I was staggered by finding one
man (Moquin-Tandon, I think) saying that Alpine flowers are strongly
inclined to be white, and Linnaeus saying that cold makes plants
APETALOUS, even the same species! Are Arctic plants often apetalous? My
general belief from my compiling work is quite to agree with what
you say about the little direct influence of climate; and I have
just alluded to the hairiness of Alpine plants as an EXCEPTION. The
odoriferousness would be a good case for me if I knew of VARIETIES being
more odoriferous in dry habitats.

I fear that I have looked at the hairiness of Alpine plants as so
generally acknowledged that I have not marked passages, so as at all
to see what kind of evidence authors advance. I must confess, the other
day, when I asked Falconer, whether he knew of INDIVIDUAL plants losing
or acquiring hairiness when transported, he did not. But now THIS
SECOND, my memory flashes on me, and I am certain I have somewhere
got marked a case of hairy plants from the Pyrenees losing hairs when
cultivated at Montpellier. Shall you think me very impudent if I tell
you that I have sometimes thought that (quite independently of the
present case), you are a little too hard on bad observers; that a remark
made by a bad observer CANNOT be right; an observer who deserves to be
damned you would utterly damn. I feel entire deference to any remark you
make out of your own head; but when in opposition to some poor devil, I
somehow involuntarily feel not quite so much, but yet much deference for
your opinion. I do not know in the least whether there is any truth in
this my criticism against you, but I have often thought I would tell you
it.

I am really very much obliged for your letter, for, though I intended to
put only one sentence and that vaguely, I should probably have put that
much too strongly.

Ever, my dear Hooker, yours most truly, C. DARWIN.

P.S. This note, as you see, has not anything requiring an answer.

The distribution of fresh-water molluscs has been a horrid incubus to
me, but I think I know my way now; when first hatched they are very
active, and I have had thirty or forty crawl on a dead duck's foot; and
they cannot be jerked off, and will live fifteen and even twenty-four
hours out of water.


[The following letter refers to the expedition of the Austrian frigate
"Novara"; Lyell had asked my father for suggestions.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, February 11th [1857].

My dear Lyell,

I was glad to see in the newspapers about the Austrian Expedition. I
have nothing to add geologically to my notes in the Manual. (The article
"Geology" in the Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry.) I do not know
whether the Expedition is tied down to call at only fixed spots. But
if there be any choice or power in the scientific men to influence
the places--this would be most desirable. It is my most deliberate
conviction that nothing would aid more, Natural History, than careful
collecting and investigating ALL THE PRODUCTIONS of the most isolated
islands, especially of the southern hemisphere. Except Tristan d'Acunha
and Kerguelen Land, they are very imperfectly known; and even at
Kerguelen Land, how much there is to make out about the lignite beds,
and whether there are signs of old Glacial action. Every sea shell and
insect and plant is of value from such spots. Some one in the Expedition
especially ought to have Hooker's New Zealand Essay. What grand work to
explore Rodriguez, with its fossil birds, and little known productions
of every kind. Again the Seychelles, which, with the Cocos so near, must
be a remnant of some older land. The outer island of Juan Fernandez
is little known. The investigation of these little spots by a band of
naturalists would be grand; St. Paul's and Amsterdam would be glorious,
botanically, and geologically. Can you not recommend them to get my
'Journal' and 'Volcanic Islands' on account of the Galapagos. If they
come from the north it will be a shame and a sin if they do not call
at Cocos Islet, one of the Galapagos. I always regretted that I was
not able to examine the great craters on Albemarle Island, one of the
Galapagos. In New Zealand urge on them to look out for erratic boulders
and marks of old glaciers.

Urge the use of the dredge in the Tropics; how little or nothing we know
of the limit of life downward in the hot seas?

My present work leads me to perceive how much the domestic animals have
been neglected in out of the way countries.

The Revillagigedo Island off Mexico, I believe, has never been trodden
by foot of naturalist.

If the expedition sticks to such places as Rio, Cape of Good Hope,
Ceylon and Australia, etc., it will not do much.

Ever yours most truly, C. DARWIN.


[The following passage occurs in a letter to Mr. Fox, February 22, 1857,
and has reference to the book on Evolution on which he was still at
work. The remainder of the letter is made up in details of no interest:

"I am got most deeply interested in my subject; though I wish I could
set less value on the bauble fame, either present or posthumous, than
I do, but not I think, to any extreme degree: yet, if I know myself, I
would work just as hard, though with less gusto, if I knew that my book
would be published for ever anonymously."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Moor Park, May 1st, 1857.

My dear Sir,

I am much obliged for your letter of October 10th, from Celebes,
received a few days ago; in a laborious undertaking, sympathy is a
valuable and real encouragement. By your letter and even still more
by your paper ('On the law that has regulated the introduction of new
species.'--Ann. Nat. Hist., 1855.) in the Annals, a year or more ago, I
can plainly see that we have thought much alike and to a certain extent
have come to similar conclusions. In regard to the Paper in the Annals,
I agree to the truth of almost every word of your paper; and I dare
say that you will agree with me that it is very rare to find oneself
agreeing pretty closely with any theoretical paper; for it is lamentable
how each man draws his own different conclusions from the very same
facts. This summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first
note-book, on the question how and in what way do species and varieties
differ from each other. I am now preparing my work for publication,
but I find the subject so very large, that though I have written many
chapters, I do not suppose I shall go to press for two years. I have
never heard how long you intend staying in the Malay Archipelago; I wish
I might profit by the publication of your Travels there before my work
appears, for no doubt you will reap a large harvest of facts. I have
acted already in accordance with your advice of keeping domestic
varieties, and those appearing in a state of nature, distinct; but I
have sometimes doubted of the wisdom of this, and therefore I am glad to
be backed by your opinion. I must confess, however, I rather doubt the
truth of the now very prevalent doctrine of all our domestic animals
having descended from several wild stocks; though I do not doubt that
it is so in some cases. I think there is rather better evidence on the
sterility of hybrid animals than you seem to admit: and in regard to
plants the collection of carefully recorded facts by Kolreuter and
Gaertner (and Herbert,) is ENORMOUS. I most entirely agree with you on
the little effects of "climatal conditions," which one sees referred
to ad nauseam in all books: I suppose some very little effect must be
attributed to such influences, but I fully believe that they are very
slight. It is really IMPOSSIBLE to explain my views (in the compass of a
letter), on the causes and means of variation in a state of nature; but
I have slowly adopted a distinct and tangible idea,--whether true or
false others must judge; for the firmest conviction of the truth of a
doctrine by its author, seems, alas, not to be the slightest guarantee
of truth!...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Moor Park, Saturday [May 2nd, 1857].

My dear Hooker,

You have shaved the hair off the Alpine plants pretty effectually.
The case of the Anthyllis will make a "tie" with the believed case of
Pyrenees plants becoming glabrous at low levels. If I DO find that I
have marked such facts, I will lay the evidence before you. I wonder how
the belief could have originated! Was it through final causes to keep
the plants warm? Falconer in talk coupled the two facts of woolly Alpine
plants and mammals. How candidly and meekly you took my Jeremiad on your
severity to second-class men. After I had sent it off, an ugly little
voice asked me, once or twice, how much of my noble defence of the
poor in spirit and in fact, was owing to your having not seldom smashed
favourite notions of my own. I silenced the ugly little voice with
contempt, but it would whisper again and again. I sometimes despise
myself as a poor compiler as heartily as you could do, though I do
NOT despise my whole work, as I think there is enough known to lay a
foundation for the discussion on the origin of species. I have been led
to despise and laugh at myself as a compiler, for having put down that
"Alpine plants have large flowers," and now perhaps I may write over
these very words, "Alpine plants have small or apetalous flowers!"...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [May] 16th [1857].

My dear Hooker,

You said--I hope honestly--that you did not dislike my asking questions
on general points, you of course answering or not as time or inclination
might serve. I find in the animal kingdom that the proposition that any
part or organ developed normally (i.e., not a monstrosity) in a species
in any HIGH or UNUSUAL degree, compared with the same part or organ in
allied species, tends to be HIGHLY VARIABLE. I cannot doubt this from
my mass of collected facts. To give an instance, the Cross-bill is
very abnormal in the structure of its bill compared with other allied
Fringillidae, and the beak is EMINENTLY VARIABLE. The Himantopus,
remarkable from the wonderful length of its legs, is VERY variable in
the length of its legs. I could give MANY most striking and curious
illustrations in all classes; so many that I think it cannot be chance.
But I have NONE in the vegetable kingdom, owing, as I believe, to my
ignorance. If Nepenthes consisted of ONE or two species in a group with
a pitcher developed, then I should have expected it to have been very
variable; but I do not consider Nepenthes a case in point, for when a
whole genus or group has an organ, however anomalous, I do not expect
it to be variable,--it is only when one or few species differ greatly in
some one part or organ from the forms CLOSELY ALLIED to it in all other
respects, that I believe such part or organ to be highly variable. Will
you turn this in your mind? It is an important apparent LAW (!) for me.

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--I do not know how far you will care to hear, but I find
Moquin-Tandon treats in his 'Teratologie' on villosity of plants, and
seems to attribute more to dryness than altitude; but seems to think
that it must be admitted that mountain plants are villose, and that this
villosity is only in part explained by De Candolle's remark that the
dwarfed condition of mountain plants would condense the hairs, and
so give them the APPEARANCE of being more hairy. He quotes Senebier,
'Physiologie Vegetale,' as authority--I suppose the first authority, for
mountain plants being hairy.

If I could show positively that the endemic species were more hairy in
dry districts, then the case of the varieties becoming more hairy in dry
ground would be a fact for me.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 3rd [1857].

My dear Hooker,

I am going to enjoy myself by having a prose on my own subjects to you,
and this is a greater enjoyment to me than you will readily understand,
as I for months together do not open my mouth on Natural History.
Your letter is of great value to me, and staggers me in regard to my
proposition. I dare say the absence of botanical facts may in part be
accounted for by the difficulty of measuring slight variations. Indeed,
after writing, this occurred to me; for I have Crucianella stylosa
coming into flower, and the pistil ought to be very variable in length,
and thinking of this I at once felt how could one judge whether it was
variable in any high degree. How different, for instance, from the
beak of a bird! But I am not satisfied with this explanation, and am
staggered. Yet I think there is something in the law; I have had so
many instances, as the following: I wrote to Wollaston to ask him to
run through the Madeira Beetles and tell me whether any one presented
anything very anomalous in relation to its allies. He gave me a unique
case of an enormous head in a female, and then I found in his book,
already stated, that the size of the head was ASTONISHINGLY variable.
Part of the difference with plants may be accounted for by many of
my cases being secondary male or FEMALE characters, but then I have
striking cases with hermaphrodite Cirripedes. The cases seem to me
far too numerous for accidental coincidences, of great variability and
abnormal development. I presume that you will not object to my putting a
note saying that you had reflected over the case, and though one or
two cases seemed to support, quite as many or more seemed wholly
contradictory. This want of evidence is the more surprising to me, as
generally I find any proposition more easily tested by observations in
botanical works, which I have picked up, than in zoological works. I
never dreamed that you had kept the subject at all before your
mind. Altogether the case is one more of my MANY horrid puzzles. My
observations, though on so infinitely a small scale, on the struggle for
existence, begin to make me see a little clearer how the fight goes on.
Out of sixteen kinds of seed sown on my meadow, fifteen have germinated,
but now they are perishing at such a rate that I doubt whether more than
one will flower. Here we have choking which has taken place likewise on
a great scale, with plants not seedlings, in a bit of my lawn allowed
to grow up. On the other hand, in a bit of ground, 2 by 3 feet, I have
daily marked each seedling weed as it has appeared during March, April
and May, and 357 have come up, and of these 277 have ALREADY been killed
chiefly by slugs. By the way, at Moor Park, I saw rather a pretty case
of the effects of animals on vegetation: there are enormous commons with
clumps of old Scotch firs on the hills, and about eight or ten years ago
some of these commons were enclosed, and all round the clumps nice young
trees are springing up by the million, looking exactly as if planted,
so many are of the same age. In other parts of the common, not yet
enclosed, I looked for miles and not ONE young tree could be seen.
I then went near (within quarter of a mile of the clumps) and looked
closely in the heather, and there I found tens of thousands of young
Scotch firs (thirty in one square yard) with their tops nibbled off by
the few cattle which occasionally roam over these wretched heaths. One
little tree, three inches high, by the rings appeared to be twenty-six
years old, with a short stem about as thick as a stick of sealing-wax.
What a wondrous problem it is, what a play of forces, determining the
kind and proportion of each plant in a square yard of turf! It is to my
mind truly wonderful. And yet we are pleased to wonder when some animal
or plant becomes extinct.

I am so sorry that you will not be at the Club. I see Mrs. Hooker is
going to Yarmouth; I trust that the health of your children is not the
motive. Good-bye.

My dear Hooker, ever yours, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--I believe you are afraid to send me a ripe Edwardsia pod, for fear
I should float it from New Zealand to Chile!!!


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 5 [1857].

My dear Hooker,

I honour your conscientious care about the medals. (The Royal Society's
medals.) Thank God! I am only an amateur (but a much interested one) on
the subject.

It is an old notion of mine that more good is done by giving medals to
younger men in the early part of their career, than as a mere reward to
men whose scientific career is nearly finished. Whether medals ever do
any good is a question which does not concern us, as there the medals
are. I am almost inclined to think that I would rather lower the
standard, and give medals to young workers than to old ones with
no ESPECIAL claims. With regard to especial claims, I think it just
deserving your attention, that if general claims are once admitted, it
opens the door to great laxity in giving them. Think of the case of
a very rich man, who aided SOLELY with his money, but to a grand
extent--or such an inconceivable prodigy as a minister of the Crown who
really cared for science. Would you give such men medals? Perhaps medals
could not be better applied than EXCLUSIVELY to such men. I confess at
present I incline to stick to especial claims which can be put down on
paper...

I am much confounded by your showing that there are not obvious
instances of my (or rather Waterhouse's) law of abnormal developments
being highly variable. I have been thinking more of your remark about
the difficulty of judging or comparing variability in plants from the
great general variability of parts. I should look at the law as more
completely smashed if you would turn in your mind for a little while
for cases of great variability of an organ, and tell me whether it is
moderately easy to pick out such cases; For IF THEY CAN BE PICKED
OUT, and, notwithstanding, do not coincide with great or abnormal
development, it would be a complete smasher. It is only beginning in
your mind at the variability end of the question instead of at the
abnormality end. PERHAPS cases in which a part is highly variable in all
the species of a group should be excluded, as possibly being something
distinct, and connected with the perplexing subject of polymorphism.
Will you perfect your assistance by further considering, for a little,
the subject this way?

I have been so much interested this morning in comparing all my notes on
the variation of the several species of the genus Equus and the results
of their crossing. Taking most strictly analogous facts amongst the
blessed pigeons for my guide, I believe I can plainly see the colouring
and marks of the grandfather of the Ass, Horse, Quagga, Hemionus and
Zebra, some millions of generations ago! Should not I [have] sneer[ed]
at any one who made such a remark to me a few years ago; but my evidence
seems to me so good that I shall publish my vision at the end of my
little discussion on this genus.

I have of late inundated you with my notions, you best of friends and
philosophers.

Adios, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Moor Park, Farnham, June 25th [1857].

My dear Hooker,

This requires no answer, but I will ask you whenever we meet. Look at
enclosed seedling gorses, especially one with the top knocked off. The
leaves succeeding the cotyledons being almost clover-like in shape,
seems to me feebly analogous to embryonic resemblances in young animals,
as, for instance, the young lion being striped. I shall ask you whether
this is so...(See 'Power of Movement in Plants,' page 414.)

Dr. Lane (The physician at Moor Park.) and wife, and mother-in-law, Lady
Drysdale, are some of the nicest people I ever met.

I return home on the 30th. Good-bye, my dear Hooker.

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.


[Here follows a group of letters, of various dates, bearing on the
question of large genera varying.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. March 11th [1858].

I was led to all this work by a remark of Fries, that the species in
large genera were more closely related to each other than in small
genera; and if this were so, seeing that varieties and species are so
hardly distinguishable, I concluded that I should find more varieties
in the large genera than in the small...Some day I hope you will read
my short discussion on the whole subject. You have done me infinite
service, whatever opinion I come to, in drawing my attention to at least
the possibility or the probability of botanists recording more varieties
in the large than in the small genera. It will be hard work for me to be
candid in coming to my conclusion.

Ever yours, most truly, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--I shall be several weeks at my present job. The work has been
turning out badly for me this morning, and I am sick at heart; and, oh!
how I do hate species and varieties.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. July 14th [1857?].

...I write now to supplicate most earnestly a favour, viz., the loan of
"Boreau, Flore du centre de la France", either 1st or 2nd edition,
last best; also "Flora Ratisbonensis," by Dr. Furnrohr, in 'Naturhist.
Topographie von Regensburg, 1839.' If you can POSSIBLY spare them, will
you send them at once to the enclosed address. If you have not them,
will you send one line by return of post: as I must try whether
Kippist (The late Mr. Kippist was at this time in charge of the Linnean
Society's Library.) can anyhow find them, which I fear will be nearly
impossible in the Linnean Library, in which I know they are.

I have been making some calculations about varieties, etc., and talking
yesterday with Lubbock, he has pointed out to me the grossest blunder
which I have made in principle, and which entails two or three weeks'
lost work; and I am at a dead-lock till I have these books to go over
again, and see what the result of calculation on the right principle is.
I am the most miserable, bemuddled, stupid dog in all England, and am
ready to cry with vexation at my blindness and presumption.

Ever yours, most miserably, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN LUBBOCK. Down, [July] 14th [1857].

My dear Lubbock,

You have done me the greatest possible service in helping me to clarify
my brains. If I am as muzzy on all subjects as I am on proportion and
chance,--what a book I shall produce!

I have divided the New Zealand Flora as you suggested, there are 329
species in genera of 4 and upwards, and 323 in genera of 3 and less.

The 339 species have 51 species presenting one or more varieties. The
323 species have only 37. Proportionately (339: 323:: 51: 48.5) they
ought to have had 48 1/2 species presenting vars. So that the case goes
as I want it, but not strong enough, without it be general, for me to
have much confidence in. I am quite convinced yours is the right way; I
had thought of it, but should never have done it had it not been for my
most fortunate conversation with you.

Un quite shocked to find how easily I am muddled, for I had before
thought over the subject much, and concluded my way was fair. It is
dreadfully erroneous.

What a disgraceful blunder you have saved me from. I heartily thank you.

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--It is enough to make me tear up all my MS. and give up in despair.

It will take me several weeks to go over all my materials. But oh, if
you knew how thankful I am to you!


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August [1857].

My dear Hooker,

It is a horrid bore you cannot come soon, and I reproach myself that
I did not write sooner. How busy you must be! with such a heap of
botanists at Kew. Only think, I have just had a letter from Henslow,
saying he will come here between 11th and 15th! Is not that grand? Many
thanks about Furnrohr. I must humbly supplicate Kippist to search for
it: he most kindly got Boreau for me.

I am got extremely interested in tabulating, according to mere size
of genera, the species having any varieties marked by Greek letters or
otherwise: the result (as far as I have yet gone) seems to me one of the
most important arguments I have yet met with, that varieties are only
small species--or species only strongly marked varieties. The subject
is in many ways so very important for me; I wish much you would think of
any well-worked Floras with from 1000-2000 species, with the varieties
marked. It is good to have hair-splitters and lumpers. (Those who
make many species are the "splitters," and those who make few are the
"lumpers.") I have done, or am doing:--

  Babington.......................
  Henslow.........................
  British Flora. London Catalogue. H.C. Watson...

  Boreau.......................... France.

  Miquel.......................... Holland.

  Asa Gray........................ N.U. States.

  Hooker.......................... New Zealand.
                                    Fragment of Indian Flora.

  Wollaston....................... Madeira insects.


Has not Koch published a good German Flora? Does he mark varieties?
Could you send it me? Is there not some grand Russian Flora, which
perhaps has varieties marked? The Floras ought to be well known.

I am in no hurry for a few weeks. Will you turn this in your head when,
if ever, you have leisure? The subject is very important for my work,
though I clearly see MANY causes of error...


CHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, February 21st [1859].

My dear Gray,

My last letter begged no favour, this one does: but it will really cost
you very little trouble to answer to me, and it will be of very GREAT
service to me, owing to a remark made to me by Hooker, which I cannot
credit, and which was suggested to him by one of my letters. He
suggested my asking you, and I told him I would not give the least
hint what he thought. I generally believe Hooker implicitly, but he is
sometimes, I think, and he confesses it, rather over critical, and
his ingenuity in discovering flaws seems to me admirable. Here is my
question:--"Do you think that good botanists in drawing up a local
Flora, whether small or large, or in making a Prodromus like De
Candolle's, would almost universally, but unintentionally and
unconsciously, tend to record (i.e., marking with Greek letters and
giving short characters) varieties in the large or in the small genera?
Or would the tendency be to record the varieties about equally in genera
of all sizes? Are you yourself conscious on reflection that you have
attended to, and recorded more carefully the varieties in large or
small, or very small genera?"

I know what fleeting and trifling things varieties very often are;
but my query applies to such as have been thought worth marking and
recording. If you could screw time to send me ever so brief an answer to
this, pretty soon, it would be a great service to me.

Yours most truly obliged, CH. DARWIN.

P.S.--Do you know whether any one has ever published any remarks on the
geographical range of varieties of plants in comparison with the species
to which they are supposed to belong? I have in vain tried to get some
vague idea, and with the exception of a little information on this head
given me by Mr. Watson in a paper on Land Shells in United States, I
have quite failed; but perhaps it would be difficult for you to give me
even a brief answer on this head, and if so I am not so unreasonable, I
ASSURE YOU, as to expect it.

If you are writing to England soon, you could enclose other letters
[for] me to forward.

Please observe the question is not whether there are more or fewer
varieties in larger or smaller genera, but whether there is a stronger
or weaker tendency in the minds of botanists to RECORD such in large or
small genera.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 6th [1858].

...I send by this post my MS. on the "commonness," "range," and
"variation" of species in large and small genera. You have undertaken
a horrid job in so very kindly offering to read it, and I thank you
warmly. I have just corrected the copy, and am disappointed in finding
how tough and obscure it is; I cannot make it clearer, and at present
I loathe the very sight of it. The style of course requires further
correction, and if published I must try, but as yet see not how, to make
it clearer.

If you have much to say and can have patience to consider the whole
subject, I would meet you in London on the Phil. Club day, so as to save
you the trouble of writing. For Heaven's sake, you stern and awful judge
and sceptic, remember that my conclusions may be true, notwithstanding
that Botanists may have recorded more varieties in large than in small
genera. It seems to me a mere balancing of probabilities. Again I thank
you most sincerely, but I fear you will find it a horrid job.

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--As usual, Hydropathy has made a man of me for a short time: I hope
the sea will do Mrs. Hooker much good.


CHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, December 22nd, 1857.

My dear Sir,

I thank you for your letter of September 27th. I am extremely glad
to hear how you are attending to distribution in accordance with
theoretical ideas. I am a firm believer that without speculation there
is no good and original observation. Few travellers have attended to
such points as you are now at work on; and, indeed, the whole subject
of distribution of animals is dreadfully behind that of plants. You say
that you have been somewhat surprised at no notice having been taken
of your paper in the Annals. ('On the law that has regulated the
introduction of New Species.' Ann. Nat. Hist., 1855.) I cannot say that
I am, for so very few naturalists care for anything beyond the mere
description of species. But you must not suppose that your paper has not
been attended to: two very good men, Sir C. Lyell, and Mr. E. Blyth at
Calcutta, specially called my attention to it. Though agreeing with you
on your conclusions in that paper, I believe I go much further than you;
but it is too long a subject to enter on my speculative notions. I
have not yet seen your paper on the distribution of animals in the Aru
Islands. I shall read it with the utmost interest; for I think that the
most interesting quarter of the whole globe in respect to distribution,
and I have long been very imperfectly trying to collect data for the
Malay Archipelago. I shall be quite prepared to subscribe to your
doctrine of subsidence; indeed, from the quite independent evidence of
the Coral Reefs I coloured my original map (in my Coral volume) of
the Aru Islands as one of subsidence, but got frightened and left it
uncoloured. But I can see that you are inclined to go much further
than I am in regard to the former connection of oceanic islands with
continents. Ever since poor E. Forbes propounded this doctrine it has
been eagerly followed; and Hooker elaborately discusses the former
connection of all the Antarctic Islands and New Zealand and South
America. About a year ago I discussed this subject much with Lyell and
Hooker (for I shall have to treat of it), and wrote out my arguments in
opposition; but you will be glad to hear that neither Lyell nor Hooker
thought much of my arguments. Nevertheless, for once in my life, I dare
withstand the almost preternatural sagacity of Lyell.

You ask about land-shells on islands far distant from continents:
Madeira has a few identical with those of Europe, and here the evidence
is really good, as some of them are sub-fossil. In the Pacific Islands
there are cases of identity, which I cannot at present persuade myself
to account for by introduction through man's agency; although Dr.
Aug. Gould has conclusively shown that many land-shells have thus
been distributed over the Pacific by man's agency. These cases of
introduction are most plaguing. Have you not found it so in the Malay
Archipelago? It has seemed to me in the lists of mammals of Timor and
other islands, that SEVERAL in all probability have been naturalised...

You ask whether I shall discuss "man." I think I shall avoid the whole
subject, as so surrounded with prejudices; though I fully admit that it
is the highest and most interesting problem for the naturalist. My work,
on which I have now been at work more or less for twenty years, will
not fix or settle anything; but I hope it will aid by giving a large
collection of facts, with one definite end. I get on very slowly, partly
from ill-health, partly from being a very slow worker. I have got about
half written; but I do not suppose I shall publish under a couple of
years. I have now been three whole months on one chapter on Hybridism!

I am astonished to see that you expect to remain out three or four years
more. What a wonderful deal you will have seen, and what interesting
areas--the grand Malay Archipelago and the richest parts of South
America! I infinitely admire and honour your zeal and courage in the
good cause of Natural Science; and you have my very sincere and cordial
good wishes for success of all kinds, and may all your theories succeed,
except that on Oceanic Islands, on which subject I will do battle to the
death.

Pray believe me, my dear sir, yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. February 8th [1858].

...I am working very hard at my book, perhaps too hard. It will be very
big, and I am become most deeply interested in the way facts fall into
groups. I am like Croesus overwhelmed with my riches in facts, and I
mean to make my book as perfect as ever I can. I shall not go to press
at soonest for a couple of years...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. February 23rd [1858].

...I was not much struck with the great Buckle, and I admired the way
you stuck up about deduction and induction. I am reading his book ('The
History of Civilisation.'), which, with much sophistry, as it seems to
me, is WONDERFULLY clever and original, and with astounding knowledge.

I saw that you admired Mrs. Farrer's 'Questa tomba' of Beethoven
thoroughly; there is something grand in her sweet tones.

Farewell. I have partly written this note to drive bee's-cells out of
my head; for I am half-mad on the subject to try to make out some
simple steps from which all the wondrous angles may result. (He had
much correspondence on this subject with the late Professor Miller of
Cambridge.)

I was very glad to see Mrs. Hooker on Friday; how well she appears to be
and looks.

Forgive your intolerable but affectionate friend, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, April 16th [1858].

My dear Fox,

I want you to observe one point for me, on which I am extremely much
interested, and which will give you no trouble beyond keeping your eyes
open, and that is a habit I know full well that you have.

I find horses of various colours often have a spinal band or stripe of
different and darker tint than the rest of the body; rarely transverse
bars on the legs, generally on the under-side of the front legs, still
more rarely a very faint transverse shoulder-stripe like an ass.

Is there any breed of Delamere forest ponies? I have found out little
about ponies in these respects. Sir P. Egerton has, I believe, some
quite thoroughbred chestnut horses; have any of them the spinal stripe?
Mouse-coloured ponies, or rather small horses, often have spinal and leg
bars. So have dun horses (by dun I mean real colour of cream mixed with
brown, bay, or chestnut). So have sometimes chestnuts, but I have not
yet got a case of spinal stripe in chestnut, race horse, or in quite
heavy cart-horse. Any fact of this nature of such stripes in horses
would be MOST useful to me. There is a parallel case in the legs of
the donkey, and I have collected some most curious cases of stripes
appearing in various crossed equine animals. I have also a large mass of
parallel facts in the breeds of pigeons about the wing bars. I SUSPECT
it will throw light on the colour of the primeval horse. So do help me
if occasion turns up...My health has been lately very bad from
overwork, and on Tuesday I go for a fortnight's hydropathy. My work is
everlasting. Farewell.

My dear Fox, I trust you are well. Farewell, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Moor Park, Farnham [April 26th, 1858].

...I have just had the innermost cockles of my heart rejoiced by a
letter from Lyell. I said to him (or he to me) that I believed from
the character of the flora of the Azores, that icebergs must have been
stranded there; and that I expected erratic boulders would be detected
embedded between the upheaved lava-beds; and I got Lyell to write to
Hartung to ask, and now H. says my question explains what had astounded
him, viz., large boulders (and some polished) of mica-schist, quartz,
sandstone, etc., some embedded, and some 40 and 50 feet above the level
of the sea, so that he had inferred that they had not been brought as
ballast. Is this not beautiful?

The water-cure has done me some good, but I [am] nothing to boast of
to-day, so good-bye.

My dear friend, yours, C.D.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Moor Park, Farnham, April 26th [1858].

My dear Lyell,

I have come here for a fortnight's hydropathy, as my stomach had got,
from steady work, into a horrid state. I am extremely much obliged to
you for sending me Hartung's interesting letter. The erratic boulders
are splendid. It is a grand case of floating ice versus glaciers. He
ought to have compared the northern and southern shores of the islands.
It is eminently interesting to me, for I have written a very long
chapter on the subject, collecting briefly all the geological evidence
of glacial action in different parts of the world, and then at great
length (on the theory of species changing) I have discussed the
migration and modification of plants and animals, in sea and land, over
a large part of the world. To my mind, it throws a flood of light on
the whole subject of distribution, if combined with the modification of
species. Indeed, I venture to speak with some little confidence on this,
for Hooker, about a year ago, kindly read over my chapter, and though he
then demurred gravely to the general conclusion, I was delighted to hear
a week or two ago that he was inclined to come round pretty strongly to
my views of distribution and change during the glacial period. I had a
letter from Thompson, of Calcutta, the other day, which helps me much,
as he is making out for me what heat our temperate plants can endure.
But it is too long a subject for a note; and I have written thus only
because Hartung's note has set the whole subject afloat in my mind
again. But I will write no more, for my object here is to think
about nothing, bathe much, walk much, eat much, and read much novels.
Farewell, with many thanks, and very kind remembrance to Lady Lyell.

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO MRS. DARWIN. Moor Park, Wednesday, April [1858].

The weather is quite delicious. Yesterday, after writing to you, I
strolled a little beyond the glade for an hour and a half, and enjoyed
myself--the fresh yet dark-green of the grand Scotch firs, the brown of
the catkins of the old birches, with their white stems, and a fringe of
distant green from the larches made an excessively pretty view. At
last I fell fast asleep on the grass, and awoke with a chorus of
birds singing around me, and squirrels running up the trees, and some
woodpeckers laughing, and it was as pleasant and rural a scene as ever
I saw, and I did not care one penny how any of the beasts or birds had
been formed. I sat in the drawing-room till after eight, and then went
and read the Chief Justice's summing up, and thought Bernard (Simon
Bernard was tried in April 1858 as an accessory to Orsini's attempt on
the life of the Emperor of the French. The verdict was "not guilty.")
guilty, and then read a bit of my novel, which is feminine, virtuous,
clerical, philanthropical, and all that sort of thing, but very
decidedly flat. I say feminine, for the author is ignorant about money
matters, and not much of a lady--for she makes her men say, "My Lady."
I like Miss Craik very much, though we have some battles, and differ on
every subject. I like also the Hungarian; a thorough gentleman, formerly
attache at Paris, and then in the Austrian cavalry, and now a pardoned
exile, with broken health. He does not seem to like Kossuth, but says,
he is certain [he is] a sincere patriot, most clever and eloquent, but
weak, with no determination of character...




CHAPTER 1. XIII. -- THE WRITING OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'

JUNE 18, 1858, TO NOVEMBER, 1859.

[The letters given in the present chapter tell their story with
sufficient clearness, and need but a few words of explanation. Mr.
Wallace's Essay, referred to in the first letter, bore the sub-title,
'On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the Original
Type,' was published in the Linnean Society's Journal (1858, volume
iii. page 53) as part of the joint paper of "Messrs. C. Darwin and A.
Wallace," of which the full title was 'On the Tendency of Species to
form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by
Natural Means of Selection.'

My father's contribution to the paper consisted of (1) Extracts from
the sketch of 1844; (2) part of a letter addressed to Dr Asa Gray,
dated September 5, 1857, and which is given above. The paper was
"communicated" to the Society by Sir Charles Lyell and Sir Joseph
Hooker, in whose prefatory letter, a clear account of the circumstances
of the case is given.

Referring to Mr. Wallace's Essay, they wrote:

"So highly did Mr. Darwin appreciate the value of the views therein set
forth, that he proposed, in a letter to Sir Charles Lyell, to obtain
Mr. Wallace's consent to allow the Essay to be published as soon as
possible. Of this step we highly approved, provided Mr. Darwin did not
withhold from the public, as he was strongly inclined to do (in favour
of Mr. Wallace), the memoir which he had himself written on the same
subject, and which, as before stated, one of us had perused in 1844, and
the contents of which we had both of us been privy to for many years. On
representing this to Mr. Darwin, he gave us permission to make what
use we thought proper of his memoir, etc.; and in adopting our present
course, of presenting it to the Linnean Society, we have explained to
him that we are not solely considering the relative claims to priority
of himself and his friend, but the interests of science generally."]


LETTERS.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, 18th [June 1858].

My dear Lyell,

Some year or so ago you recommended me to read a paper by Wallace in the
'Annals' ('Annals and Magazine of Natural History', 1855.), which had
interested you, and, as I was writing to him, I knew this would please
him much, so I told him. He has to-day sent me the enclosed, and asked
me to forward it to you. It seems to me well worth reading. Your words
have come true with a vengeance--that I should be forestalled. You said
this, when I explained to you here very briefly my views of 'Natural
Selection' depending on the struggle for existence. I never saw a more
striking coincidence; if Wallace had my MS. sketch written out in 1842,
he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand
as heads of my chapters. Please return me the MS., which he does not say
he wishes me to publish, but I shall of course, at once write and offer
to send to any journal. So all my originality, whatever it may amount
to, will be smashed, though my book, if it will ever have any value,
will not be deteriorated; as all the labour consists in the application
of the theory.

I hope you will approve of Wallace's sketch, that I may tell him what
you say.

My dear Lyell, yours most truly, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, Friday [June 25, 1858].

My dear Lyell,

I am very sorry to trouble you, busy as you are, in so merely a personal
an affair; but if you will give me your deliberate opinion, you will do
me as great a service as ever man did, for I have entire confidence in
your judgment and honour...

There is nothing in Wallace's sketch which is not written out much
fuller in my sketch, copied out in 1844, and read by Hooker some dozen
years ago. About a year ago I sent a short sketch, of which I have a
copy, of my views (owing to correspondence on several points) to Asa
Gray, so that I could most truly say and prove that I take nothing
from Wallace. I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my
general views in about a dozen pages or so; but I cannot persuade myself
that I can do so honourably. Wallace says nothing about publication, and
I enclose his letter. But as I had not intended to publish any sketch,
can I do so honourably, because Wallace has sent me an outline of his
doctrine? I would far rather burn my whole book, than that he or any
other man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit. Do you
not think his having sent me this sketch ties my hands?... If I could
honourably publish, I would state that I was induced now to publish a
sketch (and I should be very glad to be permitted to say, to follow
your advice long ago given) from Wallace having sent me an outline of
my general conclusions. We differ only, [in] that I was led to my views
from what artificial selection has done for domestic animals. I would
send Wallace a copy of my letter to Asa Gray, to show him that I had not
stolen his doctrine. But I cannot tell whether to publish now would
not be base and paltry. This was my first impression, and I should have
certainly acted on it had it not been for your letter.

This is a trumpery affair to trouble you with, but you cannot tell how
much obliged I should be for your advice.

By the way, would you object to send this and your answer to Hooker to
be forwarded to me, for then I shall have the opinion of my two best and
kindest friends. This letter is miserably written, and I write it now,
that I may for a time banish the whole subject; and I am worn out with
musing...

My good dear friend forgive me. This is a trumpery letter, influenced by
trumpery feelings.

Yours most truly, C. DARWIN.

I will never trouble you or Hooker on the subject again.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, 26th [June, 1858].

My dear Lyell,

Forgive me for adding a P.S. to make the case as strong as possible
against myself.

Wallace might say, "You did not intend publishing an abstract of your
views till you received my communication. Is it fair to take advantage
of my having freely, though unasked, communicated to you my ideas, and
thus prevent me forestalling you?" The advantage which I should take
being that I am induced to publish from privately knowing that Wallace
is in the field. It seems hard on me that I should be thus compelled to
lose my priority of many years' standing, but I cannot feel at all
sure that this alters the justice of the case. First impressions are
generally right, and I at first thought it would be dishonourable in me
now to publish.

Yours most truly, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--I have always thought you would make a first-rate Lord Chancellor;
and I now appeal to you as a Lord Chancellor.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Tuesday [June 29, 1858].

...I have received your letters. I cannot think now (So soon after the
death, from scarlet fever, of his infant child.) on the subject, but
soon will. But I can see that you have acted with more kindness, and so
has Lyell, even than I could have expected from you both, most kind as
you are.

I can easily get my letter to Asa Gray copied, but it is too short.

...God bless you. You shall hear soon, as soon as I can think.

Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Tuesday night [June 29, 1858].

My dear Hooker,

I have just read your letter, and see you want the papers at once. I
am quite prostrated, and can do nothing, but I send Wallace, and the
abstract ("Abstract" is here used in the sense of "extract;" in this
sense also it occurs in the 'Linnean Journal,' where the sources of my
father's paper are described.) of my letter to Asa Gray, which gives
most imperfectly only the means of change, and does not touch on reasons
for believing that species do change. I dare say all is too late. I
hardly care about it. But you are too generous to sacrifice so much time
and kindness. It is most generous, most kind. I send my sketch of 1844
solely that you may see by your own handwriting that you did read it.
I really cannot bear to look at it. Do not waste much time. It is
miserable in me to care at all about priority.

The table of contents will show what it is.

I would make a similar, but shorter and more accurate sketch for the
'Linnean Journal.'

I will do anything. God bless you, my dear kind friend.

I can write no more. I send this by my servant to Kew.

Yours, C. DARWIN.


[The following letter is that already referred to as forming part of the
joint paper published in the Linnean Society's 'Journal,' 1858]:--


CHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, September 5th [1857]. (The date is
given as October in the 'Linnean Journal.' The extracts were printed
from a duplicate undated copy in my father's possession, on which he had
written, "This was sent to Asa Gray 8 or 9 months ago, I think October
1857.")

My dear Gray,

I forget the exact words which I used in my former letter, but I dare
say I said that I thought you would utterly despise me when I told you
what views I had arrived at, which I did because I thought I was bound
as an honest man to do so. I should have been a strange mortal, seeing
how much I owe to your quite extraordinary kindness, if in saying this
I had meant to attribute the least bad feeling to you. Permit me to tell
you that, before I had ever corresponded with you, Hooker had shown me
several of your letters (not of a private nature), and these gave me the
warmest feeling of respect to you; and I should indeed be ungrateful
if your letters to me, and all I have heard of you, had not strongly
enhanced this feeling. But I did not feel in the least sure that when
you knew whither I was tending, that you might not think me so wild and
foolish in my views (God knows, arrived at slowly enough, and I hope
conscientiously), that you would think me worth no more notice or
assistance. To give one example: the last time I saw my dear old friend
Falconer, he attacked me most vigorously, but quite kindly, and told me,
"You will do more harm than any ten Naturalists will do good. I can see
that you have already CORRUPTED and half-spoiled Hooker!!" Now when I
see such strong feeling in my oldest friends, you need not wonder that I
always expect my views to be received with contempt. But enough and too
much of this.

I thank you most truly for the kind spirit of your last letter. I agree
to every word in it, and think I go as far as almost any one in seeing
the grave difficulties against my doctrine. With respect to the extent
to which I go, all the arguments in favour of my notions fall RAPIDLY
away, the greater the scope of forms considered. But in animals,
embryology leads me to an enormous and frightful range. The facts which
kept me longest scientifically orthodox are those of adaptation--the
pollen-masses in asclepias--the mistletoe, with its pollen carried by
insects, and seed by birds--the woodpecker, with its feet and tail, beak
and tongue, to climb the tree and secure insects. To talk of climate or
Lamarckian habit producing such adaptations to other organic beings
is futile. This difficulty I believe I have surmounted. As you seem
interested in the subject, and as it is an IMMENSE advantage to me
to write to you and to hear, ever so briefly, what you think, I will
enclose (copied, so as to save you trouble in reading) the briefest
abstract of my notions on the means by which Nature makes her species.
Why I think that species have really changed, depends on general facts
in the affinities, embryology, rudimentary organs, geological history,
and geographical distribution of organic beings. In regard to my
Abstract, you must take immensely on trust, each paragraph occupying one
or two chapters in my book. You will, perhaps, think it paltry in me,
when I ask you not to mention my doctrine; the reason is, if any one,
like the author of the 'Vestiges,' were to hear of them, he might
easily work them in, and then I should have to quote from a work perhaps
despised by naturalists, and this would greatly injure any chance of
my views being received by those alone whose opinions I value. [Here
follows a discussion on "large genera varying," which has no direct
connection with the remainder of the letter.]

I. It is wonderful what the principle of Selection by Man, that is the
picking out of individuals with any desired quality, and breeding from
them, and again picking out, can do. Even breeders have been astonished
at their own results. They can act on differences inappreciable to an
uneducated eye. Selection has been METHODICALLY followed in Europe for
only the last half century. But it has occasionally, and even in some
degree methodically, been followed in the most ancient times. There must
have been also a kind of unconscious selection from the most ancient
times, namely, in the preservation of the individual animals (without
any thought of their offspring) most useful to each race of man in
his particular circumstances. The "roguing," as nursery-men call the
destroying of varieties, which depart from their type, is a kind of
selection. I am convinced that intentional and occasional selection has
been the main agent in making our domestic races. But, however this may
be, its great power of modification has been indisputedly shown in late
times. Selection acts only by the accumulation of very slight or greater
variations, caused by external conditions, or by the mere fact that in
generation the child is not absolutely similar to its parent. Man,
by this power of accumulating variations, adapts living beings to his
wants--he MAY BE SAID to make the wool of one sheep good for carpets,
and another for cloth, etc.

II. Now, suppose there was a being, who did not judge by mere external
appearance, but could study the whole internal organisation--who never
was capricious--who should go on selecting for one end during millions
of generations, who will say what he might not effect! In nature we have
some SLIGHT variations, occasionally in all parts: and I think it can be
shown that a change in the conditions of existence is the main cause
of the child not exactly resembling its parents; and in nature, geology
shows us what changes have taken place, and are taking place. We have
almost unlimited time: no one but a practical geologist can fully
appreciate this: think of the Glacial period, during the whole of which
the same species of shells at least have existed; there must have been
during this period, millions on millions of generations.

III. I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring power
at work, or NATURAL SELECTION (the title of my book), which selects
exclusively for the good of each organic being. The elder De Candolle,
W. Herbert, and Lyell, have written strongly on the struggle for life;
but even they have not written strongly enough. Reflect that every being
(even the elephant) breeds at such a rate that, in a few years, or at
most a few centuries or thousands of years, the surface of the earth
would not hold the progeny of any one species. I have found it hard
constantly to bear in mind that the increase of every single species is
checked during some part of its life, or during some shortly recurrent
generation. Only a few of those annually born can live to propagate
their kind. What a trifling difference must often determine which shall
survive and which perish.

IV. Now take the case of a country undergoing some change; this will
tend to cause some of its inhabitants to vary slightly; not but what I
believe most beings vary at all times enough for selection to act on.
Some of its inhabitants will be exterminated, and the remainder will be
exposed to the mutual action of a different set of inhabitants, which
I believe to be more important to the life of each being than mere
climate. Considering the infinitely various ways beings have to obtain
food by struggling with other beings, to escape danger at various times
of life, to have their eggs or seeds disseminated, etc., etc., I cannot
doubt that during millions of generations individuals of a species
will be born with some slight variation profitable to some part of its
economy; such will have a better chance of surviving, propagating this
variation, which again will be slowly increased by the accumulative
action of natural selection; and the variety thus formed will either
coexist with, or more commonly will exterminate its parent form. An
organic being like the woodpecker, or the mistletoe, may thus come to
be adapted to a score of contingencies; natural selection, accumulating
those slight variations in all parts of its structure which are in any
way useful to it, during any part of its life.

V. Multiform difficulties will occur to every one on this theory. Most
can, I think, be satisfactorily answered.--"Natura non facit saltum"
answer some of the most obvious. The slowness of the change, and only a
very few undergoing change at any one time answers others. The extreme
imperfections of our geological records answers others.

VI. One other principle, which may be called the principle of
divergence, plays, I believe, an important part in the origin of
species. The same spot will support more life if occupied by very
diverse forms: we see this in the many generic forms in a square yard of
turf (I have counted twenty species belonging to eighteen genera), or in
the plants and insects, on any little uniform islet, belonging to almost
as many genera and families as to species. We can understand this with
the higher animals, whose habits we best understand. We know that it
has been experimentally shown that a plot of land will yield a greater
weight, if cropped with several species of grasses, than with two or
three species. Now every single organic being, by propagating rapidly,
may be said to be striving its utmost to increase in numbers. So it will
be with the offspring of any species after it has broken into varieties,
or sub-species, or true species. And it follows, I think, from the
foregoing facts, that the varying offspring of each species will try
(only a few will succeed) to seize on as many and as diverse places
in the economy of nature as possible. Each new variety or species when
formed will generally take the place of, and so exterminate its
less well-fitted parent. This, I believe, to be the origin of the
classification or arrangement of all organic beings at all times. These
always SEEM to branch and sub-branch like a tree from a common trunk;
the flourishing twigs destroying the less vigorous--the dead and lost
branches rudely representing extinct genera and families.

This sketch is MOST imperfect; but in so short a space I cannot make
it better. Your imagination must fill up many wide blanks. Without some
reflection, it will appear all rubbish; perhaps it will appear so after
reflection.

C.D.

P.S.--This little abstract touches only the accumulative power of
natural selection, which I look at as by far the most important element
in the production of new forms. The laws governing the incipient or
primordial variation (unimportant except as the groundwork for selection
to act on, in which respect it is all important), I shall discuss under
several heads, but I can come, as you may well believe, only to very
partial and imperfect conclusions.


[The joint paper of Mr. Wallace and my father was read at the Linnean
Society on the evening of July 1st. Sir Charles Lyell and Sir J.D.
Hooker were present, and both, I believe, made a few remarks, chiefly
with a view of impressing on those present the necessity of giving the
most careful consideration to what they had heard. There was, however,
no semblance of a discussion. Sir Joseph Hooker writes to me: "The
interest excited was intense, but the subject was too novel and too
ominous for the old school to enter the lists, before armouring. After
the meeting it was talked over with bated breath: Lyell's approval, and
perhaps in a small way mine, as his lieutenant in the affair, rather
overawed the Fellows, who would otherwise have flown out against the
doctrine. We had, too, the vantage ground of being familiar with the
authors and their theme."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 5th [1858].

My dear Hooker,

We are become more happy and less panic-struck, now that we have sent
out of the house every child, and shall remove H.,as soon as she can
move. The first nurse became ill with ulcerated throat and quinsey,
and the second is now ill with the scarlet fever, but, thank God, is
recovering. You may imagine how frightened we have been. It has been a
most miserable fortnight. Thank you much for your note, telling me that
all had gone on prosperously at the Linnean Society. You must let me
once again tell you how deeply I feel your generous kindness and Lyell's
on this occasion. But in truth it shames me that you should have lost
time on a mere point of priority. I shall be curious to see the proofs.
I do not in the least understand whether my letter to A. Gray is to be
printed; I suppose not, only your note; but I am quite indifferent, and
place myself absolutely in your and Lyell's hands.

I can easily prepare an abstract of my whole work, but I can hardly see
how it can be made scientific for a Journal, without giving facts, which
would be impossible. Indeed, a mere abstract cannot be very short. Could
you give me any idea how many pages of the Journal could probably be
spared me?

Directly after my return home, I would begin and cut my cloth to my
measure. If the Referees were to reject it as not strictly scientific, I
could, perhaps publish it as a pamphlet.

With respect to my big interleaved abstract (The Sketch of 1844.), would
you send it any time before you leave England, to the enclosed address?
If you do not go till August 7th-10th, I should prefer it left with
you. I hope you have jotted criticisms on my MS. on big Genera, etc.,
sufficient to make you remember your remarks, as I should be infinitely
sorry to lose them. And I see no chance of our meeting if you go soon
abroad. We thank you heartily for your invitation to join you: I can
fancy nothing which I should enjoy more; but our children are too
delicate for us to leave; I should be mere living lumber.

Lastly, you said you would write to Wallace; I certainly should much
like this, as it would quite exonerate me: if you would send me your
note, sealed up, I would forward it with my own, as I know the address,
etc.

Will you answer me sometime about your notions of the length of my
abstract.

If you see Lyell, will you tell him how truly grateful I feel for his
kind interest in this affair of mine. You must know that I look at it,
as very important, for the reception of the view of species not being
immutable, the fact of the greatest Geologist and Botanist in England
taking ANY SORT OF INTEREST in the subject: I am sure it will do much to
break down prejudices.

Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Miss Wedgwood's, Hartfield, Tunbridge
Wells, [July 13th, 1858].

My dear Hooker,

Your letter to Wallace seems to me perfect, quite clear and most
courteous. I do not think it could possibly be improved, and I have
to day forwarded it with a letter of my own. I always thought it very
possible that I might be forestalled, but I fancied that I had a grand
enough soul not to care; but I found myself mistaken and punished; I
had, however, quite resigned myself, and had written half a letter to
Wallace to give up all priority to him, and should certainly not
have changed had it not been for Lyell's and your quite extraordinary
kindness. I assure you I feel it, and shall not forget it. I am MORE
than satisfied at what took place at the Linnean Society. I had thought
that your letter and mine to Asa Gray were to be only an appendix to
Wallace's paper.

We go from here in a few days to the sea-side, probably to the Isle of
Wight, and on my return (after a battle with pigeon skeletons) I will
set to work at the abstract, though how on earth I shall make anything
of an abstract in thirty pages of the Journal, I know not, but will try
my best. I shall order Bentham; is it not a pity that you should waste
time in tabulating varieties? for I can get the Down schoolmaster to do
it on my return, and can tell you all the results.

I must try and see you before your journey; but do not think I am
fishing to ask you to come to Down, for you will have no time for that.

You cannot imagine how pleased I am that the notion of Natural Selection
has acted as a purgative on your bowels of immutability. Whenever
naturalists can look at species changing as certain, what a magnificent
field will be open,--on all the laws of variation,--on the genealogy of
all living beings,--on their lines of migration, etc., etc. Pray thank
Mrs. Hooker for her very kind little note, and pray, say how truly
obliged I am, and in truth ashamed to think that she should have had
the trouble of copying my ugly MS. It was extraordinarily kind in her.
Farewell, my dear kind friend.

Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--I have had some fun here in watching a slave-making ant; for I
could not help rather doubting the wonderful stories, but I have now
seen a defeated marauding party, and I have seen a migration from one
nest to another of the slave-makers, carrying their slaves (who are
HOUSE, and not field niggers) in their mouths!

I am inclined to think that it is a true generalisation that, when honey
is secreted at one point of the circle of the corolla, if the pistil
bends, it always bends into the line of the gangway to the honey. The
Larkspur is a good instance, in contrast to Columbine,--if you think of
it, just attend to this little point.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. King's Head Hotel, Sandown, Isle of Wight,
July 18th [1858].

...We are established here for ten days, and then go on to Shanklin,
which seems more amusing to one, like myself, who cannot walk. We hope
much that the sea may do H. and L. good. And if it does, our expedition
will answer, but not otherwise.

I have never half thanked you for all the extraordinary trouble and
kindness you showed me about Wallace's affair. Hooker told me what was
done at the Linnean Society, and I am far more than satisfied, and I do
not think that Wallace can think my conduct unfair in allowing you and
Hooker to do whatever you thought fair. I certainly was a little annoyed
to lose all priority, but had resigned myself to my fate. I am going to
prepare a longer abstract; but it is really impossible to do justice
to the subject, except by giving the facts on which each conclusion is
grounded, and that will, of course, be absolutely impossible. Your name
and Hooker's name appearing as in any way the least interested in my
work will, I am certain, have the most important bearing in leading
people to consider the subject without prejudice. I look at this as so
very important, that I am almost glad of Wallace's paper for having led
to this.

My dear Lyell, yours most gratefully, CH. DARWIN.


[The following letter refers to the proof-sheets of the Linnean paper.
The 'introduction' means the prefatory letter signed by Sir C. Lyell and
Sir J.D. Hooker.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. King's Head Hotel, Sandown, Isle of
Wight, July 21st [1858].

My dear Hooker,

I received only yesterday the proof-sheets, which I now return. I think
your introduction cannot be improved.

I am disgusted with my bad writing. I could not improve it, without
rewriting all, which would not be fair or worth while, as I have begun
on a better abstract for the Linnean Society. My excuse is that it NEVER
was intended for publication. I have made only a few corrections in the
style; but I cannot make it decent, but I hope moderately intelligible.
I suppose some one will correct the revise. (Shall I?)

Could I have a clean proof to send to Wallace?

I have not yet fully considered your remarks on big genera (but your
general concurrence is of the HIGHEST POSSIBLE interest to me); nor
shall I be able till I re-read my MS.; but you may rely on it that
you never make a remark to me which is lost from INATTENTION. I am
particularly glad you do not object to my stating your objections in
a modified form, for they always struck me as very important, and as
having much inherent value, whether or no they were fatal to my notions.
I will consider and reconsider all your remarks...

I have ordered Bentham, for, as -- says, it will be very curious to see
a Flora written by a man who knows nothing of British plants!!

I am very glad at what you say about my Abstract, but you may rely on
it that I will condense to the utmost. I would aid in money if it is
too long. (That is to say, he would help to pay for the printing, if
it should prove too long for the Linnean Society.) In how many ways you
have aided me!

Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.

[The 'Abstract' mentioned in the last sentence of the preceding letter
was in fact the 'Origin of Species,' on which he now set to work. In his
'Autobiography' he speaks of beginning to write in September, but in
his Diary he wrote, "July 20 to August 12, at Sandown, began Abstract of
Species book." "September 16, Recommenced Abstract." The book was
begun with the idea that it would be published as a paper, or series of
papers, by the Linnean Society, and it was only in the late autumn that
it became clear that it must take the form of an independent volume.]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Norfolk House, Shanklin, Isle of Wight,
Friday [July] 30th [1858].

My dear Hooker,

Will you give the enclosed scrap to Sir William to thank him for his
kindness; and this gives me an excuse to amuse myself by writing to you
a note, which requires no answer.

This is a very charming place, and we have got a very comfortable house.
But, alas, I cannot say that the sea has done H. or L. much good. Nor
has my stomach recovered from all our troubles. I am very glad we left
home, for six children have now died of scarlet fever in Down. We return
on the 14th of August.

I have got Bentham ('British Flora.'), and am charmed with it, and
William (who has just started for a tour abroad) has been making out all
sorts of new (to me) plants capitally. The little scraps of information
are so capital...The English names in the analytical keys drive us mad:
give them by all means, but why on earth [not] make them subordinate to
the Latin; it puts me in a passion. W. charged into the Compositae and
Umbelliferae like a hero, and demolished ever so many in grand style.

I pass my time by doing daily a couple of hours of my Abstract, and I
find it amusing and improving work. I am now most heartily obliged to
you and Lyell for having set me on this; for I shall, when it is done,
be able to finish my work with greater ease and leisure. I confess I
hated the thought of the job; and now I find it very unsatisfactory in
not being able to give my reasons for each conclusion.

I will be longer than I expected; it will take thirty-five of my MS.
folio pages to give an abstract on variation under domestication alone;
but I will try to put in nothing which does not seem to me of some
interest, and which was once new to me. It seems a queer plan to give an
abstract of an unpublished work; nevertheless, I repeat, I am extremely
glad I have begun in earnest on it.

I hope you and Mrs. Hooker will have a very very pleasant tour.
Farewell, my dear Hooker.

Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Norfolk House, Shanklin, Isle of Wight,
Thursday [August 5, 1858].

My dear Hooker,

I should think the note apologetical about the style of the abstract was
best as a note...But I write now to ask you to send me by return of post
the MS. on big genera, that I may make an abstract of a couple of pages
in length. I presume that you have quite done with it, otherwise I would
not for anything have it back. If you tie it with string, and mark it
MS. for printing, it will not cost, I should think, more than 4 pence.
I shall wish much to say that you have read this MS. and concur; but you
shall, before I read it to the Society, hear the sentence.

What you tell me after speaking with Busk about the length of the
Abstract is an IMMENSE relief to me; it will make the labour far less,
not having to shorten so much every single subject; but I will try not
to be too diffusive. I fear it will spoil all interest in my book (The
larger book begun in 1856.), whenever published. The Abstract will
do very well to divide into several parts: thus I have just finished
"Variation under Domestication," in forty-four MS. pages, and that would
do for one evening; but I should be extremely sorry if all could not be
published together.

What else you say about my Abstract pleases me highly, but frightens me,
for I fear I shall never be able to make it good enough. But how I do
run on about my own affairs to you!

I was astonished to see Sir W. Hooker's card here two or three days
ago: I was unfortunately out walking. Henslow, also, has written to me,
proposing to come to Down on the 9th, but alas, I do not return till the
13th, and my wife not till a week later; so that I am also most sorry to
think I shall not see you, for I should not like to leave home so soon.
I had thought of going to London and running down for an hour or two to
Kew...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Norfolk House, Shanklin, Isle of Wight,
[August] [1858].

My dear Hooker,

I write merely to say that the MS. came safely two or three days ago.
I am much obliged for the correction of style: I find it unutterably
difficult to write clearly. When we meet I must talk over a few points
on the subject.

You speak of going to the sea-side somewhere; we think this the nicest
seaside place which we have ever seen, and we like Shanklin better than
other spots on the south coast of the island, though many are charming
and prettier, so that I would suggest your thinking of this place. We
are on the actual coast; but tastes differ so much about places.

If you go to Broadstairs, when there is a strong wind from the coast of
France and in fine, dry, warm weather, look out, and you will PROBABLY
(!) see thistle-seeds blown across the Channel. The other day I saw one
blown right inland, and then in a few minutes a second one and then a
third; and I said to myself, God bless me, how many thistles there must
be in France; and I wrote a letter in imagination to you. But I then
looked at the LOW clouds, and noticed that they were not coming inland,
so I feared a screw was loose. I then walked beyond a headland, and
found the wind parallel to the coast, and on this very headland a noble
bed of thistles, which by every wide eddy were blown far out to sea, and
then came right in at right angles to the shore! One day such a number
of insects were washed up by the tide, and I brought to life thirteen
species of Coleoptera; not that I suppose these came from France. But do
you watch for thistle-seed as you saunter along the coast...


CHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. August 11th [1858].

My dear Gray,

Your note of July 27th has just reached me in the Isle of Wight. It is a
real and great pleasure to me to write to you about my notions; and
even if it were not so, I should be a most ungrateful dog, after all
the invaluable assistance you have rendered me, if I did not do anything
which you asked.

I have discussed in my long MS. the later changes of climate and the
effect on migration, and I will here give you an ABSTRACT of an ABSTRACT
(which latter I am preparing of my whole work for the Linnean Society).
I cannot give you facts, and I must write dogmatically, though I do not
feel so on any point. I may just mention, in order that you may believe
that I have SOME foundation for my views, that Hooker has read my MS.,
and though he at first demurred to my main point, he has since told me
that further reflection and new facts have made him a convert.

In the older, or perhaps newer, Pliocene age (a little BEFORE the
Glacial epoch) the temperature was higher; of this there can be little
doubt; the land, on a LARGE SCALE, held much its present disposition:
the species were mainly, judging from shells, what they are now. At this
period when all animals and plants ranged 10 or 15 degrees nearer the
poles, I believe the northern part of Siberia and of North America being
almost CONTINUOUS, were peopled (it is quite possible, considering
the shallow water, that Behring Straits were united, perhaps a little
southward) by a nearly uniform fauna and flora, just as the Arctic
regions now are. The climate then became gradually colder till it became
what it now is; and then the temperate parts of Europe and America would
be separated, as far as migration is concerned, just as they now are.
Then came on the Glacial period, driving far south all living things;
middle or even southern Europe being peopled with Arctic productions;
as the warmth returned, the Arctic productions slowly crawled up the
mountains as they became denuded of snow; and we now see on their
summits the remnants of a once continuous flora and fauna. This is E.
Forbes' theory, which, however, I may add, I had written out four years
before he published.

Some facts have made me vaguely SUSPECT that between the glacial and
the present temperature there was a period of SLIGHTLY greater warmth.
According to my modification-doctrines, I look at many of the species of
North America which CLOSELY represent those of Europe, as having become
modified since the Pliocene period, when in the northern part of the
world there was nearly free communication between the old and new
worlds. But now comes a more important consideration; there is a
considerable body of geological evidence that during the Glacial epoch
the whole world was colder; I inferred that, many years ago, from
erratic boulder phenomena carefully observed by me on both the east and
west coast of South America. Now I am so bold as to believe that at the
height of the Glacial epoch, AND WHEN ALL TROPICAL PRODUCTIONS MUST
HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY DISTRESSED, that several temperate forms slowly
travelled into the heart of the Tropics, and even reached the southern
hemisphere; and some few southern forms penetrated in a reverse
direction northward. (Heights of Borneo with Australian forms, Abyssinia
with Cape forms.) Wherever there was nearly continuous HIGH land, this
migration would have been immensely facilitated; hence the European
character of the plants of Tierra del Fuego and summits of Cordilleras;
hence ditto on Himalaya. As the temperature rose, all the temperate
intruders would crawl up the mountains. Hence the European forms on
Nilgherries, Ceylon, summit of Java, Organ Mountains of Brazil. But
these intruders being surrounded with new forms would be very liable to
be improved or modified by natural selection, to adapt them to the new
forms with which they had to compete; hence most of the forms on the
mountains of the Tropics are not identical, but REPRESENTATIVE forms of
North temperate plants.

There are similar classes of facts in marine productions. All this will
appear very rash to you, and rash it may be; but I am sure not so rash
as it will at first appear to you: Hooker could not stomach it at all at
first, but has become largely a convert. From mammalia and shallow sea,
I believe Japan to have been joined to main land of China within no
remote period; and then the migration north and south before, during,
and after the Glacial epoch would act on Japan, as on the corresponding
latitude of China and the United States.

I should beyond anything like to know whether you have any Alpine
collections from Japan, and what is their character. This letter is
miserably expressed, but perhaps it will suffice to show what I believe
have been the later main migrations and changes of temperature...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [Down] October 6th, 1858.

...If you have or can make leisure, I should very much like to hear news
of Mrs. Hooker, yourself, and the children. Where did you go, and what
did you do and are doing? There is a comprehensive text.

You cannot tell how I enjoyed your little visit here, it did me much
good. If Harvey is still with you, pray remember me very kindly to him.

...I am working most steadily at my Abstract, but it grows to an
inordinate length; yet fully to make my view clear (and never giving
briefly more than a fact or two, and slurring over difficulties), I
cannot make it shorter. It will yet take me three or four months; so
slow do I work, though never idle. You cannot imagine what a service you
have done me in making me make this Abstract; for though I thought I had
got all clear, it has clarified my brains very much, by making me weigh
the relative importance of the several elements.

I have been reading with much interest your (as I believe it to be)
capital memoir of R. Brown in the "Gardeners' Chronicle"...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 12th, [1858].

...I have sent eight copies (Of the joint paper by C. Darwin and A.R.
Wallace.) by post to Wallace, and will keep the others for him, for I
could not think of any one to send any to.

I pray you not to pronounce too strongly against Natural Selection, till
you have read my abstract, for though I dare say you will strike out
MANY difficulties, which have never occurred to me; yet you cannot have
thought so fully on the subject as I have.

I expect my Abstract will run into a small volume, which will have to be
published separately...

What a splendid lot of work you have in hand.

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 13th [1858].

...I have been a little vexed at myself at having asked you not "to
pronounce too strongly against Natural Selection." I am sorry to have
bothered you, though I have been much interested by your note in answer.
I wrote the sentence without reflection. But the truth is, that I have
so accustomed myself, partly from being quizzed by my non-naturalist
relations, to expect opposition and even contempt, that I forgot for
the moment that you are the one living soul from whom I have constantly
received sympathy. Believe [me] that I never forget for even a minute
how much assistance I have received from you. You are quite correct that
I never even suspected that my speculations were a "jam-pot" to you;
indeed, I thought, until quite lately, that my MS. had produced no
effect on you, and this has often staggered me. Nor did I know that you
had spoken in general terms about my work to our friends, excepting to
dear old Falconer, who some few years ago once told me that I should do
more mischief than any ten other naturalists would do good, [and] that I
had half spoiled you already! All this is stupid egotistical stuff,
and I write it only because you may think me ungrateful for not having
valued and understood your sympathy; which God knows is not the case. It
is an accursed evil to a man to become so absorbed in any subject as I
am in mine.

I was in London yesterday for a few hours with Falconer, and he gave
me a magnificent lecture on the age of man. We are not upstarts; we can
boast of a pedigree going far back in time coeval with extinct species.
He has a grand fact of some large molar tooth in the Trias.

I am quite knocked up, and am going next Monday to revive under
Water-cure at Moor Park.

My dear Hooker, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. November 1858.

...I had vowed not to mention my everlasting Abstract to you again, for
I am sure I have bothered you far more than enough about it; but, as you
allude to its previous publication, I may say that I have the chapters
on Instinct and Hybridism to abstract, which may take a fortnight each;
and my materials for Palaeontology, Geographical Distribution, and
Affinities, being less worked up, I dare say each of these will take me
three weeks, so that I shall not have done at soonest till April, and
then my Abstract will in bulk make a small volume. I never give more
than one or two instances, and I pass over briefly all difficulties, and
yet I cannot make my Abstract shorter, to be satisfactory, than I am now
doing, and yet it will expand to a small volume...


[About this time my father revived his old knowledge of beetles in
helping his boys in their collecting. He sent a short notice to the
'Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer,' June 25th, 1859, recording the
capture of Licinus silphoides, Clytus mysticus, Panagaeus 4-pustulatus.
The notice begins with the words, "We three very young collectors having
lately taken in the parish of Down," etc., and is signed by three of his
boys, but was clearly not written by them. I have a vivid recollection
of the pleasure of turning out my bottle of dead beetles for my father
to name, and the excitement, in which he fully shared, when any of them
proved to be uncommon ones. The following letters to Mr. Fox (November
13, 1858), and to Sir John Lubbock, illustrate this point:]


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, November 13th [1858].

...W., my son, is now at Christ's College, in the rooms above yours.
My old Gyp, Impey, was astounded to hear that he was my son, and very
simply asked, "Why, has he been long married?" What pleasant hours those
were when I used to come and drink coffee with you daily! I am reminded
of old days by my third boy having just begun collecting beetles, and
he caught the other day Brachinus crepitans, of immortal Whittlesea
Mere memory. My blood boiled with old ardour when he caught a Licinus--a
prize unknown to me...


CHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN LUBBOCK. Thursday [before 1857].

Dear Lubbock,

I do not know whether you care about beetles, but for the chance I
send this in a bottle, which I never remember having seen; though it
is excessively rash to speak from a twenty-five-year old remembrance.
Whenever we meet you can tell me whether you know it...

I feel like an old war-horse at the sound of the trumpet, when I read
about the capturing of rare beetles--is not this a magnanimous simile
for a decayed entomologist?--It really almost makes me long to begin
collecting again. Adios.

"Floreat Entomologia"!--to which toast at Cambridge I have drunk many a
glass of wine. So again, "Floreat Entomologia." N.B. I have NOT now been
drinking any glasses full of wine.

Yours, C.D.


CHARLES DARWIN TO HERBERT SPENCER. Down, November 25th [1858].

Dear Sir,

I beg permission to thank you sincerely for your very kind present
of your Essays. ('Essays, Scientific, Political, and Speculative,' by
Herbert Spencer, 1858-74.) I have already read several of them with
much interest. Your remarks on the general argument of the so-called
development theory seems to me admirable. I am at present preparing an
Abstract of a larger work on the changes of species; but I treat the
subject simply as a naturalist, and not from a general point of view,
otherwise, in my opinion, your argument could not have been improved on,
and might have been quoted by me with great advantage. Your article
on Music has also interested me much, for I had often thought on the
subject, and had come to nearly the same conclusion with you, though
unable to support the notion in any detail. Furthermore, by a curious
coincidence, expression has been for years a persistent subject with
me for LOOSE speculation, and I must entirely agree with you that
all expression has some biological meaning. I hope to profit by your
criticism on style, and with very best thanks, I beg leave to remain,
dear Sir,

Yours truly obliged, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 24th [1858].

My dear Hooker,

Your news about your unsolicited salary and house is jolly, and
creditable to the Government. My room (28 x 19), with divided room
above, with ALL FIXTURES (and painted), not furniture, and plastered
outside, cost about 500 pounds. I am heartily glad of this news.

Your facts about distribution are, indeed, very striking. I remember
well that none of your many wonderful facts in your several works,
perplexed me, for years, more than the migration having been mainly from
north to south, and not in the reverse direction. I have now at last
satisfied MYSELF (but that is very different from satisfying others) on
this head; but it would take a little volume to fully explain myself.
I did not for long see the bearing of a conclusion, at which I had
arrived, with respect to this subject. It is, that species inhabiting a
very large area, and therefore existing in large numbers, and which have
been subjected to the severest competition with many other forms, will
have arrived, through natural selection, at a higher stage of perfection
than the inhabitants of a small area. Thus I explain the fact of so many
anomalies, or what may be called "living fossils," inhabiting now only
fresh water, having been beaten out, and exterminated in the sea, by
more improved forms; thus all existing Ganoid fishes are fresh water,
as [are] Lepidosiren and Ornithorhynchus, etc. The plants of Europe and
Asia, as being the largest territory, I look at as the most "improved,"
and therefore as being able to withstand the less-perfected Australian
plants; [whilst] these could not resist the Indian. See how all the
productions of New Zealand yield to those of Europe. I dare say you will
think all this utter bosh, but I believe it to be solid truth.

You will, I think, admit that Australian plants, flourishing so in
India, is no argument that they could hold their own against the ten
thousand natural contingencies of other plants, insects, animals, etc.,
etc. With respect to South West Australia and the Cape, I am shut up,
and can only d--n the whole case.

...You say you should like to see my MS., but you did read and approve
of my long Glacial chapter, and I have not yet written my Abstract on
the whole of the Geographical Distribution, nor shall I begin it for two
or three weeks. But either Abstract or the old MS. I should be DELIGHTED
to send you, especially the Abstract chapter...

I have now written 330 folio pages of my abstract, and it will require
150-200 [more]; so that it will make a printed volume of 400 pages,
and must be printed separately, which I think will be better in many
respects. The subject really seems to me too large for discussion at any
Society, and I believe religion would be brought in by men whom I know.

I am thinking of a 12mo volume, like Lyell's fourth or fifth edition of
the 'Principles.'...

I have written you a scandalously long note. So now good-bye, my dear
Hooker,

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 20th, 1859.

My dear Hooker,

I should very much like to borrow Heer at some future time, for I want
to read nothing perplexing at present till my Abstract is done.
Your last very instructive letter shall make me very cautious on the
hyper-speculative points we have been discussing.

When you say you cannot master the train of thoughts, I know well enough
that they are too doubtful and obscure to be mastered. I have often
experienced what you call the humiliating feeling of getting more and
more involved in doubt the more one thinks of the facts and reasoning
on doubtful points. But I always comfort myself with thinking of the
future, and in the full belief that the problems which we are just
entering on, will some day be solved; and if we just break the ground we
shall have done some service, even if we reap no harvest.

I quite agree that we only differ in DEGREE about the means of
dispersal, and that I think a satisfactory amount of accordance. You put
in a very striking manner the mutation of our continents, and I quite
agree; I doubt only about our oceans.

I also agree (I am in a very agreeing frame of mind) with your
argumentum ad hominem, about the highness of the Australian Flora
from the number of species and genera; but here comes in a superlative
bothering element of doubt, viz., the effect of isolation.

The only point in which I PRESUMPTUOUSLY rather demur is about the
status of the naturalised plants in Australia. I think Muller speaks of
their having spread largely beyond cultivated ground; and I can hardly
believe that our European plants would occupy stations so barren that
the native plants could not live there. I should require much evidence
to make me believe this. I have written this note merely to thank you,
as you will see it requires no answer.

I have heard to my amazement this morning from Phillips that the
Geological Council have given me the Wollaston Medal!!!

Ever yours, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 23d, 1859.

...I enclose letters to you and me from Wallace. I admire extremely the
spirit in which they are written. I never felt very sure what he would
say. He must be an amiable man. Please return that to me, and Lyell
ought to be told how well satisfied he is. These letters have vividly
brought before me how much I owe to your and Lyell's most kind and
generous conduct in all this affair.

...How glad I shall be when the Abstract is finished, and I can rest!...


CHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, January 25th [1859].

My dear Sir,

I was extremely much pleased at receiving three days ago your letter to
me and that to Dr. Hooker. Permit me to say how heartily I admire
the spirit in which they are written. Though I had absolutely nothing
whatever to do in leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought a fair
course of action, yet I naturally could not but feel anxious to hear
what your impression would be. I owe indirectly much to you and them;
for I almost think that Lyell would have proved right, and I should
never have completed my larger work, for I have found my Abstract hard
enough with my poor health, but now, thank God, I am in my last chapter
but one. My Abstract will make a small volume of 400 or 500 pages.
Whenever published, I will, of course, send you a copy, and then you
will see what I mean about the part which I believe selection has played
with domestic productions. It is a very different part, as you suppose,
from that played by "Natural Selection." I sent off, by the same address
as this note, a copy of the 'Journal of the Linnean Society,' and
subsequently I have sent some half-dozen copies of the paper. I have
many other copies at your disposal...

I am glad to hear that you have been attending to birds' nests. I have
done so, though almost exclusively under one point of view, viz., to
show that instincts vary, so that selection could work on and improve
them. Few other instincts, so to speak, can be preserved in a Museum.

Many thanks for your offer to look after horses' stripes; If there
are any donkeys, pray add them. I am delighted to hear that you have
collected bees' combs...This is an especial hobby of mine, and I think
I can throw a light on the subject. If you can collect duplicates, at no
very great expense, I should be glad of some specimens for myself with
some bees of each kind. Young, growing, and irregular combs, and
those which have not had pupae, are most valuable for measurements and
examination. Their edges should be well protected against abrasion.

Every one whom I have seen has thought your paper very well written and
interesting. It puts my extracts (written in 1839, now just twenty years
ago!), which I must say in apology were never for an instant intended
for publication, into the shade.

You ask about Lyell's frame of mind. I think he is somewhat staggered,
but does not give in, and speaks with horror, often to me, of what a
thing it would be, and what a job it would be for the next edition of
'The Principles,' if he were "PERverted." But he is most candid and
honest, and I think will end by being PERverted. Dr. Hooker has become
almost as heterodox as you or I, and I look at Hooker as BY FAR the most
capable judge in Europe.

Most cordially do I wish you health and entire success in all your
pursuits, and, God knows, if admirable zeal and energy deserve success,
most amply do you deserve it. I look at my own career as nearly run out.
If I can publish my Abstract and perhaps my greater work on the same
subject, I shall look at my course as done.

Believe me, my dear sir, yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 2nd [1859].

My dear Hooker,

Here is an odd, though very little, fact. I think it would be hardly
possible to name a bird which apparently could have less to do with
distribution than a Petrel. Sir W. Milner, at St. Kilda, cut open some
young nestling Petrels, and he found large, curious nuts in their crops;
I suspect picked up by parent birds from the Gulf stream. He seems to
value these nuts excessively. I have asked him (but I doubt whether
he will) to send a nut to Sir William Hooker (I gave this address for
grandeur sake) to see if any of you can name it and its native country.
Will you PLEASE MENTION this to Sir William Hooker, and if the nut does
arrive, will you oblige me by returning it to "Sir W. Milner, Bart.,
Nunappleton, Tadcaster," in a registered letter, and I will repay you
postage. Enclose slip of paper with the name and country if you can, and
let me hereafter know. Forgive me asking you to take this much trouble;
for it is a funny little fact after my own heart.

Now for another subject. I have finished my Abstract of the chapter on
Geographical Distribution, as bearing on my subject. I should like you
much to read it; but I say this, believing that you will not do so, if,
as I believe to be the case, you are extra busy. On my honour, I shall
not be mortified, and I earnestly beg you not to do it, if it will
bother you. I want it, because I here feel especially unsafe, and errors
may have crept in. Also, I should much like to know what parts you will
MOST VEHEMENTLY object to. I know we do, and must, differ widely on
several heads. Lastly, I should like particularly to know whether I
have taken anything from you, which you would like to retain for first
publication; but I think I have chiefly taken from your published
works, and, though I have several times, in this chapter and elsewhere,
acknowledged your assistance, I am aware that it is not possible for
me in the Abstract to do it sufficiently. ("I never did pick any one's
pocket, but whilst writing my present chapter I keep on feeling (even
when differing most from you) just as if I were stealing from you, so
much do I owe to your writings and conversation, so much more than mere
acknowledgments show."--Letter to Sir J.D. Hooker, 1859.) But again
let me say that you must not offer to read it if very irksome. It is
long--about ninety pages, I expect, when fully copied out.

I hope you are all well. Moor Park has done me some good.

Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--Heaven forgive me, here is another question: How far am I right
in supposing that with plants, the most important characters for main
divisions are Embryological? The seed itself cannot be considered as
such, I suppose, nor the albumens, etc. But I suppose the Cotyledons and
their position, and the position of the plumule and the radicle, and the
position and form of the whole embryo in the seed are embryological, and
how far are these very important? I wish to instance plants as a case
of high importance of embryological characters in classification. In the
Animal Kingdom there is, of course, no doubt of this.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 5th [1859].

My dear Hooker,

Many thanks about the seed...it is curious. Petrels at St. Kilda
apparently being fed by seeds raised in the West Indies. It should be
noted whether it is a nut ever imported into England. I am VERY glad
you will read my Geographical MS.; it is now copying, and it will (I
presume) take ten days or so in being finished; it shall be sent as soon
as done...

I shall be very glad to see your embryological ideas on plants; by the
sentence which I sent you, you will see that I only want one sentence;
if facts are at all, as I suppose, and I shall see this from your note,
for sending which very many thanks.

I have been so poorly, the last three days, that I sometimes doubt
whether I shall ever get my little volume done, though so nearly
completed...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 15th [1859].

My dear Hooker,

I am PLEASED at what you say of my chapter. You have not attacked it
nearly so much as I feared you would. You do not seem to have detected
MANY errors. It was nearly all written from memory, and hence I was
particularly fearful; it would have been better if the whole had first
been carefully written out, and abstracted afterwards. I look at it as
morally certain that it must include much error in some of its general
views. I will just run over a few points in your note, but do not
trouble yourself to reply without you have something important to say...

...I should like to know whether the case of Endemic bats in islands
struck you; it has me especially; perhaps too strongly.

With hearty thanks, ever yours, C. DARWIN.

P.S. You cannot tell what a relief it has been to me your looking over
this chapter, as I felt very shaky on it.

I shall to-morrow finish my last chapter (except a recapitulation) on
Affinities, Homologies, Embryology, etc., and the facts seem to me to
come out VERY strong for mutability of species.

I have been much interested in working out the chapter.

I shall now, thank God, begin looking over the old first chapters for
press.

But my health is now so very poor, that even this will take me long.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down [March] 24th [1859].

My dear Fox,

It was very good of you to write to me in the midst of all your
troubles, though you seem to have got over some of them, in the recovery
of your wife's and your own health. I had not heard lately of your
mother's health, and am sorry to hear so poor an account. But as she
does not suffer much, that is the great thing; for mere life I do not
think is much valued by the old. What a time you must have had of it,
when you had to go backwards and forwards.

We are all pretty well, and our eldest daughter is improving. I can see
daylight through my work, and am now finally correcting my chapters for
the press; and I hope in a month or six weeks to have proof-sheets. I am
weary of my work. It is a very odd thing that I have no sensation that
I overwork my brain; but facts compel me to conclude that my brain was
never formed for much thinking. We are resolved to go for two or three
months, when I have finished, to Ilkley, or some such place, to see if
I can anyhow give my health a good start, for it certainly has been
wretched of late, and has incapacitated me for everything. You do me
injustice when you think that I work for fame; I value it to a certain
extent; but, if I know myself, I work from a sort of instinct to try to
make out truth. How glad I should be if you could sometime come to Down;
especially when I get a little better, as I still hope to be. We have
set up a billiard table, and I find it does me a deal of good, and
drives the horrid species out of my head. Farewell, my dear old friend.

Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, March 28th [1859].

My dear Lyell,

If I keep decently well, I hope to be able to go to press with my volume
early in May. This being so, I want much to beg a little advice from
you. From an expression in Lady Lyell's note, I fancy that you have
spoken to Murray. Is it so? And is he willing to publish my Abstract?
If you will tell me whether anything, and what has passed, I will then
write to him. Does he know at all of the subject of the book? Secondly,
can you advise me, whether I had better state what terms of publication
I should prefer, or first ask him to propose terms? And what do you
think would be fair terms for an edition? Share profits, or what?

Lastly, will you be so very kind as to look at the enclosed title and
give me your opinion and any criticisms; you must remember that, if I
have health and it appears worth doing, I have a much larger and full
book on the same subject nearly ready.

My Abstract will be about five hundred pages of the size of your first
edition of the 'Elements of Geology.'

Pray forgive me troubling you with the above queries; and you shall have
no more trouble on the subject. I hope the world goes well with you, and
that you are getting on with your various works.

I am working very hard for me, and long to finish and be free and try to
recover some health.

My dear Lyell, ever yours, C. DARWIN.

Very sincere thanks to you for standing my proxy for the Wollaston
Medal.

P.S. Would you advise me to tell Murray that my book is not more
UN-orthodox than the subject makes inevitable. That I do not discuss the
origin of man. That I do not bring in any discussion about Genesis,
etc., etc., and only give facts, and such conclusions from them as seem
to me fair.

Or had I better say NOTHING to Murray, and assume that he cannot object
to this much unorthodoxy, which in fact is not more than any Geological
Treatise which runs slap counter to Genesis.

CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, March 30th [1859].

My dear Lyell,

You have been uncommonly kind in all you have done. You not only have
saved me much trouble and some anxiety, but have done all incomparably
better than I could have done it. I am much pleased at all you say about
Murray. I will write either to-day or to-morrow to him, and will send
shortly a large bundle of MS., but unfortunately I cannot for a week, as
the first three chapters are in the copyists' hands.

I am sorry about Murray objecting to the term Abstract, as I look at
it as the only possible apology for NOT giving references and facts in
full, but I will defer to him and you. I am also sorry about the term
"natural selection." I hope to retain it with explanation somewhat as
thus--

"Through natural selection, or the preservation of favoured Races."

Why I like the term is that it is constantly used in all works on
breeding, and I am surprised that it is not familiar to Murray; but I
have so long studied such works that I have ceased to be a competent
judge.

I again most truly and cordially thank you for your really valuable
assistance.

Yours most truly, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 2nd [1859].

...I wrote to him [Mr. Murray] and gave him the headings of the
chapters, and told him he could not have the MS. for ten days or so;
and this morning I received a letter, offering me handsome terms, and
agreeing to publish without seeing the MS.! So he is eager enough; I
think I should have been cautious, anyhow, but, owing to your letter,
I told him most EXPLICITLY that I accept his offer solely on condition
that, after he has seen part or all the MS., he has full power of
retracting. You will think me presumptuous, but I think my book will
be popular to a certain extent (enough to ensure [against] heavy loss)
amongst scientific and semi-scientific men; why I think so is, because
I have found in conversation so great and surprising an interest amongst
such men, and some o-scientific [non-scientific] men on this subject,
and all my chapters are not NEARLY so dry and dull as that which you
have read on geographical distribution. Anyhow, Murray ought to be the
best judge, and if he chooses to publish it, I think I may wash my hands
of all responsibility. I am sure my friends, i.e., Lyell and you, have
been EXTRAORDINARILY kind in troubling yourselves on the matter.

I shall be delighted to see you the day before Good Friday; there would
be one advantage for you in any other day--as I believe both my boys
come home on that day--and it would be almost impossible that I could
send the carriage for you. There will, I believe, be some relations in
the house--but I hope you will not care for that, as we shall easily get
as much talking as my IMBECILE STATE allows. I shall deeply enjoy seeing
you.

...I am tired, so no more.

My dear Hooker, your affectionate, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--Please to send, well TIED UP with strong string, my Geographical
MS., towards the latter half of next week--i.e., 7th or 8th--that I may
send it with more to Murray; and God help him if he tries to read it.

...I cannot help a little doubting whether Lyell would take much pains
to induce Murray to publish my book; this was not done at my request,
and it rather grates against my pride.

I know that Lyell has been INFINITELY kind about my affair, but your
dashed (i.e., underlined) "INDUCE" gives the idea that Lyell had
unfairly urged Murray.


CHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. April 4th [1859].

...You ask to see my sheets as printed off; I assure you that it will be
the HIGHEST satisfaction to me to do so: I look at the request as a high
compliment. I shall not, you may depend, forget a request which I look
at as a favour. But (and it is a heavy "but" to me) it will be long
before I go to press; I can truly say I am NEVER idle; indeed, I work
too hard for my much weakened health; yet I can do only three hours of
work daily, and I cannot at all see when I shall have finished: I have
done eleven long chapters, but I have got some other very difficult
ones: as palaeontology, classifications, and embryology, etc., and I
have to correct and add largely to all those done. I find, alas! each
chapter takes me on an average three months, so slow I am. There is
no end to the necessary digressions. I have just finished a chapter on
Instinct, and here I found grappling with such a subject as bees'
cells, and comparing all my notes made during twenty years, took up a
despairing length of time.

But I am running on about myself in a most egotistical style. Yet I must
just say how useful I have again and again found your letters, which I
have lately been looking over and quoting! but you need not fear that I
shall quote anything you would dislike, for I try to be very cautious
on this head. I most heartily hope you may succeed in getting your
"incubus" of old work off your hands, and be in some degree a free
man...

Again let me say that I do indeed feel grateful to you...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J. MURRAY. Down, April 5th [1859].

My dear Sir,

I send by this post, the Title (with some remarks on a separate page),
and the first three chapters. If you have patience to read all Chapter
I., I honestly think you will have a fair notion of the interest of the
whole book. It may be conceit, but I believe the subject will interest
the public, and I am sure that the views are original. If you think
otherwise, I must repeat my request that you will freely reject my
work; and though I shall be a little disappointed, I shall be in no way
injured.

If you choose to read Chapters II. and III., you will have a dull and
rather abstruse chapter, and a plain and interesting one, in my opinion.

As soon as you have done with the MS., please to send it by CAREFUL
MESSENGER, AND PLAINLY DIRECTED, to Miss G. Tollett, 14, Queen Anne
Street, Cavendish Square.

This lady, being an excellent judge of style, is going to look out for
errors for me.

You must take your own time, but the sooner you finish, the sooner she
will, and the sooner I shall get to press, which I so earnestly wish.

I presume you will wish to see Chapter IV., the key-stone of my arch,
and Chapters X. and XI., but please to inform me on this head.

My dear Sir, yours sincerely, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 11th [1859].

...I write one line to say that I heard from Murray yesterday, and he
says he has read the first three chapters of one MS.(and this includes a
very dull one), and he abides by his offer. Hence he does not want more
MS., and you can send my Geographical chapter when it pleases you...


[Part of the MS. seems to have been lost on its way back to my father;
he wrote (April 14) to Sir J.D. Hooker:]

"I have the old MS., otherwise, the loss would have killed me! The worst
is now that it will cause delay in getting to press, and FAR WORST of
all, lose all advantage of your having looked over my chapter, except
the third part returned. I am very sorry Mrs. Hooker took the trouble of
copying the two pages."


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [April or May, 1859].

...Please do not say to any one that I thought my book on Species would
be fairly popular, and have a fairly remunerative sale (which was the
height of my ambition), for if it prove a dead failure, it would make me
the more ridiculous.

I enclose a criticism, a taste of the future--

REV. S. HAUGHTON'S ADDRESS TO THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY, DUBLIN. (February
9, 1859.)

"This speculation of Messrs. Darwin and Wallace would not be worthy
of notice were it not for the weight of authority of the names (i.e.
Lyell's and yours), under whose auspices it has been brought forward. If
it means what it says, it is a truism; if it means anything more, it is
contrary to fact."

Q.E.D.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 11th [1859].

My dear Hooker,

Thank you for telling me about obscurity of style. But on my life no
nigger with lash over him could have worked harder at clearness than
I have done. But the very difficulty to me, of itself leads to the
probability that I fail. Yet one lady who has read all my MS. has found
only two or three obscure sentences, but Mrs. Hooker having so found
it, makes me tremble. I will do my best in proofs. You are a good man to
take the trouble to write about it.

With respect to our mutual muddle ("When I go over the chapter I will
see what I can do, but I hardly know how I am obscure, and I think we
are somehow in a mutual muddle with respect to each other, from starting
from some fundamentally different notions."--Letter of May 6, 1859.),
I never for a moment thought we could not make our ideas clear to each
other by talk, or if either of us had time to write in extenso.

I imagine from some expressions (but if you ask me what, I could not
answer) that you look at variability as some necessary contingency with
organisms, and further that there is some necessary tendency in the
variability to go on diverging in character or degree. IF YOU DO, I do
not agree. "Reversion" again (a form of inheritance), I look at as in no
way directly connected with Variation, though of course inheritance is
of fundamental importance to us, for if a variation be not inherited,
it is of no significance to us. It was on such points as these I FANCIED
that we perhaps started differently.

I fear that my book will not deserve at all the pleasant things you say
about it; and Good Lord, how I do long to have done with it!

Since the above was written, I have received and have been MUCH
INTERESTED by A. Gray. I am delighted at his note about my and Wallace's
paper. He will go round, for it is futile to give up very many species,
and stop at an arbitrary line at others. It is what my grandfather
called Unitarianism, "a feather bed to catch a falling Christian."...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 18th [1859].

My dear Hooker,

My health has quite failed. I am off to-morrow for a week of Hydropathy.
I am very very sorry to say that I cannot look over any proofs (Of Sir
J. Hooker's Introduction to the 'Flora of Australia.') in the week,
as my object is to drive the subject out of my head. I shall return
to-morrow week. If it be worth while, which probably it is not, you
could keep back any proofs till my return home.

In haste, ever yours, C. DARWIN.


[Ten days later he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:

"...I write one word to say that I shall return on Saturday, and if you
have any proof-sheets to send, I shall be glad to do my best in any
criticisms. I had... great prostration of mind and body, but entire
rest, and the douche, and 'Adam Bede,' have together done me a world of
good."]


CHARLES DARWIN TO J. MURRAY. Down, June 14th [1859].

My dear Sir,

The diagram will do very well, and I will send it shortly to Mr. West to
have a few trifling corrections made.

I get on very slowly with proofs. I remember writing to you that I
thought there would not be much correction. I honestly wrote what I
thought, but was most grievously mistaken. I find the style incredibly
bad, and most difficult to make clear and smooth. I am extremely
sorry to say, on account of expense, and loss of time for me, that
the corrections are very heavy, as heavy as possible. But from casual
glances, I still hope that later chapters are not so badly written. How
I could have written so badly is quite inconceivable, but I suppose
it was owing to my whole attention being fixed on the general line of
argument, and not on details. All I can say is, that I am very sorry.

Yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.

P.S. I have been looking at the corrections, and considering them.
It seems to me that I shall put you to a quite unfair expense. If
you please I should like to enter into some such arrangement as the
following: when work completed, you to allow in the account a fairly
moderately heavy charge for corrections, and all excess over that to be
deducted from my profits, or paid by me individually.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, June 21st [1859].

I am working very hard, but get on slowly, for I find that my
corrections are terrifically heavy, and the work most difficult to me. I
have corrected 130 pages, and the volume will be about 500. I have tried
my best to make it clear and striking, but very much fear that I have
failed--so many discussions are and must be very perplexing. I have done
my best. If you had all my materials, I am sure you would have made a
splendid book. I long to finish, for I am nearly worn out.

My dear Lyell, ever yours most truly, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 22nd [June, 1859].

My dear Hooker,

I did not answer your pleasant note, with a good deal of news to me,
of May 30th, as I have been expecting proofs from you. But now, having
nothing particular to do, I will fly a note, though I have nothing
particular to say or ask. Indeed, how can a man have anything to say,
who spends every day in correcting accursed proofs; and such proofs! I
have fairly to blacken them, and fasten slips of paper on, so miserable
have I found the style. You say that you dreamt that my book was
ENTERTAINING; that dream is pretty well over with me, and I begin to
fear that the public will find it intolerably dry and perplexing. But I
will never give up that a better man could have made a splendid book
out of the materials. I was glad to hear about Prestwich's paper. (Mr.
Prestwich wrote on the occurrence of flint instruments associated with
the remains of extinct animals in France.--(Proc. R. Soc., 1859.))
My doubt has been (and I see Wright has inserted the same in the
'Athenaeum') whether the pieces of flint are really tools; their
numbers make me doubt, and when I formerly looked at Boucher de Perthe's
drawings, I came to the conclusion that they were angular fragments
broken by ice action.

Did crossing the Acacia do any good? I am so hard worked, that I can
make no experiments. I have got only to 150 pages in first proof.

Adios, my dear Hooker, ever yours, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J. MURRAY. Down, July 25th [1859].

My dear Sir,

I write to say that five sheets are returned to the printers ready to
strike off, and two more sheets require only a revise; so that I presume
you will soon have to decide what number of copies to print off.

I am quite incapable of forming an opinion. I think I have got the style
FAIRLY good and clear, with infinite trouble. But whether the book will
be successful to a degree to satisfy you, I really cannot conjecture. I
heartily hope it may.

My dear Sir, yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, August 9th, 1859.

My dear Mr. Wallace,

I received your letter and memoir (This seems to refer to Mr. Wallace's
paper, "On the Zoological Geography of the Malay Archipelago," 'Linn.
Soc. Journ,' 1860.) on the 7th, and will forward it to-morrow to the
Linnean Society. But you will be aware that there is no meeting till
the beginning of November. Your paper seems to me ADMIRABLE in matter,
style, and reasoning; and I thank you for allowing me to read it. Had I
read it some months ago, I should have profited by it for my forthcoming
volume. But my two chapters on this subject are in type, and, though not
yet corrected, I am so wearied out and weak in health, that I am fully
resolved not to add one word, and merely improve the style. So you will
see that my views are nearly the same with yours, and you may rely on it
that not one word shall be altered owing to my having read your
ideas. Are you aware that Mr. W. Earl (Probably Mr. W. Earle's paper,
Geographical Soc. Journal, 1845.) published several years ago the view
of distribution of animals in the Malay Archipelago, in relation to the
depth of the sea between the islands? I was much struck with this,
and have been in the habit of noting all facts in distribution in
that archipelago, and elsewhere, in this relation. I have been led
to conclude that there has been a good deal of naturalisation in the
different Malay islands, and which I have thought, to a certain extent,
would account for anomalies. Timor has been my greatest puzzle. What do
you say to the peculiar Felis there? I wish that you had visited Timor;
it has been asserted that a fossil mastodon's or elephant's tooth (I
forget which) has been found there, which would be a grand fact. I was
aware that Celebes was very peculiar; but the relation to Africa is
quite new to me, and marvellous, and almost passes belief. It is as
anomalous as the relation of PLANTS in S.W. Australia to the Cape of
Good Hope. I differ WHOLLY from you on the colonisation of oceanic
islands, but you will have EVERY ONE else on your side. I quite agree
with respect to all islands not situated far in the ocean. I quite agree
on the little occasional intermigration between lands [islands?] when
once pretty well stocked with inhabitants, but think this does not apply
to rising and ill-stocked islands. Are you aware that ANNUALLY birds are
blown to Madeira, the Azores (and to Bermuda from America). I wish I had
given a fuller abstract of my reasons for not believing in Forbes' great
continental extensions; but it is too late, for I will alter nothing--I
am worn out, and must have rest. Owen, I do not doubt, will bitterly
oppose us...Hooker is publishing a grand introduction to the Flora of
Australia, and goes the whole length. I have seen proofs of about half.
With every good wish.

Believe me, yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 1st [1859].

...I am not surprised at your finding your Introduction very difficult.
But do not grudge the labour, and do not say you "have burnt your
fingers," and are "deep in the mud"; for I feel sure that the result
will be well worth the labour. Unless I am a fool, I must be a judge
to some extent of the value of such general essays, and I am fully
convinced that yours are the must valuable ever published.

I have corrected all but the last two chapters of my book, and hope to
have done revises and all in about three weeks, and then I (or we all)
shall start for some months' hydropathy; my health has been very bad,
and I am becoming as weak as a child, and incapable of doing anything
whatever, except my three hours daily work at proof-sheets. God knows
whether I shall ever be good at anything again, perhaps a long rest and
hydropathy may do something.

I have not had A. Gray's Essay, and should not feel up to criticise it,
even if I had the impertinence and courage. You will believe me that
I speak strictly the truth when I say that your Australian Essay is
EXTREMELY interesting to me, rather too much so. I enjoy reading it
over, and if you think my criticisms are worth anything to you, I beg
you to send the sheets (if you can give me time for good days); but
unless I can render you any little, however little assistance, I would
rather read the essay when published. Pray understand that I should be
TRULY vexed not to read them, if you wish it for your own sake.

I had a terribly long fit of sickness yesterday, which makes the world
rather extra gloomy to-day, and I have an insanely strong wish to finish
my accursed book, such corrections every page has required as I never
saw before. It is so weariful, killing the whole afternoon, after 12
o'clock doing nothing whatever. But I will grumble no more. So farewell,
we shall meet in the winter I trust.

Farewell, my dear Hooker, your affectionate friend, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, September 2nd [1859].

...I am very glad you wish to see my clean sheets: I should have offered
them, but did not know whether it would bore you; I wrote by this
morning's post to Murray to send them. Unfortunately I have not got to
the part which will interest you, I think most, and which tells most
in favour of the view, viz., Geological Succession, Geographical
Distribution, and especially Morphology, Embryology and Rudimentary
Organs. I will see that the remaining sheets, when printed off, are sent
to you. But would you like for me to send the last and perfect revises
of the sheets as I correct them? if so, send me your address in a blank
envelope. I hope that you will read all, whether dull (especially latter
part of Chapter II.) or not, for I am convinced there is not a sentence
which has not a bearing on the whole argument. You will find Chapter
IV. perplexing and unintelligible, without the aid of the enclosed queer
diagram (The diagram illustrates descent with divergence.), of which
I send an old and useless proof. I have, as Murray says, corrected so
heavily, as almost to have re-written it; but yet I fear it is poorly
written. Parts are intricate; and I do not think that even you could
make them quite clear. Do not, I beg, be in a hurry in committing
yourself (like so many naturalists) to go a certain length and no
further; for I am deeply convinced that it is absolutely necessary to
go the whole vast length, or stick to the creation of each separate
species; I argue this point briefly in the last chapter. Remember that
your verdict will probably have more influence than my book in deciding
whether such views as I hold will be admitted or rejected at present; in
the future I cannot doubt about their admittance, and our posterity will
marvel as much about the current belief as we do about fossils shells
having been thought to have been created as we now see them. But forgive
me for running on about my hobby-horse...


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [September] 11th [1859].

My dear Hooker,

I corrected the last proof yesterday, and I have now my revises, index,
etc., which will take me near to the end of the month. So that the neck
of my work, thank God, is broken.

I write now to say that I am uneasy in my conscience about hesitating to
look over your proofs, but I was feeling miserably unwell and shattered
when I wrote. I do not suppose I could be of hardly any use, but if I
could, pray send me any proofs. I should be (and fear I was) the most
ungrateful man to hesitate to do anything for you after some fifteen or
more years' help from you.

As soon as ever I have fairly finished I shall be off to Ilkley, or some
other Hydropathic establishment. But I shall be some time yet, as my
proofs have been so utterly obscured with corrections, that I have to
correct heavily on revises.

Murray proposes to publish the first week in November. Oh, good heavens,
the relief to my head and body to banish the whole subject from my mind!

I hope to God, you do not think me a brute about your proof-sheets.

Farewell, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, September 20th [1859].

My dear Lyell,

You once gave me intense pleasure, or rather delight, by the way you
were interested, in a manner I never expected, in my Coral Reef notions,
and now you have again given me similar pleasure by the manner you have
noticed my species work. (Sir Charles was President of the Geological
section at the meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen in 1859.
The following passage occurs in the address: "On this difficult and
mysterious subject a work will very shortly appear by Mr. Charles
Darwin, the result of twenty years of observations and experiments in
Zoology, Botany, and Geology, by which he had been led to the conclusion
that those powers of nature which give rise to races and permanent
varieties in animals and plants, are the same as those which in much
longer periods produce species, and in a still longer series of ages
give rise to differences of generic rank. He appears to me to have
succeeded by his investigations and reasonings in throwing a flood
of light on many classes of phenomena connected with the affinities,
geographical distribution, and geological succession of organic beings,
for which no other hypothesis has been able, or has even attempted to
account.") Nothing could be more satisfactory to me, and I thank you for
myself, and even more for the subject's sake, as I know well that
the sentence will make many fairly consider the subject, instead of
ridiculing it. Although your previously felt doubts on the immutability
of species, may have more influence in converting you (if you be
converted) than my book; yet as I regard your verdict as far more
important in my own eyes, and I believe in the eyes of the world than of
any other dozen men, I am naturally very anxious about it. Therefore
let me beg you to keep your mind open till you receive (in perhaps a
fortnight's time) my latter chapters, which are the most important of
all on the favourable side. The last chapter, which sums up and balances
in a mass all the arguments contra and pro, will, I think, be useful to
you. I cannot too strongly express my conviction of the general truth
of my doctrines, and God knows I have never shirked a difficulty. I am
foolishly anxious for your verdict, not that I shall be disappointed if
you are not converted; for I remember the long years it took me to
come round; but I shall be most deeply delighted if you do come round,
especially if I have a fair share in the conversion, I shall then
feel that my career is run, and care little whether I ever am good for
anything again in this life.

Thank you much for allowing me to put in the sentence about your grave
doubt. (As to the immutability of species, 'Origin,' Edition i., page
310.) So much and too much about myself.

I have read with extreme interest in the Aberdeen paper about the flint
tools; you have made the whole case far clearer to me; I suppose that
you did not think the evidence sufficient about the Glacial period.

With cordial thanks for your splendid notice of my book.

Believe me, my dear Lyell, your affectionate disciple, CHARLES DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, September 23rd [1859].

My dear Fox,

I was very glad to get your letter a few days ago. I was wishing to hear
about you, but have been in such an absorbed, slavish, overworked
state, that I had not heart without compulsion to write to any one or
do anything beyond my daily work. Though your account of yourself is
better, I cannot think it at all satisfactory, and I wish you would soon
go to Malvern again. My father used to believe largely in an old saying
that, if a man grew thinner between fifty and sixty years of age, his
chance of long life was poor, and that on the contrary it was a very
good sign if he grew fatter; so that your stoutness, I look at as a
very good omen. My health has been as bad as it well could be all this
summer; and I have kept on my legs, only by going at short intervals to
Moor Park; but I have been better lately, and, thank Heaven, I have at
last as good as done my book, having only the index and two or three
revises to do. It will be published in the first week in November, and a
copy shall be sent you. Remember it is only an Abstract (but has cost
me above thirteen months to write!!), and facts and authorities are far
from given in full. I shall be curious to hear what you think of it, but
I am not so silly as to expect to convert you. Lyell has read about
half of the volume in clean sheets, and gives me very great kudos. He
is wavering so much about the immutability of species, that I expect
he will come round. Hooker has come round, and will publish his belief
soon. So much for my abominable volume, which has cost me so much labour
that I almost hate it. On October 3rd I start for Ilkley, but shall
take three days for the journey! It is so late that we shall not take
a house; but I go there alone for three or four weeks, then return home
for a week and go to Moor Park for three or four weeks, and then I shall
get a moderate spell of hydropathy: and I intend, if I can keep to my
resolution, of being idle this winter. But I fear ennui will be as bad
as a bad stomach...


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, September 25th [1859].

My dear Lyell,

I send by this post four corrected sheets. I have altered the sentence
about the Eocene fauna being beaten by recent, thanks to your remark.
But I imagined that it would have been clear that I supposed the climate
to be nearly similar; you do not doubt, I imagine, that the climate of
the eocene and recent periods in DIFFERENT parts of the world could
be matched. Not that I think climate nearly so important as most
naturalists seem to think. In my opinion no error is more mischievous
than this.

I was very glad to find that Hooker, who read over, in MS., my
Geographical chapters, quite agreed in the view of the greater
importance of organic relations. I should like you to consider page 77
and reflect on the case of any organism in the midst of its range.

I shall be curious hereafter to hear what you think of distribution
during the glacial and preceding warmer periods. I am so glad you do
not think the Chapter on the Imperfection of the Geological Record
exaggerated; I was more fearful about this chapter than about any part.

Embryology in Chapter VIII. is one of my strongest points I think. But
I must not bore you by running on. My mind is so wearisomely full of the
subject.

I do thank you for your eulogy at Aberdeen. I have been so wearied and
exhausted of late that I have for months doubted whether I have not been
throwing away time and labour for nothing. But now I care not what the
universal world says; I have always found you right, and certainly on
this occasion I am not going to doubt for the first time. Whether you go
far, or but a very short way with me and others who believe as I do, I
am contented, for my work cannot be in vain. You would laugh if you knew
how often I have read your paragraph, and it has acted like a little
dram...

Farewell, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, September 30th [1859].

My dear Lyell,

I sent off this morning the last sheets, but without index, which is not
in type. I look at you as my Lord High Chancellor in Natural Science,
and therefore I request you, after you have finished, just to RERUN over
the heads in the Recapitulation-part of last chapter. I shall be deeply
anxious to hear what you decide (if you are able to decide) on the
balance of the pros and contras given in my volume, and of such other
pros and contras as may occur to you. I hope that you will think that I
have given the difficulties fairly. I feel an entire conviction that if
you are now staggered to any moderate extent, that you will come more
and more round, the longer you keep the subject at all before your mind.
I remember well how many long years it was before I could look into the
faces of some of the difficulties and not feel quite abashed. I fairly
struck my colours before the case of neuter insects.

I suppose that I am a very slow thinker, for you would be surprised at
the number of years it took me to see clearly what some of the problems
were which had to be solved, such as the necessity of the principle of
divergence of character, the extinction of intermediate varieties, on
a continuous area, with graduated conditions; the double problem of
sterile first crosses and sterile hybrids, etc., etc.

Looking back, I think it was more difficult to see what the problems
were than to solve them, so far as I have succeeded in doing, and this
seems to me rather curious. Well, good or bad, my work, thank God, is
over; and hard work, I can assure you, I have had, and much work which
has never borne fruit. You can see, by the way I am scribbling, that
I have an idle and rainy afternoon. I was not able to start for Ilkley
yesterday as I was too unwell; but I hope to get there on Tuesday or
Wednesday. Do, I beg you, when you have finished my book and thought a
little over it, let me hear from you. Never mind and pitch into me, if
you think it requisite; some future day, in London possibly, you may
give me a few criticisms in detail, that is, if you have scribbled any
remarks on the margin, for the chance of a second edition.

Murray has printed 1250 copies, which seems to me rather too large an
edition, but I hope he will not lose.

I make as much fuss about my book as if it were my first. Forgive me,
and believe me, my dear Lyell,

Yours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Ilkley, Yorkshire, October 15th [1859].

My dear Hooker,

Be a good man and screw out time enough to write me a note and tell me a
little about yourself, your doings, and belongings.

Is your Introduction fairly finished? I know you will abuse it, and I
know well how much I shall like it. I have been here nearly a fortnight,
and it has done me very much good, though I sprained my ankle last
Sunday, which has quite stopped walking. All my family come here on
Monday to stop three or four weeks, and then I shall go back to the
great establishment, and stay a fortnight; so that if I can keep my
spirits, I shall stay eight weeks here, and thus give hydropathy a
fair chance. Before starting here I was in an awful state of stomach,
strength, temper, and spirits. My book has been completely finished some
little time; as soon as copies are ready, of course one will be sent
you. I hope you will mark your copy with scores, so that I may profit
by any criticisms. I should like to hear your general impression. From
Lyell's letters, he thinks favourably of it, but seems staggered by
the lengths to which I go. But if you go any considerable length in the
admission of modification, I can see no possible means of drawing the
line, and saying here you must stop. Lyell is going to reread my book,
and I yet entertain hopes that he will be converted, or perverted, as he
calls it. Lyell has been EXTREMELY kind in writing me three volume-like
letters; but he says nothing about dispersal during the glacial period.
I should like to know what he thinks on this head. I have one question
to ask: Would it be any good to send a copy of my book to Decaisne?
and do you know any philosophical botanists on the Continent, who read
English and care for such subjects? if so, give their addresses. How
about Andersson in Sweden? You cannot think how refreshing it is to
idle away the whole day, and hardly ever think in the least about my
confounded book which half-killed me. I much wish I could hear of your
taking a real rest. I know how very strong you are, mentally, but I
never will believe you can go on working as you have worked of late with
impunity. You will some day stretch the string too tight. Farewell, my
good, and kind, and dear friend,

Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Ilkley, Otley, Yorkshire, October 15th
[1859].

My dear Huxley,

I am here hydropathising and coming to life again, after having finished
my accursed book, which would have been easy work to any one else, but
half-killed me. I have thought you would give me one bit of information,
and I know not to whom else to apply; viz., the addresses of Barrande,
Von Siebold, Keyserling (I dare say Sir Roderick would know the latter).

Can you tell me of any good and SPECULATIVE foreigners to whom it would
be worth while to send copies of my book, on the 'Origin of Species'?
I doubt whether it is worth sending to Siebold. I should like to send a
few copies about, but how many I can afford I know not yet till I hear
what price Murray affixes.

I need not say that I will send, of course, one to you, in the first
week of November. I hope to send copies abroad immediately. I shall be
INTENSELY curious to hear what effect the book produces on you. I know
that there will be much in it which you will object to, and I do not
doubt many errors. I am very far from expecting to convert you to many
of my heresies; but if, on the whole, you and two or three others think
I am on the right road, I shall not care what the mob of naturalists
think. The penultimate chapter (Chapter XIII. is on Classification,
Morphology, Embryology, and Rudimentary Organs.), though I believe it
includes the truth, will, I much fear, make you savage. Do not act and
say, like Macleay versus Fleming, "I write with aqua fortis to bite into
brass."

Ever yours, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Ilkley, Yorkshire, October 20th [1859].

My dear Lyell,

I have been reading over all your letters consecutively, and I do not
feel that I have thanked you half enough for the extreme pleasure which
they have given me, and for their utility. I see in them evidence of
fluctuation in the degree of credence you give to the theory; nor am
I at all surprised at this, for many and many fluctuations I have
undergone.

There is one point in your letter which I did not notice, about the
animals (and many plants) naturalised in Australia, which you think
could not endure without man's aid. I cannot see how man does aid the
feral cattle. But, letting that pass, you seem to think, that because
they suffer prodigious destruction during droughts, that they would all
be destroyed. In the "gran secos" of La Plata, the indigenous animals,
such as the American deer, die by thousands, and suffer apparently as
much as the cattle. In parts of India, after a drought, it takes ten
or more years before the indigenous mammals get up to their full number
again. Your argument would, I think, apply to the aborigines as well as
to the feral.

An animal or plant which becomes feral in one small territory might be
destroyed by climate, but I can hardly believe so, when once feral over
several large territories. Again, I feel inclined to swear at climate:
do not think me impudent for attacking you about climate. You say you
doubt whether man could have existed under the Eocene climate, but man
can now withstand the climate of Esquimaux-land and West Equatorial
Africa; and surely you do not think the Eocene climate differed from the
present throughout all Europe, as much as the Arctic regions differ from
Equatorial Africa?

With respect to organisms being created on the American type in America,
it might, I think, be said that they were so created to prevent them
being too well created, so as to beat the aborigines; but this seems to
me, somehow, a monstrous doctrine.

I have reflected a good deal on what you say on the necessity of
continued intervention of creative power. I cannot see this necessity;
and its admission, I think, would make the theory of Natural Selection
valueless. Grant a simple Archetypal creature, like the Mud-fish or
Lepidosiren, with the five senses and some vestige of mind, and I
believe natural selection will account for the production of every
vertebrate animal.

Farewell; forgive me for indulging in this prose, and believe me, with
cordial thanks,

Your ever attached disciple, C. DARWIN.

P.S.--When, and if, you reread, I supplicate you to write on the margin
the word "expand," when too condensed, or "not clear." or "?." Such
marks would cost you little trouble, and I could copy them and reflect
on them, and their value would be infinite to me.

My larger book will have to be wholly re-written, and not merely the
present volume expanded; so that I want to waste as little time over
this volume as possible, if another edition be called for; but I fear
the subject will be too perplexing, as I have treated it, for general
public.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Ilkley, Yorkshire, Sunday [October 23rd,
1859].

My dear Hooker,

I congratulate you on your 'Introduction' ("Australian Flora".) being in
fact finished. I am sure from what I read of it (and deeply I shall be
interested in reading it straight through), that it must have cost you
a prodigious amount of labour and thought. I shall like very much to
see the sheet, which you wish me to look at. Now I am so completely a
gentleman, that I have sometimes a little difficulty to pass the day;
but it is astonishing how idle a three weeks I have passed. If it is any
comfort to you, pray delude yourself by saying that you intend "sticking
to humdrum science." But I believe it just as much as if a plant were
to say that, "I have been growing all my life, and, by Jove, I will stop
growing." You cannot help yourself; you are not clever enough for that.
You could not even remain idle, as I have done, for three weeks! What
you say about Lyell pleases me exceedingly; I had not at all inferred
from his letters that he had come so much round. I remember thinking,
above a year ago, that if ever I lived to see Lyell, yourself,
and Huxley come round, partly by my book, and partly by their own
reflections, I should feel that the subject is safe, and all the world
might rail, but that ultimately the theory of Natural Selection (though,
no doubt, imperfect in its present condition, and embracing many errors)
would prevail. Nothing will ever convince me that three such men, with
so much diversified knowledge, and so well accustomed to search for
truth, could err greatly. I have spoken of you here as a convert made
by me; but I know well how much larger the share has been of your own
self-thought. I am intensely curious to hear Huxley's opinion of my
book. I fear my long discussion on Classification will disgust him; for
it is much opposed to what he once said to me.

But, how I am running on. You see how idle I am; but I have so enjoyed
your letter that you must forgive me. With respect to migration during
the glacial period: I think Lyell quite comprehends, for he has given me
a supporting fact. But, perhaps, he unconsciously hates (do not say so
to him) the view as slightly staggering him on his favourite theory of
all changes of climate being due to changes in the relative position of
land and water.

I will send copies of my book to all the men specified by you;... you
would be so kind as to add title, as Doctor, or Professor, or Monsieur,
or Von, and initials (when wanted), and addresses to the names on the
enclosed list, and let me have it pretty SOON, as towards the close
of this week Murray says the copies to go abroad will be ready. I am
anxious to get my view generally known, and not, I hope and think, for
mere personal conceit...


CHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Ilkley, Yorkshire, October 25th [1859].

...Our difference on "principle of improvement" and "power of
adaptation" is too profound for discussion by letter. If I am wrong, I
am quite blind to my error. If I am right, our difference will be got
over only by your re-reading carefully and reflecting on my first four
chapters. I supplicate you to read these again carefully. The so-called
improvement of our Shorthorn cattle, pigeons, etc., does not presuppose
or require any aboriginal "power of adaptation," or "principle of
improvement;" it requires only diversified variability, and man to
select or take advantage of those modifications which are useful to him;
so under nature any slight modification which CHANCES to arise, and is
useful to any creature, is selected or preserved in the struggle for
life; any modification which is injurious is destroyed or rejected;
any which is neither useful nor injurious will be left a fluctuating
element. When you contrast natural selection and "improvement," you seem
always to overlook (for I do not see how you can deny) that every step
in the natural selection of each species implies improvement in that
species in relation to its conditions of life. No modification can be
selected without it be an improvement or advantage. Improvement implies,
I suppose, each form obtaining many parts or organs, all excellently
adapted for their functions. As each species is improved, and as the
number of forms will have increased, if we look to the whole course of
time, the organic condition of life for other forms will become more
complex, and there will be a necessity for other forms to become
improved, or they will be exterminated; and I can see no limit to this
process of improvement, without the intervention of any other and direct
principle of improvement. All this seems to me quite compatible with
certain forms fitted for simple conditions, remaining unaltered, or
being degraded.

If I have a second edition, I will reiterate "Natural Selection," and,
as a general consequence, "Natural Improvement."

As you go, as far as you do, I begin strongly to think, judging from
myself, that you will go much further. How slowly the older geologists
admitted your grand views on existing geological causes of change!

If at any time you think I can answer any question, it is a real
pleasure to me to write.

Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.


CHARLES DARWIN TO J. MURRAY. Ilkley, Yorkshire [1859].

My dear Sir,

I have received your kind note and the copy; I am infinitely pleased and
proud at the appearance of my child.

I quite agree to all you propose about price. But you are really too
generous about the, to me, scandalously heavy corrections. Are you not
acting unfairly towards yourself? Would it not be better at least to
share the 72 pounds 8 shillings? I shall be fully satisfied, for I had
no business to send, though quite unintentionally and unexpectedly, such
badly composed MS. to the printers.

Thank you for your kind offer to distribute the copies to my friends and
assistors as soon as possible. Do not trouble yourself much about the
foreigners, as Messrs. Williams and Norgate have most kindly offered
to do their best, and they are accustomed to send to all parts of the
world.

I will pay for my copies whenever you like. I am so glad that you were
so good as to undertake the publication of my book.

My dear Sir, yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.

P.S.--Please do not forget to let me hear about two days before the
copies are distributed.

I do not know when I shall leave this place, certainly not for several
weeks. Whenever I am in London I will call on you.




CHAPTER 1.XIV. -- BY PROFESSOR HUXLEY.

ON THE RECEPTION OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'

To the present generation, that is to say, the people a few years on
the hither and thither side of thirty, the name of Charles Darwin stands
alongside of those of Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday; and, like them,
calls up the grand ideal of a searcher after truth and interpreter of
Nature. They think of him who bore it as a rare combination of genius,
industry, and unswerving veracity, who earned his place among the most
famous men of the age by sheer native power, in the teeth of a gale of
popular prejudice, and uncheered by a sign of favour or appreciation
from the official fountains of honour; as one who in spite of an acute
sensitiveness to praise and blame, and notwithstanding provocations
which might have excused any outbreak, kept himself clear of all envy,
hatred, and malice, nor dealt otherwise than fairly and justly with the
unfairness and injustice which was showered upon him; while, to the end
of his days, he was ready to listen with patience and respect to the
most insignificant of reasonable objectors.

And with respect to that theory of the origin of the forms of life
peopling our globe, with which Darwin's name is bound up as closely
as that of Newton with the theory of gravitation, nothing seems to be
further from the mind of the present generation than any attempt to
smother it with ridicule or to crush it by vehemence of denunciation.
"The struggle for existence," and "Natural selection," have become
household words and every-day conceptions. The reality and the
importance of the natural processes on which Darwin founds his
deductions are no more doubted than those of growth and multiplication;
and, whether the full potency attributed to them is admitted or not,
no one doubts their vast and far-reaching significance. Wherever the
biological sciences are studied, the 'Origin of Species' lights the
paths of the investigator; wherever they are taught it permeates the
course of instruction. Nor has the influence of Darwinian ideas
been less profound, beyond the realms of Biology. The oldest of all
philosophies, that of Evolution, was bound hand and foot and cast into
utter darkness during the millennium of theological scholasticism. But
Darwin poured new life-blood into the ancient frame; the bonds burst,
and the revivified thought of ancient Greece has proved itself to be a
more adequate expression of the universal order of things than any of
the schemes which have been accepted by the credulity and welcomed by
the superstition of seventy later generations of men.

To any one who studies the signs of the times, the emergence of the
philosophy of Evolution, in the attitude of claimant to the throne
of the world of thought, from the limbo of hated and, as many hoped,
forgotten things, is the most portentous event of the nineteenth
century. But the most effective weapons of the modern champions of
Evolution were fabricated by Darwin; and the 'Origin of Species' has
enlisted a formidable body of combatants, trained in the severe school
of Physical Science, whose ears might have long remained deaf to the
speculations of a priori philosophers.

I do not think any candid or instructed person will deny the truth
of that which has just been asserted. He may hate the very name of
Evolution, and may deny its pretensions as vehemently as a Jacobite
denied those of George the Second. But there it is--not only as
solidly seated as the Hanoverian dynasty, but happily independent of
Parliamentary sanction--and the dullest antagonists have come to see
that they have to deal with an adversary whose bones are to be broken by
no amount of bad words.

Even the theologians have almost ceased to pit the plain meaning of
Genesis against the no less plain meaning of Nature. Their more candid,
or more cautious, representatives have given up dealing with Evolution
as if it were a damnable heresy, and have taken refuge in one of two
courses. Either they deny that Genesis was meant to teach scientific
truth, and thus save the veracity of the record at the expense of
its authority; or they expend their energies in devising the cruel
ingenuities of the reconciler, and torture texts in the vain hope of
making them confess the creed of Science. But when the peine forte et
dure is over, the antique sincerity of the venerable sufferer always
reasserts itself. Genesis is honest to the core, and professes to be no
more than it is, a repository of venerable traditions of unknown origin,
claiming no scientific authority and possessing none.

As my pen finishes these passages, I can but be amused to think what
a terrible hubbub would have been made (in truth was made) about any
similar expressions of opinion a quarter of a century ago. In fact,
the contrast between the present condition of public opinion upon the
Darwinian question; between the estimation in which Darwin's views are
now held in the scientific world; between the acquiescence, or at least
quiescence, of the theologians of the self-respecting order at the
present day and the outburst of antagonism on all sides in 1858-9, when
the new theory respecting the origin of species first became known to
the older generation to which I belong, is so startling that, except
for documentary evidence, I should be sometimes inclined to think my
memories dreams. I have a great respect for the younger generation
myself (they can write our lives, and ravel out all our follies, if
they choose to take the trouble, by and by), and I should be glad to be
assured that the feeling is reciprocal; but I am afraid that the
story of our dealings with Darwin may prove a great hindrance to that
veneration for our wisdom which I should like them to display. We have
not even the excuse that, thirty years ago, Mr. Darwin was an obscure
novice, who had no claims on our attention. On the contrary, his
remarkable zoological and geological investigations had long given him
an assured position among the most eminent and original investigators of
the day; while his charming 'Voyage of a Naturalist' had justly earned
him a wide-spread reputation among the general public. I doubt if there
was any man then living who had a better right to expect that anything
he might choose to say on such a question as the Origin of Species would
be listened to with profound attention, and discussed with respect; and
there was certainly no man whose personal character should have afforded
a better safeguard against attacks, instinct with malignity and spiced
with shameless impertinences.

Yet such was the portion of one of the kindest and truest men that it
was ever my good fortune to know; and years had to pass away before
misrepresentation, ridicule, and denunciation, ceased to be the most
notable constituents of the majority of the multitudinous criticisms
of his work which poured from the press. I am loth to rake any of these
ancient scandals from their well-deserved oblivion; but I must make good
a statement which may seem overcharged to the present generation, and
there is no piece justificative more apt for the purpose, or more worthy
of such dishonour, than the article in the 'Quarterly Review' for July,
1860. (I was not aware when I wrote these passages that the authorship
of the article had been publicly acknowledged. Confession unaccompanied
by penitence, however, affords no ground for mitigation of judgment;
and the kindliness with which Mr. Darwin speaks of his assailant, Bishop
Wilberforce (vol. ii.), is so striking an exemplification of his singular
gentleness and modesty, that it rather increases one's indignation
against the presumption of his critic.) Since Lord Brougham assailed Dr.
Young, the world has seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow
pretender to a Master in Science as this remarkable production, in which
one of the most exact of observers, most cautious of reasoners, and most
candid of expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn as
a "flighty" person, who endeavours "to prop up his utterly rotten fabric
of guess and speculation," and whose "mode of dealing with nature" is
reprobated as "utterly dishonourable to Natural Science." And all this
high and mighty talk, which would have been indecent in one of Mr.
Darwin's equals, proceeds from a writer whose want of intelligence, or
of conscience, or of both, is so great, that, by way of an objection
to Mr. Darwin's views, he can ask, "Is it credible that all favourable
varieties of turnips are tending to become men;" who is so ignorant of
paleontology, that he can talk of the "flowers and fruits" of the plants
of the carboniferous epoch; of comparative anatomy, that he can gravely
affirm the poison apparatus of the venomous snakes to be "entirely
separate from the ordinary laws of animal life, and peculiar to
themselves;" of the rudiments of physiology, that he can ask, "what
advantage of life could alter the shape of the corpuscles into which
the blood can be evaporated?" Nor does the reviewer fail to flavour this
outpouring of preposterous incapacity with a little stimulation of the
odium theologicum. Some inkling of the history of the conflicts between
Astronomy, Geology, and Theology, leads him to keep a retreat open by
the proviso that he cannot "consent to test the truth of Natural Science
by the word of Revelation;" but, for all that, he devotes pages to the
exposition of his conviction that Mr. Darwin's theory "contradicts the
revealed relation of the creation to its Creator," and is "inconsistent
with the fulness of his glory."

If I confine my retrospect of the reception of the 'Origin of Species'
to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time of its publication, I do
not recollect anything quite so foolish and unmannerly as the 'Quarterly
Review' article, unless, perhaps, the address of a Reverend Professor to
the Dublin Geological Society might enter into competition with it. But
a large proportion of Mr. Darwin's critics had a lamentable resemblance
to the 'Quarterly' reviewer, in so far as they lacked either the will,
or the wit, to make themselves masters of his doctrine; hardly any
possessed the knowledge required to follow him through the immense range
of biological and geological science which the 'Origin' covered; while,
too commonly, they had prejudiced the case on theological grounds, and,
as seems to be inevitable when this happens, eked out lack of reason by
superfluity of railing.

But it will be more pleasant and more profitable to consider those
criticisms, which were acknowledged by writers of scientific authority,
or which bore internal evidence of the greater or less competency and,
often, of the good faith, of their authors. Restricting my survey to a
twelvemonth, or thereabouts, after the publication of the 'Origin,'
I find among such critics Louis Agassiz ("The arguments presented by
Darwin in favor of a universal derivation from one primary form of all
the peculiarities existing now among living beings have not made the
slightest impression on my mind.")

"Until the facts of Nature are shown to have been mistaken by those who
have collected them, and that they have a different meaning from
that now generally assigned to them, I shall therefore consider the
transmutation theory as a scientific mistake, untrue in its
facts, unscientific in its method, and mischievous in its
tendency."--Silliman's 'Journal,' July, 1860, pages 143, 154. Extract
from the 3rd volume of 'Contributions to the Natural History of the
United States.'); Murray, an excellent entomologist; Harvey, a botanist
of considerable repute; and the author of an article in the 'Edinburgh
Review,' all strongly adverse to Darwin. Pictet, the distinguished and
widely learned paleontogist of Geneva, treats Mr. Darwin with a respect
which forms a grateful contrast to the tone of some of the preceding
writers, but consents to go with him only a very little way. ("I see no
serious objections to the formation of varieties by natural selection
in the existing world, and that, so far as earlier epochs are concerned,
this law may be assumed to explain the origin of closely allied species,
supposing for this purpose a very long period of time."

"With regard to simple varieties and closely allied species, I believe
that Mr. Darwin's theory may explain many things, and throw a great
light upon numerous questions."--'Sur l'Origine de l'Espece. Par Charles
Darwin.' ('Archives des Sc. de la Bibliotheque Universelle de Geneve,'
pages 242, 243, Mars 1860.) On the other hand, Lyell, up to that time a
pillar of the anti-transmutationists (who regarded him, ever afterwards,
as Pallas Athene may have looked at Dian, after the Endymion affair),
declared himself a Darwinian, though not without putting in a serious
caveat. Nevertheless, he was a tower of strength, and his courageous
stand for truth as against consistency, did him infinite honour. As
evolutionists, sans phrase, I do not call to mind among the biologists
more than Asa Gray, who fought the battle splendidly in the United
States; Hooker, who was no less vigorous here; the present Sir John
Lubbock and myself. Wallace was far away in the Malay Archipelago; but,
apart from his direct share in the promulgation of the theory of natural
selection, no enumeration of the influences at work, at the time I am
speaking of, would be complete without the mention of his powerful essay
'On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species,' which
was published in 1855. On reading it afresh, I have been astonished to
recollect how small was the impression it made.

In France, the influence of Elie de Beaumont and of Flourens--the
former of whom is said to have "damned himself to everlasting fame" by
inventing the nickname of "la science moussante" for Evolutionism
(One is reminded of the effect of another small academic epigram. The
so-called vertebral theory of the skull is said to have been nipped in
the bud in France by the whisper of an academician to his neighbour,
that, in that case, one's head was a "vertebre pensante."),--to say
nothing of the ill-will of other powerful members of the Institut,
produced for a long time the effect of a conspiracy of silence; and many
years passed before the Academy redeemed itself from the reproach that
the name of Darwin was not to be found on the list of its members.
However, an accomplished writer, out of the range of academical
influences, M. Laugel, gave an excellent and appreciative notice of the
'Origin' in the 'Revue des Deux Mondes.' Germany took time to consider;
Bronn produced a slightly Bowdlerized translation of the 'Origin'; and
'Kladderadatsch' cut his jokes upon the ape origin of man; but I do not
call to mind that any scientific notability declared himself publicly
in 1860. (However, the man who stands next to Darwin in his influence
on modern biologists, K.E. von Baer, wrote to me, in August 1860,
expressing his general assent to evolutionist views. His phrase, "J'ai
enonce les memes idees...que M. Darwin" (volume ii.) is shown by his
subsequent writings to mean no more than this.) None of us dreamed that,
in the course of a few years, the strength (and perhaps I may add
the weakness) of "Darwinismus" would have its most extensive and most
brilliant illustrations in the land of learning. If a foreigner may
presume to speculate on the cause of this curious interval of silence,
I fancy it was that one moiety of the German biologists were orthodox at
any price, and the other moiety as distinctly heterodox. The latter were
evolutionists, a priori, already, and they must have felt the disgust
natural to deductive philosophers at being offered an inductive and
experimental foundation for a conviction which they had reached by
a shorter cut. It is undoubtedly trying to learn that, though your
conclusions may be all right, your reasons for them are all wrong, or,
at any rate, insufficient.

On the whole, then, the supporters of Mr. Darwin's views in 1860 were
numerically extremely insignificant. There is not the slightest doubt
that, if a general council of the Church scientific had been held at
that time, we should have been condemned by an overwhelming majority.
And there is as little doubt that, if such a council gathered now, the
decree would be of an exactly contrary nature. It would indicate a
lack of sense, as well as of modesty, to ascribe to the men of that
generation less capacity or less honesty than their successors possess.
What, then, are the causes which led instructed and fair-judging men of
that day to arrive at a judgment so different from that which seems
just and fair to those who follow them? That is really one of the most
interesting of all questions connected with the history of science, and
I shall try to answer it. I am afraid that in order to do so I must run
the risk of appearing egotistical. However, if I tell my own story it is
only because I know it better than that of other people.

I think I must have read the 'Vestiges' before I left England in 1846;
but, if I did, the book made very little impression upon me, and I was
not brought into serious contact with the 'Species' question until after
1850. At that time, I had long done with the Pentateuchal cosmogony,
which had been impressed upon my childish understanding as Divine truth,
with all the authority of parents and instructors, and from which it
had cost me many a struggle to get free. But my mind was unbiassed in
respect of any doctrine which presented itself, if it professed to be
based on purely philosophical and scientific reasoning. It seemed to
me then (as it does now) that "creation," in the ordinary sense of the
word, is perfectly conceivable. I find no difficulty in imagining that,
at some former period, this universe was not in existence; and that
it made its appearance in six days (or instantaneously, if that is
preferred), in consequence of the volition of some pre-existent Being.
Then, as now, the so-called a priori arguments against Theism; and,
given a Deity, against the possibility of creative acts, appeared to me
to be devoid of reasonable foundation. I had not then, and I have not
now, the smallest a priori objection to raise to the account of the
creation of animals and plants given in 'Paradise Lost,' in which Milton
so vividly embodies the natural sense of Genesis. Far be it from me to
say that it is untrue because it is impossible. I confine myself to what
must be regarded as a modest and reasonable request for some particle of
evidence that the existing species of animals and plants did originate
in that way, as a condition of my belief in a statement which appears to
me to be highly improbable.

And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to
give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. Within the ranks of the biologists,
at that time, I met with nobody, except Dr. Grant, of University
College, who had a word to say for Evolution--and his advocacy was not
calculated to advance the cause. Outside these ranks, the only person
known to me whose knowledge and capacity compelled respect, and who
was, at the same time, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert
Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852, and then entered
into the bonds of a friendship which, I am happy to think, has known
no interruption. Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this
topic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of apt
illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my
stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in
favour of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and secondly, that no
suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which
had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking
back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that
any other conclusion was justifiable.

In those days I had never even heard of Treviranus' 'Biologie.' However,
I had studied Lamarck attentively and I had read the 'Vestiges' with due
care; but neither of them afforded me any good ground for changing my
negative and critical attitude. As for the 'Vestiges,' I confess that
the book simply irritated me by the prodigious ignorance and thoroughly
unscientific habit of mind manifested by the writer. If it had any
influence on me at all, it set me against Evolution; and the only
review I ever have qualms of conscience about, on the ground of needless
savagery, is one I wrote on the 'Vestiges' while under that influence.

With respect to the 'Philosophie Zoologique,' it is no reproach to
Lamarck to say that the discussion of the Species question in that work,
whatever might be said for it in 1809, was miserably below the level
of the knowledge of half a century later. In that interval of time the
elucidation of the structure of the lower animals and plants had
given rise to wholly new conceptions of their relations; histology and
embryology, in the modern sense, had been created; physiology had been
reconstituted; the facts of distribution, geological and geographical,
had been prodigiously multiplied and reduced to order. To any biologist
whose studies had carried him beyond mere species-mongering in 1850,
one-half of Lamarck's arguments were obsolete and the other half
erroneous, or defective, in virtue of omitting to deal with the various
classes of evidence which had been brought to light since his time.
Moreover his one suggestion as to the cause of the gradual modification
of species--effort excited by change of conditions--was, on the face of
it, inapplicable to the whole vegetable world. I do not think that any
impartial judge who reads the 'Philosophie Zoologique' now, and who
afterwards takes up Lyell's trenchant and effectual criticism (published
as far back as 1830), will be disposed to allot to Lamarck a much higher
place in the establishment of biological evolution than that which
Bacon assigns to himself in relation to physical science
generally,--buccinator tantum. (Erasmus Darwin first promulgated
Lamarck's fundamental conceptions, and, with greater logical
consistency, he had applied them to plants. But the advocates of his
claims have failed to show that he, in any respect, anticipated the
central idea of the 'Origin of Species.')

But, by a curious irony of fate, the same influence which led me to
put as little faith in modern speculations on this subject, as in the
venerable traditions recorded in the first two chapters of Genesis,
was perhaps more potent than any other in keeping alive a sort of
pious conviction that Evolution, after all, would turn out true. I have
recently read afresh the first edition of the 'Principles of Geology';
and when I consider that this remarkable book had been nearly thirty
years in everybody's hands, and that it brings home to any reader of
ordinary intelligence a great principle and a great fact--the principle,
that the past must be explained by the present, unless good cause be
shown to the contrary; and the fact, that, so far as our knowledge of
the past history of life on our globe goes, no such cause can be shown
(The same principle and the same fact guide the result from all sound
historical investigation. Grote's 'History of Greece' is a product of
the same intellectual movement as Lyell's 'Principles.')--I cannot but
believe that Lyell, for others, as for myself, was the chief agent
for smoothing the road for Darwin. For consistent uniformitarianism
postulates evolution as much in the organic as in the inorganic world.
The origin of a new species by other than ordinary agencies would be a
vastly greater "catastrophe" than any of those which Lyell successfully
eliminated from sober geological speculation.

In fact, no one was better aware of this than Lyell himself. (Lyell,
with perfect right, claims this position for himself. He speaks of
having "advocated a law of continuity even in the organic world, so far
as possible without adopting Lamarck's theory of transmutation"...)

"But while I taught that as often as certain forms of animals and plants
disappeared, for reasons quite intelligible to us, others took their
place by virtue of a causation which was beyond our comprehension; it
remained for Darwin to accumulate proof that there is no break between
the incoming and the outgoing species, that they are the work of
evolution, and not of special creation...

"I had certainly prepared the way in this country, in six editions of my
work before the 'Vestiges of Creation' appeared in 1842 [1844], for
the reception of Darwin's gradual and insensible evolution of
species."--('Life and Letters,' Letter to Haeckel, volume ii. page 436.
November 23, 1868.) If one reads any of the earlier editions of the
'Principles' carefully (especially by the light of the interesting
series of letters recently published by Sir Charles Lyell's biographer),
it is easy to see that, with all his energetic opposition to Lamarck, on
the one hand, and to the ideal quasi-progressionism of Agassiz, on the
other, Lyell, in his own mind, was strongly disposed to account for the
origination of all past and present species of living things by natural
causes. But he would have liked, at the same time, to keep the name of
creation for a natural process which he imagined to be incomprehensible.

In a letter addressed to Mantell (dated March 2, 1827), Lyell speaks
of having just read Lamarck; he expresses his delight at Lamarck's
theories, and his personal freedom from any objection based on
theological grounds. And though he is evidently alarmed at the pithecoid
origin of man involved in Lamarck's doctrine, he observes:--

"But, after all, what changes species may really undergo! How impossible
will it be to distinguish and lay down a line, beyond which some of the
so-called extinct species have never passed into recent ones."

Again, the following remarkable passage occurs in the postscript of a
letter addressed to Sir John Herschel in 1836:--

"In regard to the origination of new species, I am very glad to find
that you think it probable that it may be carried on through the
intervention of intermediate causes. I left this rather to be inferred,
not thinking it worth while to offend a certain class of persons by
embodying in words what would only be a speculation." (In the same
sense, see the letter to Whewell, March 7, 1837, volume ii., page 5):--

"In regard to this last subject [the changes from one set of animal and
vegetable species to another]...you remember what Herschel said in his
letter to me. If I had stated as plainly as he has done the possibility
of the introduction or origination of fresh species being a natural, in
contradistinction to a miraculous process, I should have raised a host
of prejudices against me, which are unfortunately opposed at every
step to any philosopher who attempts to address the public on these
mysterious subjects." See also letter to Sedgwick, January 12, 1838 ii.
page 35.) He goes on to refer to the criticisms which have been directed
against him on the ground that, by leaving species to be originated by
miracle, he is inconsistent with his own doctrine of uniformitarianism;
and he leaves it to be understood that he had not replied, on the ground
of his general objection to controversy.

Lyell's contemporaries were not without some inkling of his esoteric
doctrine. Whewell's 'History of the Inductive Sciences,' whatever its
philosophical value, is always worth reading and always interesting, if
under no other aspect than that of an evidence of the speculative limits
within which a highly-placed divine might, at that time, safely range
at will. In the course of his discussion of uniformitarianism, the
encyclopaedic Master of Trinity observes:--

"Mr. Lyell, indeed, has spoken of an hypothesis that 'the successive
creation of species may constitute a regular part of the economy of
nature,' but he has nowhere, I think, so described this process as
to make it appear in what department of science we are to place the
hypothesis. Are these new species created by the production, at long
intervals, of an offspring different in species from the parents? Or
are the species so created produced without parents? Are they gradually
evolved from some embryo substance? Or do they suddenly start from the
ground, as in the creation of the poet?...

"Some selection of one of these forms of the hypothesis, rather than the
others, with evidence for the selection, is requisite to entitle us to
place it among the known causes of change, which in this chapter we are
considering. The bare conviction that a creation of species has taken
place, whether once or many times, so long as it is unconnected with
our organical sciences, is a tenet of Natural Theology rather than of
Physical Philosophy." (Whewell's 'History,' volume iii. page 639-640
(Edition 2, 1847.))

The earlier part of this criticism appears perfectly just and
appropriate; but, from the concluding paragraph, Whewell evidently
imagines that by "creation" Lyell means a preternatural intervention of
the Deity; whereas the letter to Herschel shows that, in his own
mind, Lyell meant natural causation; and I see no reason to doubt (The
following passages in Lyell's letters appear to me decisive on this
point):--

To Darwin, October 3, 1859 (ii, 325), on first reading the 'Origin.'

"I have long seen most clearly that if any concession is made, all that
you claim in your concluding pages will follow.

"It is this which has made me so long hesitate, always feeling that the
case of Man and his Races, and of other animals, and that of plants, is
one and the same, and that if a vera causa be admitted for one instant,
[instead] of a purely unknown and imaginary one, such as the word
'creation,' all the consequences must follow."

To Darwin, March 15, 1863 (volume ii. page 365).

"I remember that it was the conclusion he [Lamarck] came to about man
that fortified me thirty years ago against the great impression which
his arguments at first made on my mind, all the greater because Constant
Prevost, a pupil of Cuvier's forty years ago, told me his conviction
'that Cuvier thought species not real, but that science could not
advance without assuming that they were so.'"

To Hooker, March 9, 1863 (volume ii. page 361), in reference to Darwin's
feeling about the 'Antiquity of Man.'

"He [Darwin] seems much disappointed that I do not go farther with him,
or do not speak out more. I can only say that I have spoken out to
the full extent of my present convictions, and even beyond my state of
FEELING as to man's unbroken descent from the brutes, and I find I am
half converting not a few who were in arms against Darwin, and are even
now against Huxley." He speaks of having had to abandon "old and long
cherished ideas, which constituted the charm to me of the theoretical
part of the science in my earlier day, when I believed with Pascal in
the theory, as Hallam terms it, of 'the arch-angel ruined.'"

See the same sentiment in the letter to Darwin, March 11, 1863, page
363:--

"I think the old 'creation' is almost as much required as ever, but
of course it takes a new form if Lamarck's views improved by yours
are adopted." that, if Sir Charles could have avoided the inevitable
corollary of the pithecoid origin of man--for which, to the end of his
life, he entertained a profound antipathy--he would have advocated the
efficiency of causes now in operation to bring about the condition
of the organic world, as stoutly as he championed that doctrine in
reference to inorganic nature.

The fact is, that a discerning eye might have seen that some form or
other of the doctrine of transmutation was inevitable, from the time
when the truth enunciated by William Smith that successive strata are
characterised by different kinds of fossil remains, became a firmly
established law of nature. No one has set forth the speculative
consequences of this generalisation better than the historian of the
'Inductive Sciences':--

"But the study of geology opens to us the spectacle of many groups of
species which have, in the course of the earth's history, succeeded
each other at vast intervals of time; one set of animals and plants
disappearing, as it would seem, from the face of our planet, and others,
which did not before exist, becoming the only occupants of the globe.
And the dilemma then presents itself to us anew:--either we must accept
the doctrine of the transmutation of species, and must suppose that the
organized species of one geological epoch were transmuted into those
of another by some long-continued agency of natural causes; or else,
we must believe in many successive acts of creation and extinction of
species, out of the common course of nature; acts which, therefore,
we may properly call miraculous." (Whewell's 'History of the Inductive
Sciences.' Edition ii., 1847, volume iii. pages 624-625. See for the
author's verdict, pages 638- 39.)

Dr. Whewell decides in favour of the latter conclusion. And if any one
had plied him with the four questions which he puts to Lyell in the
passage already cited, all that can be said now is that he would
certainly have rejected the first. But would he really have had the
courage to say that a Rhinoceros tichorhinus, for instance, "was
produced without parents;" or was "evolved from some embryo substance;"
or that it suddenly started from the ground like Milton's lion "pawing
to get free his hinder parts." I permit myself to doubt whether even
the Master of Trinity's well-tried courage--physical, intellectual,
and moral--would have been equal to this feat. No doubt the sudden
concurrence of half-a-ton of inorganic molecules into a live rhinoceros
is conceivable, and therefore may be possible. But does such an event
lie sufficiently within the bounds of probability to justify the
belief in its occurrence on the strength of any attainable, or, indeed,
imaginable, evidence?

In view of the assertion (often repeated in the early days of the
opposition to Darwin) that he had added nothing to Lamarck, it is very
interesting to observe that the possibility of a fifth alternative, in
addition to the four he has stated, has not dawned upon Dr. Whewell's
mind. The suggestion that new species may result from the selective
action of external conditions upon the variations from their specific
type which individuals present--and which we call "spontaneous,"
because we are ignorant of their causation--is as wholly unknown to the
historian of scientific ideas as it was to biological specialists
before 1858. But that suggestion is the central idea of the 'Origin of
Species,' and contains the quintessence of Darwinism.

Thus, looking back into the past, it seems to me that my own position
of critical expectancy was just and reasonable, and must have been taken
up, on the same grounds, by many other persons. If Agassiz told me that
the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the
incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped
out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe
as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not
only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of
paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I
had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his
explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the
explanation explained. Neither did it help me to be told by an eminent
anatomist that species had succeeded one another in time, in virtue of
"a continuously operative creational law." That seemed to me to be no
more than saying that species had succeeded one another, in the form of
a vote-catching resolution, with "law" to please the man of science,
and "creational" to draw the orthodox. So I took refuge in that "thatige
Skepsis" which Goethe has so well defined; and, reversing the apostolic
precept to be all things to all men, I usually defended the tenability
of the received doctrines, when I had to do with the transmutationists;
and stood up for the possibility of transmutation among the
orthodox--thereby, no doubt, increasing an already current, but quite
undeserved, reputation for needless combativeness.

I remember, in the course of my first interview with Mr. Darwin,
expressing my belief in the sharpness of the lines of demarcation
between natural groups and in the absence of transitional forms, with
all the confidence of youth and imperfect knowledge. I was not aware,
at that time, that he had then been many years brooding over the
species-question; and the humorous smile which accompanied his gentle
answer, that such was not altogether his view, long haunted and puzzled
me. But it would seem that four or five years' hard work had enabled me
to understand what it meant; for Lyell ('Life and Letters,' volume ii.
page 212.), writing to Sir Charles Bunbury (under date of April 30,
1856), says:--

"When Huxley, Hooker, and Wollaston were at Darwin's last week they (all
four of them) ran a tilt against species--further, I believe, than they
are prepared to go."

I recollect nothing of this beyond the fact of meeting Mr. Wollaston;
and except for Sir Charles' distinct assurance as to "all four," I
should have thought my "outrecuidance" was probably a counterblast to
Wollaston's conservatism. With regard to Hooker, he was already,
like Voltaire's Habbakuk, "capable du tout" in the way of advocating
Evolution.

As I have already said, I imagine that most of those of my
contemporaries who thought seriously about the matter, were very much
in my own state of mind--inclined to say to both Mosaists and
Evolutionists, "a plague on both your houses!" and disposed to turn
aside from an interminable and apparently fruitless discussion,
to labour in the fertile fields of ascertainable fact. And I may,
therefore, further suppose that the publication of the Darwin and
Wallace papers in 1858, and still more that of the 'Origin' in 1859, had
the effect upon them of the flash of light, which to a man who has lost
himself in a dark night, suddenly reveals a road which, whether it takes
him straight home or not, certainly goes his way. That which we were
looking for, and could not find, was a hypothesis respecting the origin
of known organic forms, which assumed the operation of no causes but
such as could be proved to be actually at work. We wanted, not to pin
our faith to that or any other speculation, but to get hold of clear and
definite conceptions which could be brought face to face with facts and
have their validity tested. The 'Origin' provided us with the working
hypothesis we sought. Moreover, it did the immense service of freeing us
for ever from the dilemma--refuse to accept the creation hypothesis, and
what have you to propose that can be accepted by any cautious reasoner?
In 1857, I had no answer ready, and I do not think that any one else
had. A year later, we reproached ourselves with dullness for being
perplexed by such an inquiry. My reflection, when I first made myself
master of the central idea of the 'Origin,' was, "How extremely stupid
not to have thought of that!" I suppose that Columbus' companions
said much the same when he made the egg stand on end. The facts of
variability, of the struggle for existence, of adaptation to conditions,
were notorious enough; but none of us had suspected that the road to the
heart of the species problem lay through them, until Darwin and Wallace
dispelled the darkness, and the beacon-fire of the 'Origin' guided the
benighted.

Whether the particular shape which the doctrine of evolution, as applied
to the organic world, took in Darwin's hands, would prove to be final or
not, was, to me, a matter of indifference. In my earliest criticisms
of the 'Origin' I ventured to point out that its logical foundation was
insecure so long as experiments in selective breeding had not produced
varieties which were more or less infertile; and that insecurity remains
up to the present time. But, with any and every critical doubt which
my sceptical ingenuity could suggest, the Darwinian hypothesis remained
incomparably more probable than the creation hypothesis. And if we had
none of us been able to discern the paramount significance of some of
the most patent and notorious of natural facts, until they were, so
to speak, thrust under our noses, what force remained in the
dilemma--creation or nothing? It was obvious that, hereafter, the
probability would be immensely greater, that the links of natural
causation were hidden from our purblind eyes, than that natural
causation should be incompetent to produce all the phenomena of nature.
The only rational course for those who had no other object than the
attainment of truth, was to accept "Darwinism" as a working hypothesis,
and see what could be made of it. Either it would prove its capacity to
elucidate the facts of organic life, or it would break down under the
strain. This was surely the dictate of common sense; and, for once,
common sense carried the day. The result has been that complete
volte-face of the whole scientific world, which must seem so surprising
to the present generation. I do not mean to say that all the leaders of
biological science have avowed themselves Darwinians; but I do not think
that there is a single zoologist, or botanist, or palaeontologist, among
the multitude of active workers of this generation, who is other than an
evolutionist, profoundly influenced by Darwin's views. Whatever may
be the ultimate fate of the particular theory put forth by Darwin, I
venture to affirm that, so far as my knowledge goes, all the ingenuity
and all the learning of hostile critics have not enabled them to adduce
a solitary fact, of which it can be said, this is irreconcilable with
the Darwinian theory. In the prodigious variety and complexity of
organic nature, there are multitudes of phenomena which are not
deducible from any generalisations we have yet reached. But the same
may be said of every other class of natural objects. I believe that
astronomers cannot yet get the moon's motions into perfect accordance
with the theory of gravitation.

It would be inappropriate, even if it were possible, to discuss the
difficulties and unresolved problems which have hitherto met the
evolutionist, and which will probably continue to puzzle him for
generations to come, in the course of this brief history of the
reception of Mr. Darwin's great work. But there are two or three
objections of a more general character, based, or supposed to be based,
upon philosophical and theological foundations, which were loudly
expressed in the early days of the Darwinian controversy, and which,
though they have been answered over and over again, crop up now and then
to the present day.

The most singular of these, perhaps immortal, fallacies, which live on,
Tithonus-like, when sense and force have long deserted them, is that
which charges Mr. Darwin with having attempted to reinstate the old
pagan goddess, Chance. It is said that he supposes variations to come
about "by chance," and that the fittest survive the "chances" of
the struggle for existence, and thus "chance" is substituted for
providential design.

It is not a little wonderful that such an accusation as this should
be brought against a writer who has, over and over again, warned his
readers that when he uses the word "spontaneous," he merely means that
he is ignorant of the cause of that which is so termed; and whose whole
theory crumbles to pieces if the uniformity and regularity of natural
causation for illimitable past ages is denied. But probably the best
answer to those who talk of Darwinism meaning the reign of "chance," is
to ask them what they themselves understand by "chance"? Do they believe
that anything in this universe happens without reason or without a
cause? Do they really conceive that any event has no cause, and could
not have been predicted by any one who had a sufficient insight into
the order of Nature? If they do, it is they who are the inheritors of
antique superstition and ignorance, and whose minds have never been
illumined by a ray of scientific thought. The one act of faith in the
convert to science, is the confession of the universality of order and
of the absolute validity in all times and under all circumstances, of
the law of causation. This confession is an act of faith, because,
by the nature of the case, the truth of such propositions is not
susceptible of proof. But such faith is not blind, but reasonable;
because it is invariably confirmed by experience, and constitutes the
sole trustworthy foundation for all action.

If one of these people, in whom the chance-worship of our remoter
ancestors thus strangely survives, should be within reach of the sea
when a heavy gale is blowing, let him betake himself to the shore and
watch the scene. Let him note the infinite variety of form and size of
the tossing waves out at sea; or of the curves of their foam-crested
breakers, as they dash against the rocks; let him listen to the roar and
scream of the shingle as it is cast up and torn down the beach; or look
at the flakes of foam as they drive hither and thither before the wind;
or note the play of colours, which answers a gleam of sunshine as it
falls upon the myriad bubbles. Surely here, if anywhere, he will say
that chance is supreme, and bend the knee as one who has entered the
very penetralia of his divinity. But the man of science knows that here,
as everywhere, perfect order is manifested; that there is not a curve
of the waves, not a note in the howling chorus, not a rainbow-glint on
a bubble, which is other than a necessary consequence of the ascertained
laws of nature; and that with a sufficient knowledge of the conditions,
competent physico-mathematical skill could account for, and indeed
predict, every one of these "chance" events.

A second very common objection to Mr. Darwin's views was (and is), that
they abolish Teleology, and eviscerate the argument from design. It
is nearly twenty years since I ventured to offer some remarks on this
subject, and as my arguments have as yet received no refutation, I hope
I may be excused for reproducing them. I observed, "that the doctrine
of Evolution is the most formidable opponent of all the commoner and
coarser forms of Teleology. But perhaps the most remarkable service to
the Philosophy of Biology rendered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation
of Teleology and Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both,
which his views offer. The teleology which supposes that the eye, such
as we see it in man, or one of the higher vertebrata, was made with the
precise structure it exhibits, for the purpose of enabling the animal
which possesses it to see, has undoubtedly received its death-blow.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that there is a wider
teleology which is not touched by the doctrine of Evolution, but is
actually based upon the fundamental proposition of Evolution. This
proposition is that the whole world, living and not living, is the
result of the mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the
forces (I should now like to substitute the word powers for "forces.")
possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity of the
universe was composed. If this be true, it is no less certain that
the existing world lay potentially in the cosmic vapour, and that a
sufficient intelligence could, from a knowledge of the properties of the
molecules of that vapour, have predicted, say the state of the fauna of
Britain in 1869, with as much certainty as one can say what will happen
to the vapour of the breath on a cold winter's day...

...The teleological and the mechanical views of nature are not,
necessarily, mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the more purely a
mechanist the speculator is, the more firmly does he assume a primordial
molecular arrangement of which all the phenomena of the universe are the
consequences, and the more completely is he thereby at the mercy of the
teleologist, who can always defy him to disprove that this primordial
molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve the phenomena of the
universe." (The "Genealogy of Animals" ('The Academy,' 1869), reprinted
in 'Critiques and Addresses.')

The acute champion of Teleology, Paley, saw no difficulty in admitting
that the "production of things" may be the result of trains of
mechanical dispositions fixed beforehand by intelligent appointment and
kept in action by a power at the centre ('Natural Theology,' chapter
xxiii.), that is to say, he proleptically accepted the modern doctrine
of Evolution; and his successors might do well to follow their leader,
or at any rate to attend to his weighty reasonings, before rushing into
an antagonism which has no reasonable foundation.

Having got rid of the belief in chance and the disbelief in design,
as in no sense appurtenances of Evolution, the third libel upon that
doctrine, that it is anti-theistic, might perhaps be left to shift for
itself. But the persistence with which many people refuse to draw the
plainest consequences from the propositions they profess to accept,
renders it advisable to remark that the doctrine of Evolution is neither
Anti-theistic nor Theistic. It simply has no more to do with Theism
than the first book of Euclid has. It is quite certain that a normal
fresh-laid egg contains neither cock nor hen; and it is also as certain
as any proposition in physics or morals, that if such an egg is kept
under proper conditions for three weeks, a cock or hen chicken will be
found in it. It is also quite certain that if the shell were transparent
we should be able to watch the formation of the young fowl, day by day,
by a process of evolution, from a microscopic cellular germ to its
full size and complication of structure. Therefore Evolution, in the
strictest sense, is actually going on in this and analogous millions and
millions of instances, wherever living creatures exist. Therefore,
to borrow an argument from Butler, as that which now happens must be
consistent with the attributes of the Deity, if such a Being exists,
Evolution must be consistent with those attributes. And, if so, the
evolution of the universe, which is neither more nor less explicable
than that of a chicken, must also be consistent with them. The doctrine
of Evolution, therefore, does not even come into contact with Theism,
considered as a philosophical doctrine. That with which it does collide,
and with which it is absolutely inconsistent, is the conception of
creation, which theological speculators have based upon the history
narrated in the opening of the book of Genesis.

There is a great deal of talk and not a little lamentation about the
so-called religious difficulties which physical science has created.
In theological science, as a matter of fact, it has created none. Not
a solitary problem presents itself to the philosophical Theist, at the
present day, which has not existed from the time that philosophers began
to think out the logical grounds and the logical consequences of Theism.
All the real or imaginary perplexities which flow from the conception
of the universe as a determinate mechanism, are equally involved in
the assumption of an Eternal, Omnipotent and Omniscient Deity. The
theological equivalent of the scientific conception of order is
Providence; and the doctrine of determinism follows as surely from
the attributes of foreknowledge assumed by the theologian, as from the
universality of natural causation assumed by the man of science. The
angels in 'Paradise Lost' would have found the task of enlightening Adam
upon the mysteries of "Fate, Foreknowledge, and Free-will," not a whit
more difficult, if their pupil had been educated in a "Real-schule" and
trained in every laboratory of a modern university. In respect of the
great problems of Philosophy, the post-Darwinian generation is, in one
sense, exactly where the prae-Darwinian generations were. They remain
insoluble. But the present generation has the advantage of being better
provided with the means of freeing itself from the tyranny of certain
sham solutions.

The known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on
an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our
business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land, to add
something to the extent and the solidity of our possessions. And even a
cursory glance at the history of the biological sciences during the last
quarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion, that
the most potent instrument for the extension of the realm of natural
knowledge which has come into men's hands, since the publication of
Newton's 'Principia,' is Darwin's 'Origin of Species.'

It was badly received by the generation to which it was first addressed,
and the outpouring of angry nonsense to which it gave rise is sad to
think upon. But the present generation will probably behave just as
badly if another Darwin should arise, and inflict upon them that which
the generality of mankind most hate--the necessity of revising their
convictions. Let them, then, be charitable to us ancients; and if they
behave no better than the men of my day to some new benefactor, let them
recollect that, after all, our wrath did not come to much, and vented
itself chiefly in the bad language of sanctimonious scolds. Let them
as speedily perform a strategic right-about-face, and follow the truth
wherever it leads. The opponents of the new truth will discover, as
those of Darwin are doing, that, after all, theories do not alter facts,
and that the universe remains unaffected even though texts crumble. Or,
it may be, that, as history repeats itself, their happy ingenuity will
also discover that the new wine is exactly of the same vintage as
the old, and that (rightly viewed) the old bottles prove to have been
expressly made for holding it.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
